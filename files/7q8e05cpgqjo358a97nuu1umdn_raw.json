How Did That Happen?\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"Just a few years ago, Microsoft was seen as a lumbering has-been. Now it\u2019s a contender for the title of the world\u2019s most valuable company.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>Just a few years ago, Microsoft was seen as a lumbering has-been of the technology world.\\r\\n<br>It was big and still quite profitable, but the company had lost its luster, failing or trailing in the markets of the future like mobile, search, online advertising and cloud computing. Its stock price languished, inching up 3 percent in the decade through the end of 2012.\\r\\n<br>It\u2019s a very different story today. Microsoft is running neck and neck with Apple for the title of the world\u2019s most valuable company, both worth about $850 billion, thanks to a stock price that has climbed 30 percent over the last 12 months. At the end of trading Friday, Microsoft was just ahead of its longtime rival.\\r\\n<br>So what happened?\\r\\n<h2>The company built on its strengths\\r\\n<br>There is a short-term explanation for Microsoft\u2019s market rise, and there is a longer-term one.\\r\\n<br>The near-term, stock-trading answer is that Microsoft has held up better than others during the recent sell-off of tech company shares. Apple investors are worried about a slowdown in iPhone sales. Facebook and Google face persistent attacks on their role in distributing false news and conspiracy theories, and investor concerns that their privacy policies could scare off users and advertisers.\\r\\n<p>But the more enduring and important answer is that Microsoft has become a case study of how a once-dominant company can build on its strengths and avoid being a prisoner of its past. It has fully embraced cloud computing, abandoned an errant foray into smartphones and returned to its roots as mainly a supplier of technology to business customers.\\r\\n<br>That strategy was outlined by Satya Nadella shortly after he became chief executive in 2014. Since then, Microsoft\u2019s stock price has nearly tripled.\\r\\n<h2>It bet big on the cloud and won \u2026\\r\\n<p>Microsoft\u2019s path to cloud computing \u2014 processing, storage and software delivered as a service over the internet from remote data centers \u2014 was lengthy and sometimes halting.\\r\\n<br>Its forerunners to cloud computing go back to the 1990s, with Microsoft\u2019s MSN online service and later its Bing search engine. In 2010, four years after Amazon entered the cloud market, Microsoft introduced its cloud service. But it did not have an offering comparable to Amazon\u2019s until 2013, analysts say.\\r\\n<p>Even then, Microsoft\u2019s cloud service was a side business. The corporate center of gravity remained its Windows operating system, the linchpin of the company\u2019s wealth and power during the personal computer era. That changed after Mr. Nadella replaced Steven A. Ballmer, who had been chief executive for 14 years.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Nadella made the cloud service a top priority, and the company is now a strong No. 2 to Amazon. Microsoft has nearly doubled its share of that market to 13 percent since the end of 2015, according to the Synergy Research Group. Amazon\u2019s share has held steady at 33 percent over that span.\\r\\n<br>Microsoft has also retooled its popular Office apps like Word, Excel and PowerPoint in a cloud version, Office 365. That offering caters to people who prefer to use software as an internet service and gives Microsoft a competitive entry against online app suppliers like Google.\\r\\n<br>The financial payoff from the shift came gradually at first, but is accelerating. In the year that ended in June, Microsoft\u2019s revenue rose 15 percent, to $110 billion, and operating profit increased 13 percent, to $35 billion.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThe essence of what Satya Nadella did was the dramatic shift to the cloud,\u201d said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \u201cHe put Microsoft back into a high-growth business.\u201d\\r\\n<br>It is the perception that Microsoft is on a high-growth track that has fueled its rising share price.\\r\\n<p><h2>\u2026 while walking away from losing bets\\r\\n<p>When Microsoft acquired Nokia\u2019s mobile phone business in 2013, Mr. Ballmer hailed the move as a \u201cbold step into the future.\u201d Two years later, Mr. Nadella walked away from that future, taking a $7.6 billion charge, nearly the entire value of the purchase, and shedding 7,800 workers.\\r\\n<br>Microsoft would not try to compete with the smartphone technology leaders, Apple, Google and Samsung. Instead, Microsoft focused on its developing apps and other software for business customers.\\r\\n<br>Microsoft does have a successful consumer franchise in its Xbox video game business. But it is a separate unit, and though it generates revenue of $10 billion, that is still less than 10 percent of the company\u2019s overall sales.\\r\\n<br>Microsoft products, in the main, are about utility \u2014 productivity tools, whether people use them at work or at home. And its Azure cloud technology is a service for businesses and a platform for software developers to build applications, a kind of cloud operating system.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Nadella\u2019s big acquisitions have been intended to add to its offerings for business users and developers. In 2016, Microsoft bought LinkedIn, the social network for professionals, for $26.2 billion.\\r\\n<br>\u201cIt\u2019s really the coming together of the professional cloud and the professional network,\u201d Mr. Nadella explained at the time.\\r\\n<br>This year, Microsoft paid $7.5 billion for GitHub, an open software platform used by 28 million programmers.\\r\\n<p><h2>It has opened up its technology and culture\\r\\n<br>Under Mr. Nadella, Microsoft has loosened up. Windows would no longer be its center of gravity \u2014 or its anchor. Microsoft apps would run not only on Apple\u2019s Macintosh software but on other operating systems as well. Open source and free software, once anathema to Microsoft, was embraced as a vital tool of modern software development.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Nadella preached an outward-looking mind-set. \u201cWe need to be insatiable in our desire to learn from the outside and bring that learning into Microsoft,\u201d he wrote in his book \u201cHit Refresh,\u201d published last year.\\r\\n<br>The company\u2019s financial performance \u2014 and its stock price \u2014 suggest that the Nadella formula is working.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThe old, Windows-centric view of the world stifled innovation,\u201d said Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management. \u201cThe company has changed culturally.

More carbs? How should we eat for peak athletic performance?\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>More fat? More carbs? What kind? How much? When? \\r\\n<br>Questions about what constitutes an ideal and practical diet for competitive athletes consume and confuse many athletes, as well as their coaches and families. But a new, comprehensive review about the science of sports nutrition published recently in Science provides a lucid overview of what currently is known \u2014 and not known \u2014 about how athletes should eat.\\r\\n<br>To find out more about these and other topics, I spoke with Louise Burke, a sports dietitian and professor at Australian Catholic University who has worked with many elite Australian sports teams. She wrote the new review with her husband John Hawley, the director of the Mary MacKillop Institute for Health Research at Australian Catholic University. What follows are edited and summarized excerpts from our conversation.\\r\\n<br>Q. In your review, you write that \u201ccarbohydrates are the predominant and critical substrate for working muscles\u201d and that \u201cthe availability of carbohydrates, rather than fat, wins gold medals.\u201d So athletes should be eating and drinking carbs?\\r\\n<br>A. Broadly speaking, if you had to stretch a big umbrella over the whole sports world and say, what dietary approach will bring the most performance benefits to the most types of athletes, then, yes, a high-carb diet would usually be the answer.\\r\\n<p>Q. In practical terms, how much carbohydrate are we talking about, especially during competition?\\r\\n<br>A. Based on what we know now, it looks like 30 to 60 grams of carbohydrates per hour during endurance events lasting several hours would be the sweet spot for most athletes. [For reference, a typical packet of a sports gel contains around 30 grams of carbohydrates, as does a banana or most single-serving bottles of sports drinks.]\\r\\n<br>Q. Some people, including me, might find it difficult to stomach so much food or drink during a race. Any advice?\\r\\n<br>A. Train your gut, just like you train your muscles. In the buildup to an event, practice with the foods or drinks you plan to have during the event, adding more, slowly. Some people find that combining multiple kinds of carbs, like glucose with fructose, are more tolerable than either one alone, probably because they are metabolized along slightly different pathways in the body. It\u2019s also clear that you can swish sports drinks around in your mouth and spit without swallowing and your brain will interpret this as meaning you have more energy available. I think that\u2019s fascinating and it can be useful, if you can\u2019t stomach more carbs just then.\\r\\n<br>Q. The big controversy in sports nutrition right now seems to involve high-fat diets, which some people claim are better for performance than high-carb diets. Do we know whether one approach is really better for athletes?\\r\\n<br>A. [Dr. Burke noted that \u201cthe issue is so much more complicated than the Twitterverse would have people believe.\u201d Carbohydrates remain muscles\u2019 preferred fuel choice during exercise, she explained, because they can be metabolized so quickly. But our bodies contain much larger stores of fat than carbohydrates, so it makes intuitive sense that we might want to become better able to use that substantial fuel source, perhaps by eating a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet.]\\r\\n<p>Q. But in the real world, do high-fat diets improve performance?\\r\\n<br>A. It depends on what kind of event someone competes in. In long, relatively low-intensity events like ultramarathons, fat might provide enough fuel. But even then, if someone wants to sprint at the end, they are going to need carbohydrates for that burst of exertion. For more intense events, there is evidence that high-fat diets impair performance. In our research with elite race walkers, we found that after they went on a high-fat diet, they could not train as hard and their competitive results suffered.\\r\\n<br>Q. So athletes shouldn\u2019t try high-fat diets?\\r\\n<br>A. I wouldn\u2019t say that at all. Some athletes love them. And we know that high-fat diets stimulate different molecular changes in the muscles than high-carb diets, some of which could be beneficial for performance.\\r\\n<br>[A practical compromise approach that allows competitors\u2019 bodies to adjust to using both carbohydrates and fats efficiently, Dr. Burke continued, involves a technique called \u201ctrain-high, sleep-low,\u201d during which an athlete works out strenuously in the afternoon to deplete his or her body of carbohydrate stores, eats a high-fat, low-carbohydrate dinner, completes a long, slow workout in the morning, and then consumes a gloriously large, high-carbohydrate breakfast before training vigorously again. Dr. Burke threads this technique occasionally into her own training for marathons and other events, she says. ]\\r\\n<br>Q. What about protein?\\r\\n<br>A. That\u2019s an interesting topic. We know that most athletes need more protein than the standard dietary allowances call for, to help in muscle repair. But we also are learning, by studying athletes, how important sufficient protein is likely to be for nonathletes, especially older people, if they want to maintain muscle mass.\\r\\n<br>Q. With all the emerging science about nutrition and sports, what overall advice would you give a recreational athlete about how to eat?\\r\\n<br>A. Talk to a sports dietitian. I think many recreational athletes get caught up in trends and forget the basics. If you are an Olympic athlete, then, yes, the minutiae of your diet\u2019s composition and timing are very consequential. The rest of us should concentrate on simple, healthy eating.\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"health.4.txt\",\"id\":1019667238},{\"title\":\"Knickers the Steer Really Is Big.

It reminded me of an old video game called Diablo, which had a secret cow level. In it, quickly multiplying bipedal Holsteins surrounded and killed your avatar. \\r\\n<br>That\u2019s about as close as most of us get to Holsteins, which actually walk on all four legs and are very gentle. We all kind of know that, which is why the secret cow level was so weird and disturbing, and perhaps why Gary Larson put them in so many cartoons. That and the guilt so many people feel about their ignorance of the lives of the animals that end up on sesame seed buns.\\r\\n<br>Not only do we eat them, we know almost nothing about them, which no doubt has something to do with why we eat them. But we don\u2019t even know how big they are anymore.\\r\\n<p>Enter Knickers. Now that his meme is waning, it seems that we should all reflect on the simple fact that most of us had no idea how big cattle actually are, how big Holsteins are, and certainly not even an inkling of how big Holstein steers are, and what they do for a living, while they are living. \\r\\n<br>The short answer is that they mostly don\u2019t live past 15 months, because Holsteins are mostly dairy cows. There is no such thing as a dairy steer.\\r\\n<br>When they do live to maturity, around 4 years old, they get really, really, really big, like Knickers. He is 6-foot-4 at the shoulders and weighs about 3,000 pounds. \\r\\n<br>When I was invited to come to the shelter and put Knickers in some perspective, an old song by an old folk singer came to mind, and I heard David Bromberg\u2019s twangy whine insisting, \u201cStand beside me when you measure my size.\u201d So I did.\\r\\n<p>At the shelter here, I stood amid three steers, Orlando, Milbank and Lawrence, all of which reached about 6-foot-4 at the shoulder and weighed 3,000 pounds.\\r\\n<p>Sam, of similar size, was at another barn. And the other Holsteins in the barn, some of whose ears I scratched, were not more than a few inches shorter. What are they? Merely enormous?\\r\\n<br>[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\\r\\n<br>Oh, and there was Tweed, at 6-foot-8. I actually drove to the shelter to see him, but he had some skeletal abnormalities so I wasn\u2019t sure how to count him if we were judging for the record. But the point that Susie Coston, the national shelter director for Farm Sanctuary, wanted to make wasn\u2019t that her cattle could beat out Knickers for some imaginary large animal gold medal.\\r\\n<br>The point, she said, was \u201cthat\u2019s the norm.\u201d We just don\u2019t see them. \\r\\n<br>Or, as Tara Hess, the shelter manager at Watkins Glen, said, \u201cWe don\u2019t actually know what\u2019s normal.\u201d\\r\\n<p>Ms. Hess introduced me to the Holsteins and to Rory the pig and a few chickens, a tiny sampling of the cattle, goats, sheep, ducks, geese, chickens and turkeys that live here. \\r\\n<br>All of them are bigger than the animals raised for food, which are slaughtered young. Among the chickens at the shelter, for instance, is an 18-pound broiler, Ms. Hess said. Broilers are usually slaughtered around eight weeks of age. This one, somehow, happened to grow up.\\r\\n<p>Standing next to the steers was, above all, disturbing. I thought of hamburgers past, as pretty much every nonvegetarian who visits must. And I thought of such vast animals being so inconsequential to the industry that bred them. And I thought about Gary Larson cartoons. \\r\\n<br>By the way, if you think Gary Larson embellished on cow personality, or that cattle would never surround you as they did in Diablo, Ms. Hess said that the idea that cattle have no personality is completely wrong.\\r\\n<br>Not only are they all different \u2014 some like to be scratched, some like you to just back off \u2014 \u201cThey are fiercely loyal to each other.\u201d\\r\\n<br>When one dies, she says, sometimes they won\u2019t let you near the dead animal. They surround the corpse and bellow in what she said is mourning.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThey\u2019ll even take out the veterinarian\u2019s car,\u201d she said.\\r\\n<br>And, in case you haven\u2019t stood next to one recently, the Holsteins are really, really big.\\r\\n<p>\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"science.1.txt\",\"id\":1931849565},{\"title\":\"Your Money: We Went to a Steak Dinner Annuity Pitch.

It said a guest was welcome, too. I volunteered, and she registered me as well. \\r\\n<p>And the host? An insurance salesman, Arif M. Halaby, who I quickly discovered had been the subject of a state cease-and-refrain order earlier in the decade because of certain financial products that an administrative law judge determined that he had sold. The state found that Mr. Halaby was offering \u201cunqualified\u201d securities after an ailing older client pulled equity from his home to invest in a real estate development in Costa Rica. \\r\\n<br>I had long wanted to attend one of these steak dinners, and if you are in or near retirement, or sort the mail of people who are, you might be curious about them as well. Such dinners have been a cause for concern.\\r\\n<br>Almost a decade ago, in \u201cProtecting Older Investors: 2009 Free Lunch Seminar Report,\u201d AARP said 63 percent of the people it had surveyed had received an invitation like the one my aunt found in her mailbox. Among that group, 57 percent had received five or more within the previous three years. The organization figured that 5.9 million people ages 55 or over had attended at least one seminar.\\r\\n<br>AARP\u2019s protective instincts were warranted. Two years earlier, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the North American Securities Administrators Association and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority sent examiners to 110 free-meal seminars. They found that 57 percent of the time, the salespeople used materials that \u201cmay have been misleading or exaggerated or included seemingly unwarranted claims.\u201d \\r\\n<p>I genuinely hoped not to encounter any such thing Tuesday night. But I did.\\r\\n<p>A life-size picture of Mr. Halaby, a former police officer, greeted us on a banner in the foyer of the private dining room. Once we were inside, I saw a large chart on a stand up front. It turned out we were there to learn about equity indexed annuities, a complicated insurance product that I wrote about with a fair bit of skepticism back in 2008.\\r\\n<br>In short (and short is hard when trying to break down products like these), equity indexed annuities tend to work something like this: You hand over a sum of money to an insurance company for a period of time, and at the end you are guaranteed to get at least that much money back if you don't take some money out along the way. You generally don\u2019t get a monthly check, and you agree not to take large amounts out during that period unless you are willing to pay a penalty. As for that equity index part, the insurance company will generally add money to the amount you initially plunked down, providing a portion of the gains reflected in whatever stock index the insurance company is using. \\r\\n<br>Mr. Halaby\u2019s staff distributed material before dinner that included a chart that looked like the one at the front of the room. It showed an equity indexed annuity performing 8.29 percent better, after an 18-year period from 1998 to 2016, than the S&P 500 stock market index.\\r\\n<br>But the pamphlet\u2019s chart has some fine print \u2014 so small that my 47-year-old eyes could barely make it out \u2014 that disclosed the following: The index it was using was not accounting for the reinvestment of dividends from all those stocks.\\r\\n<br>A quick email the next morning to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, confirmed the following: When you do reinvest dividends, that basket of stocks does 33.72 percent better than the annuity.\\r\\n<br>I had hoped to ask our host some questions after the steak, which was cooked medium unwell (no one asked how I wanted it prepared). But by then, Mr. Halaby, who has an active license to sell insurance, including annuities, was gone.\\r\\n<br>I made an appointment to meet him at his office the next morning, and he did not seem happy to see me once I told him who I was. He disparaged my employer and profession and accused me of attending under false pretenses. \\r\\n<p>I explained to him that I wanted to experience the dinner as any invited guest would have. My aunt\u2019s R.S.V.P. used my real name, and Mr. Halaby seems to invite anyone and everyone to attend one of his events via his website, as long as you hand over your name, address, phone number and email. \\r\\n<br>I tried to ask him a long list of questions, starting with a few about that chart. At first, he said he would talk to me if I gave him five references of other people I had written about. (I sent him several names later that day.) Then, he gave me the name of a person he identified as his lawyer and told me to contact her about the chart. (She eventually declined to answer any of my questions.)\\r\\n<br>When I turned my line of inquiry to the cease-and-refrain order, he got up from his chair and said, \u201cWe\u2019re done.\u201d Then he showed me the door.\\r\\n<br>He told me over the phone on Thursday night, after I returned to New York, that he did not deliberately send mail to people over 70 years old and resented what he called the \u201cdog whistle\u201d effect of writing about someone older than that, as if I were trying to imply that he was preying on people well into their older years. I said no one had asked my aunt\u2019s age when she R.S.V.P.\u2019d. Another point I made: I know that mailing list rental firms aren\u2019t perfect \u2014 the 50-something relative whose invitation arrived at my aunt\u2019s hadn\u2019t lived there for 15 years \u2014 but my aunt had also given me an identical invitation that a 76-year-old friend received at his home address. \\r\\n<br>To learn more about the chart in the pamphlet, I contacted the annuity company that created it, American Equity Investment Life Holding Company. \\r\\n<br>I asked Steven D. Schwartz, vice president of investor relations for the company, why the chart doesn\u2019t show the returns for the S&P 500 with reinvested dividends. He said it was because the point of the chart is to show the lack of volatility of an equity indexed annuity compared with the S&P 500.\\r\\n<p>Of course, showing the S&P 500 with reinvested dividends would also do that.\\r\\n<br>In any event, Mr. Schwartz said, Mr. Halaby should not be using that chart, because the company has discontinued the annuity it depicts. \\r\\n<br>\u201cIt is expected that our independent producers will use current materials,\u201d Mr. Schwartz wrote in an email, using industryspeak for salespeople who don\u2019t work directly for the insurance companies. \\r\\n<br>When I asked Mr. Halaby about that, he told me that someone who had not been working for him for very long put the old chart in the pamphlet. He added that the chart behind him at the dinner, which to my eyes looked identical to the one in the pamphlet, was in fact different. He would not tell me what company had created it. \\r\\n<br>American Equity\u2019s updated chart, which it sent me Thursday, shows the S&P 500 \u2014 still with no reinvested dividends \u2014 doing a bit better than a hypothetical indexed annuity for a period starting in 2006 and ending in 2017. To Mr. Halaby\u2019s credit, he made no outsize promises during the dinner. \u201cThe primary thing is not to lose your money,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cMy job is not to make you rich.\u201d It was reasonable, he said, for those in attendance to expect their money to grow 3 to 6 percent annually in an equity indexed annuity. Some people thought it was a compelling pitch; there was a smattering of applause when his presentation ended.\\r\\n<br>Such annuities may be suitable for some risk-averse retirees who are tired of owning stocks. But as I wrote a decade ago, you can probably get better returns during retirement (and not be penalized for taking too much out too soon) by investing mostly in ultrasafe bonds and adding some stock index fund exposure too.\\r\\n<br>There are probably plenty of advisers who sell useful products over a steak dinner. But as my experience here demonstrates, you shouldn\u2019t show up for one without doing a couple of things. First, conduct a quick online search about the host, including a check of the central database for stockbrokers\u2019 black marks and the similar ones that state insurance departments maintain. Mr. Halaby\u2019s run-in with the state is right there on the first page of his Google search results.\\r\\n<br>Then, read any and all fine print, even if it requires a magnifying glass. Ask lots of questions. AARP published a good list several years ago, though I\u2019d add another one: Why aren\u2019t referrals from happy customers alone enough to keep you in business? \\r\\n<p>If you\u2019re still intrigued by a particular product or pitch, don\u2019t move any money right away.

Brick and mortar never had it so rough.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>I have a faint memory of an article I read some years back detailing the grim life of a shelf picker in an Amazon warehouse. It described the arrangement of products on shelves \u2014 unlikely juxtapositions determined wholly by algorithm. \\r\\n<br>A worker\u2019s life was disorienting; you never knew where anything might be. Nail clippers might be next to stone humidifiers or HVAC filters or picture frames. The worker was given a product location and ran to it. Then another. And again. The warehouse was a game, the products little more than flippers in search of a pinball to thwack.\\r\\n<br>This holiday season, you are the pinball.\\r\\n<br>Amazon has recently opened Amazon 4-Star, a catchall gift shop in SoHo \u2014 about 100 feet from Balthazar and the MoMA Design Store \u2014 that\u2019s part of the company\u2019s slow seep into physical retail. It is grim. A permanent store with the harried, colorless mood of a hastily assembled clearance-sale pop-up. Lot-Less Closeouts stores have more vim and charm.\\r\\n<p>Amazon 4-Star asks what would happen if the logic of the warehouse writ raw was applied to a traditional storefront. Who needs a warehouse picker when the customers can do the work themselves?\\r\\n<p>Spending time browsing here was among my most dismal shopping experiences in recent memory: joyless, arbitrary, spiritually empty. And that was before a 20-something guy bounded into the store and started screaming: \u201cAlexa! Alexa! Alexa!\u201d\\r\\n<br>Some of the items Amazon 4-Star hawks are Amazon products, naturally: the Amazon Echo home assistant (which ordinarily answers to \u201cAlexa\u201d), the Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet, the Amazon Fire TV Stick, plenty of AmazonBasics items, including a five-way headphone splitter ($9.49, $8.07 for Prime; 4.4 rating). Run-of-the-mill vertical integration stuff. Not my ecosystem, but fine.\\r\\n<br>Some sections are arranged logically: children\u2019s toys, kitchen items, smart-home tools. (I use \u201csection\u201d very loosely. On the wall, each one is perhaps a couple of feet wide.) And each item tag has a price, a lower price for Amazon Prime members (sometimes) and an average star rating (along with the number of customers who rated it).\\r\\n<p>About that 4-Star name, though. Thing is, I know there\u2019s a fifth star. Four stars out of five is already a concession. What\u2019s on offer aren\u2019t the most premium products, but rather ones that are pretty good. \\r\\n<br>Add to that the fact that I found several items in the store that actually have a rating below four stars. Say, the iRobot Braava Jet 240 wet mop ($199\/$169; 3.8), or Don\u2019t Lose Your Cool, ($19.99\/$10.42; 2.4), a party game that includes a contraption you strap to your head that measures rises in heart rate and which presumably was tested on customers shopping here.\\r\\n<br>You trust a store because you trust how it was curated. That\u2019s true whether it\u2019s Walmart or Dover Street Market. But there is little oversight here beyond the Amazon imprimatur. In several places, products are arranged by theme. Again, I use \u201ctheme\u201d loosely: \u201cTop Selling Around NYC,\u201d \u201cMost Wished for Books on Amazon.\u201d\\r\\n<br>\u201cTrending Around NYC on Amazon.com.\u201d Taxonomies I have never pondered and which are utterly useless.\\r\\n<p>On the Trending table, a Lego advent calendar ($29.99; 4.7) was next to a Panasonic Arc 5 electric razor ($199.99\/$99.99; 4.5), which was next to a tub of CeraVe moisturizing cream ($15.06; 4.6) and just inches from Michelle Obama\u2019s memoir, \u201cBecoming\u201d ($32.50\/$19.50; 4.8). \\r\\n<br>A couple of tables away, a Big Gulp-size Yankee Candle in a surprisingly not acrid Christmas Cookie scent ($17.99; 4.1) was next to \u201cLess,\u201d a novel by Andrew Sean Greer that won the Pulitzer Prize ($15.99\/$10.87; 3.7).\\r\\n<p>These are chaotic arrangements, on tables set among floor paths that resemble a field maze. Decoration and filigree is minimal. There were a couple of afterthought cardboard trees on the electronic gift guide table, but not much beyond that. Almost every 10 minutes, a UPS handler would roll in a hand truck filled with those signature Amazon boxes, presumably loading up the store with inventory.\\r\\n<br>Now look, I rely on Amazon Prime just like the next hypocrite, and I understand how one\u2019s needs aren\u2019t cleanly categorizable. But this store treats commerce like a tornado. On one table, there was a tossed-together collection of light winter jackets less organized than what you\u2019d find in the Times Square H&M; underneath the table was a set of cardboard boxes with sizes written in marker on the side. Forget farm-to-table; this is pallet-to-checkout.\\r\\n<p>Maybe I was using the wrong approach \u2014 absorbing the store as a whole, and not like a warehouse picker in search of a specific item. So I went through my mental inventory of home problems that need solving. \\r\\n<br>Inspired by a friend\u2019s recent purchase of a 75-inch television (insert drool emoji), I sought out the electronics section. But there was only one option, a meager 55 inches. There was an impressive-looking Sonos Beam Soundbar ($399\/$349; 4.1), but that felt like something to address later, once the main itch had been scratched.\\r\\n<br>Then, a manageable ask. Over Thanksgiving weekend, my mother gave serious side eye to the pan I use to make eggs, which after years of use resembles something extracted from a barn on \u201cAmerican Pickers.\u201d Easy enough. I went to the kitchen section but found that there were none. \\r\\n<br>Well, strictly speaking, there was one: a tree-ornament version, the 3.5-inch Lodge miniature skillet ($6.25\/$4.69; 4.4), good for a single egg or a quick wallop on the head, which, by this point, would have been sweet relief.\\r\\n<br>Amazon 4-Star 72 Spring Street, 212-966-2462; amazon.com\/4-star\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"technology.11.txt\",\"id\":400461459},{\"title\":\"In a Divided Bosnia, Segregated Schools Persist\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"Ethnic tensions are worsening in Bosnia two decades after a bloody, bitter war.

The ethnic Croatians from the suburbs are taught in the right side of the building. They are mostly Roman Catholics. The Bosnian Muslim students who live mostly in the city are taught in the left side.\\r\\n<br>For many of the students, the split is an unwanted relic of Bosnia\u2019s ethnic wars of the 1990s among Serbs, Croats and Muslims.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThey don\u2019t want us to socialize in school,\u201d said Iman Maslic, 18, a Muslim student, \u201dso we go to cafes after class and hang out together there.\u201d\\r\\n<p>But unwanted or not, the divide is deepening in a Bosnia where nationalist politicians are again stoking ethnic rivalries.\\r\\n<p>The school in Travnik, an ancient capital of the Ottoman province in the Balkans, is emblematic of a part of the country\u2019s education system known as \u201cTwo Schools Under One Roof.\u201d It was built in the late 19th century, when Bosnia was an outpost of the Austro-Hungarian empire.\\r\\n<br>The Roman Catholic Church owns the building today and operates the school and seminary on the right side. On the left is the state-run high school that controlled the building during the Communist era in the former Yugoslavia.\\r\\n<br>The church wants to evict the state school, but the two sides \u2014 the Croats and predominantly Muslim Bosniaks \u2014 remain entwined by the legacy of the Dayton Accords, the American-led treaty that ended the war.\\r\\n<p>The treaty brought peace but, in doing so, effectively engraved ethnic and religious divisions by carving out turf for the Serbs, Croats and Bosnian Muslims. And these divisions are often most evident in the segregated schools, a system that critics warn risks perpetuating the ingrained animosities in the broader society.\\r\\n<br>In recent years, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe that oversees education in Bosnia has pushed to discard the system of segregated education, warning that \u201cethnically oriented curricula\u201d impede reconciliation, perpetuate divisions, \u201climit economic development and jeopardize the long-term stability and security.\u201d\\r\\n<br>In one school in the central city of Jajce, students successfully rebelled, demanding to be allowed to study together after a local minister wanted to separate Muslim students from their Croatian classmates.\\r\\n<p>But the system remains.\\r\\n<br>There are at least 50 schools around Bosnia in which students of different ethnicities are separated within the same building and studying on different floors, in different shifts or on different sides of the same building. An entire generation is growing up learning history, literature, art, music, math and science from textbooks designed by law especially for ethnic groups.\\r\\n<br>In Bosnian politics, nationalist figures silently condone segregated education, but some young politicians \u2014 including many who graduated from the segregated system \u2014 are calling to abolish the system.\\r\\n<br>\u201cWe do not want to send our kids to Two Schools Under One Roof,\u201d Lana Prlic, 25, a member of Bosnia\u2019s Social Democrat Party, said on her Twitter account during a recent election campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are fighting for a COUNTRY FOR ALL OF US.\u201d Born during the war to a Croat father and a Bosniak mother, she graduated from the segregated high school in the city of Mostar.\\r\\n<p>Disunion is codified in Bosnia, which since the war\u2019s end has been divided between a Serbian autonomous region and a Muslim-Croat federation. Governance structures are immensely complicated, with the office of the presidency divided into three elected positions, one each for Bosnian Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks. National elections in October saw angry appeals for ethnic loyalty.\\r\\n<br>Croat nationalists are especially resistant to changing this divided system, largely because establishing multiethnic, state-run schools would be an obstacle to carving out a Croat-only autonomous region in Bosnia, akin to what the Serbs have achieved in the war through brutal campaigns of expulsions and mass killings of non-Serb population. The Croats did not achieve that in the war, but nationalists have been pursuing it ever since peace took hold.\\r\\n<br>\u201cSince the end of the war, the hard-line nationalists \u2014 fighting for a Croat ethnic identity and its own mini state in Bosnia \u2014 have turned the school into a battlefield,\u201d said Adisa Busuladzic, a political analyst and a writer in Mostar.\\r\\n<p>The school in Travnik, a town 56 miles west of the capital, Sarajevo, embodies the divided country.\\r\\n<br>The right side for Croat students has been newly refurbished and painted blue by the Catholic Church. The left side for all other students has been left with chipped bricks and peeling yellow paint. Classes are staggered, with a half-hour gap between the two sides, to prevent students from socializing during breaks.\\r\\n<br>Then there\u2019s the sprawling, indoor gym that only the Croat students use, while all those in the state school attend gym classes in the nearby park, including during hot summers and cold winters.\\r\\n<br>As the president of Bosnia\u2019s Association of High School Students, Ms. Maslic regularly talks with students from all over the country about how to overcome institutionalized segregation, short of quitting school. To get an education, she said, many students have developed lives parallel to the ethnically divided reality.\\r\\n<p>\u201cWe are separated on paper, not in real life,\u201d Ms. Maslic said.\\r\\n<br>Language is also a barrier, if a seemingly artificial one.\\r\\n<br>Like the territory of Bosnia, its common tongue \u2014 a Slavic language that was once known as Serbo-Croatian \u2014 was divided into three in the Dayton accords. Serbian stands apart because of the Cyrillic alphabet. But when spoken, Bosnia\u2019s three official languages sound similar, if largely distinguished by regional dialects.\\r\\n<br>\u201cHonestly, there\u2019s really not much difference in how we speak,\u201d said Gabriela Zlatunic, an 18-year-old student who identified herself as an ethnic Croat during an interview at the segregated school in Travnik.\\r\\n<p>\u201cWe understand each other, and there are no differences between us outside of the school,\u201d Ms. Zlatunic said.\\r\\n<br>Segregated schools first sprung up after the fighting ceased in 1995 in Mostar, a divided town on the Neretva River that Croats want as the capital of their own region. During the war, Croats drove Muslims from their homes on the west bank of the Neretva and blew up bridges behind them.\\r\\n<br>Today, Mostar\u2019s elite high school sits on the former front line. Students from both sides of the town attend classes on the first two floors, sharing some classrooms and the chemistry and biology labs \u2014 although they never attend classes with members of the other ethnic group.\\r\\n<p>The third floor is occupied by an integrated international school with students from across Bosnia.\\r\\n<br>\u201cIt\u2019s segregated schooling in the floors below us,\u201d said Mark Feltham, the head teacher of the United World Collage, during a recent interview in Mostar. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously not ideal,\u201d Mr. Feltham said, but cautioned against legislating against it entirely because Mostar, Bosnia\u2019s fourth-largest city, is still reeling from the war.\\r\\n<br>\u201cIt is happening in the context in which we are still sifting through the considerable emotional debris of the war that finished 20 years plus ago,\u201d Mr. Feltham said.\\r\\n<br>Back in Travnik, students said they were exhausted by the burdens of a war they neither fought nor lived. They want to move on, \u201cremove the metal fences and the obstacles erected in our own heads,\u201d said Arsam Gasi, an ethnic Albanian, who attends the state side of school. He plays soccer with Croats and celebrates Ramadan with Muslims and Christmas, twice, with Christian Orthodox and Catholics.\\r\\n<p>\u201cNobody ever asks which side your family was on in that war,\u201d Mr. Gasi said. \u201cWe can share the town; why can\u2019t we be in the same school?\u201d\\r\\n<br>The director of the state side of the school, Aida Loncar, has asked her Croatian counterparts on the right side of the building to tear down the metal fence dividing the schoolyard.\\r\\n<br>\u201cWe can replace it with flower pots,\u201d Ms. Loncar said. \u201cIt\u2019s still a barrier they want, but at least it\u2019s alive, and like all living beings, it needs tending. We could work on it together.\u201d\\r\\n<p>Ivana Curic, the director of the Catholic School Center, said the fence was needed to ensure the security of small children and because the two schools were \u201ctwo entirely different institutions.\u201d\\r\\n<br>\u201cIt does not look pretty, we are aware of that,\u201d Ms. Curic said. \u201cBut it\u2019s there, and that\u2019s just that.\u201d\\r\\n<br>During a recent visit to the school, students on the Croatian side of the yard were playing football.

His role was to preach the gospel. The others were supposed to be physically aggressive. Some came at him with fake spears, speaking gibberish.\\r\\n<br>It was part of an intensive and somewhat secretive three-week missionary training camp. Mary Ho, the international executive leader for All Nations, the organization that ran the training, said, \u201cJohn was one of the best participants in this experience that we have ever had.\u201d\\r\\n<br>For Mr. Chau, 26, the boot camp was the culmination of years of meticulous planning that involved linguistics training and studying to become an emergency medical technician, as well as forgoing full-time jobs so he could travel and toughen himself up.\\r\\n<p>He did it all with the single-minded goal of breaking through to the people of North Sentinel Island, a remote outpost of hunters and gatherers in the Andaman Sea who had shown tremendous hostility to outsiders.\\r\\n<br>It was an obsession. Ever since Mr. Chau had learned in high school through a missionary website, the Joshua Project, that the North Sentinel people were perhaps the most isolated in the world, he was hooked. Much of what he did the rest of his short life was directed toward this mission.\\r\\n<br>He would pull up Google Maps and point to a green speck in a place no one had ever heard of \u2014 the Andaman Islands, far off the coast of India \u2014 and tell his friends with a buoyant smile: \u201cI\u2019m going there.\u201d\\r\\n<br>In the 21st century, it is a marvel that a place like North Sentinel even exists.\\r\\n<br>A tropical island, it is home to a few dozen people living a lifestyle thousands of years old and speaking a language no outsiders understand. Visitors have been driven back and killed by islanders armed with bows and arrows. Mr. Chau knew this.\\r\\n<p>A review of hundreds of pages of his journals and blog postings, as well as interviews with two dozen people from around the world \u2014 fellow missionaries, family members and relatives of fishermen in the Andaman Islands \u2014 reveal a portrait of a joyful adventurer with a zest for life who resisted all warnings, despite being told repeatedly he might be killed.\\r\\n<br>\u201cMy folks tried to talk him out of it,\u2019\u2019 said John Ramsey, a friend. \u201cHe said it was what he felt called to do, and he was pretty made up in his mind already so it didn\u2019t seem like persuasion would do a lot of good anyway.\u201d\\r\\n<br>As he prepared for the mission, Mr. Chau stepped up his exercise routine, doing push-ups, jogging and being careful what he ate.\\r\\n<br>Friends said he did not expect to die and had taken all precautions he could think of to survive, including packing what he called an \u201cinitial contact response kit\u201d with dental forceps to remove arrows.\\r\\n<p>Many of his friends admitted they knew the mission was extremely dangerous \u2014 and illegal because for years the Indian government has prohibited outsiders from visiting the island.\\r\\n<br>But they also said they were in awe of what he was trying to do, seeing Mr. Chau as a pure expression of their faith.\\r\\n<p>His mission failed. After landing on North Sentinel in mid-November wearing only black underpants \u2014 Mr. Chau thought that would make the islanders feel more comfortable \u2014 he struggled to communicate.\\r\\n<br>The islanders were aggressive, as they have been with just about everyone else who had tried to make contact with them.\\r\\n<br>They shouted at him. They shot arrows. Then they killed him.\\r\\n<br>His body is still on the beach. Indian police officers are afraid to retrieve it, lest they increase the hostilities.\\r\\n<br>His friends mourn the loss of someone they describe as a real character: good looking but perennially single, always exploring, even landing a beef jerky sponsorship that gave him all the free jerky he could eat for his travels.\\r\\n<p>But many fellow Christians, including some of his friends, are uncomfortable with what he did.\\r\\n<br>\u201cHe was caught up in a dangerous set of ideologies that helped drive him to do something so unwise,\u201d said Kaleb Graves, a student pastor in Arkansas who befriended Mr. Chau at a linguistics institute last year.\\r\\n<br>\u201cHe should have known better.\u201d\\r\\n<h2>Missionary Work: A Perfect Fit\\r\\n<br>Mr. Chau grew up in Vancouver in Washington State, not far from Portland, Ore. The youngest of three children, he is the son of an American mother, who is a lawyer, and a Chinese father, a psychiatrist.\\r\\n<p>He is of the generation that has put his entire life \u2014 even before it actually started \u2014 online, including pictures of his young father during Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution. His father, Patrick, said he disagreed with his son about many religious matters and did not want him going to North Sentinel but was \u201cin the dark most of the time\u201d about what his son was doing.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Chau attended a Christian high school and then Oral Roberts University, a fundamentalist Christian school, where people remembered how positive and open he was.\\r\\n<br>\u201cHaving a conversation with John was like having a conversation with someone who reached out their hand and put it on your heart to feel the way it beats,\u201d said Nicole Hopkins, a college friend.\\r\\n<br>\u201cWhen he looked at me, it was like someone really saw me,\u201d she said, \u201clike I could take off any mask of who I pretended to be.\u201d\\r\\n<p>His heroes were the naturalist John Muir and Jim Elliot, an American evangelical missionary killed in Ecuador, and friends said missionary work was the perfect fit.\\r\\n<br>It united his two interests: traveling to far-flung places and serving God.\\r\\n<h2>\u2018Well Aware of the Dangers\u2019\\r\\n<br>In the Book of Matthew, the resurrected Jesus says: \u201cGo and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.\u201d\\r\\n<p>This passage is known as the Great Commission, and several of Mr. Chau\u2019s friends said that more than anything else, it explained why Mr. Chau did what he did.\\r\\n<br>In the past few decades, mission work has soared. The number of American Christian missionaries going overseas has increased to around 130,000 today, from 57,000 in 1970, said Gina A. Zurlo, a research fellow at the Institute on Culture, Religion and World Affairs in Boston.\\r\\n<br>The reasons, scholars say, are the rise of evangelicalism; an increase in the number of independent churches organizing their own missions; and the ease of travel.\\r\\n<br>After college, Mr. Chau hit the road. He took temporary jobs \u2014 soccer coach, wilderness guide, AmeriCorps \u2014 so he could hike, mountain climb, kayak and scuba dive, blogging all the way.\\r\\n<p>He also learned first aid and became an E.M.T.\\r\\n<br>In 2015, he made his first of four trips to the Andaman Island chain, basing himself in Port Blair, the main city.\\r\\n<br>The men at the hotel where he usually stayed said he was friendly and always requested the same room: 121, a small single with a good view.\\r\\n<p>Preparations for his trip to North Sentinel picked up last year. He completed a summer course at the Canada Institute of Linguistics, in British Columbia, where he hunkered down in a dorm room stacked with books and jars of peanut butter, immersing himself in phonology and phonetics.\\r\\n<br>He was determined to translate the Bible into the language that the people on North Sentinel speak, which has stumped anthropologists who say it is unintelligible even to people who live on nearby islands.\\r\\n<br>He told his friends that he wanted to immerse himself in the culture and stay for years.\\r\\n<br>He also reassured them he would take it slow, leaving gifts for the islanders and waiting for them to open up to him before he approached.\\r\\n<br>While he was preparing for his mission, Mr. Chau struck up a relationship with Perky Jerky, a company that gives away its product to \u201cmicro influencers.\u201d In exchange for free jerky, Mr. Chau agreed to promote Perky Jerky on social media.\\r\\n<p>He often had the boxes of Perky Jerky sent to his friend, Mr. Ramsey, whose family lived about an hour away from the linguistics school. He and Mr. Ramsey had met during a summer trip to Israel for Christian students.\\r\\n<br>While Mr. Chau did not broadcast his North Sentinel plans on social media, he revealed them to the Ramsey family.\\r\\n<p>\u201cHe was well aware of the dangers and the fact that it was not exactly legal,\u201d Mr. Ramsey said.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Ramsey\u2019s mother, who initially had misgivings, was won over and helped edit Mr. Chau\u2019s application for missionary boot camp.\\r\\n<h2>An Isolated People\\r\\n<br>In a world where just about every mile is mapped, North Sentinel remains an enigma. The people there have resisted contact from outsiders for as long as there are records.\\r\\n<br>In 1880, a 19-year-old British naval officer impetuously kidnapped several islanders and brought them back to Port Blair. Some soon died and later the officer wondered if this episode had increased the islanders\u2019 hostility.\\r\\n<br>Around this time, the British, who were the imperial power in the region, began building up Port Blair, home to a large prison.\\r\\n<p>Vishvajit Pandya, an Indian anthropologist, said the people on North Sentinel used to trade with other islanders and possibly intermarry with them, but the British expansion disrupted those ties, isolating North Sentinel.\\r\\n<br>The population of the island has now fallen to 50 to 100, which anthropologists say could be a threat to survival.\\r\\n<p>From what anthropologists surmise, the islanders are related to other Andaman ethnic groups. All are believed to have migrated from Africa tens of thousands of years ago.\\r\\n<br>The people on North Sentinel eat fish and turtles, wear bark belts around their waists and carry long bows to fire arrows. They have killed several outsiders, including fishermen, who have stepped on their beach.\\r\\n<br>Nevertheless, Mr. Chau was determined to go there alone.\\r\\n<br>He thought his size would make him less threatening, Mr. Ramsey said. Mr. Chau was about 5\u20196,\u201d 130 pounds.\\r\\n<br>In October 2017, Mr. Chau began his missionary training at All Nations\u2019 headquarters in Kansas City, Mo. He attended lectures, spoke with anthropologists and participated in the village simulation exercise.\\r\\n<p>That exercise, said Mrs. Ho of All Nations, was \u201cdesigned to reflect an amalgamation of many different aspects of language and culture that a missionary might encounter on the field.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Mr. Chau performed impressively, she said. Still, there were concerns.\\r\\n<br>His planned trip to North Sentinel had no precedent. And missionaries usually travel in teams. Others were willing to go with him, Mrs. Ho said, but he refused, saying it was too dangerous.\\r\\n<p><h2>Making Contact\\r\\n<br>Mr. Chau landed in Port Blair on Oct. 16, traveled to another island in the Andamans and then returned to Port Blair.\\r\\n<br>There, he holed up for 11 days in a small apartment that he referred to as a \u201csafe house\u201d in a long note that the police found after his death. He wrote that he never saw sunlight that whole time.\\r\\n<p>The police say he was doing this to avoid being spotted; his friends say he was trying to prevent himself from getting sick to protect the islanders, whose immune systems have been isolated so long that some experts say they could be wiped out by the common cold.\\r\\n<br>With the help of a local evangelical, Mr. Chau hired five fishermen. Their boat was a battered wooden craft about 30 feet long, with a roof made of bamboo sticks and a plastic tarp. They chugged out the night of Nov. 14.\\r\\n<p>When they reached North Sentinel in the morning, Mr. Chau assembled a collapsible kayak because the fishermen refused to go to the island with him, insisting on staying a half mile out.\\r\\n<p>Mr. Chau saw some islanders on the beach, paddled up to them and tried to preach, saying: \u201cMy name is John, I love you and Jesus loves you,\u201d according to the note. They raised their bows and he paddled back to the fishing boat.\\r\\n<br>A few hours later, he tried walking onto the beach with some gifts like scissors and safety pins.\\r\\n<br>A boy shot an arrow into a waterproof Bible he was carrying.\\r\\n<br>Another islander, a man wearing a crown possibly made of flowers, stood on a coral rock and yelled at him.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Pandya, one of the few anthropologists to have set foot on North Sentinel, said these were clear warnings.\\r\\n<br>The islanders, he said, were saying: \u201cI don\u2019t want to engage with you, go away.\u201d\\r\\n<br>\u201cIf they were so savage,\u201d Mr. Pandya said, \u201cthey would have slaughtered him straight away.\u201d\\r\\n<p>The islanders chased Mr. Chau into the surf. He saw the fishermen far away, standing in the boat, waving their arms up and down, and swam to them.\\r\\n<p>The last part of the note conveys fear. He wrote, \u201cIt almost seems like certain death to stay here.\u201d\\r\\n<br>But the next morning he insisted on sending the fishing boat away, saying in the letter he had met someone in South Africa who went through a similar experience on a different island in the Andamans and won the trust of islanders only after being dropped off by a boat.\\r\\n<br>He seemed now to be contemplating the end, writing in the note, \u201cRemember, the first one to heaven wins.\u201d\\r\\n<br>The fishermen told the police the next morning that Mr. Chau swam to the island. They then went to the ocean to fish.\\r\\n<br>When they returned to North Sentinel a day later to check on him, they saw a group of islanders on the beach dragging Mr. Chau\u2019s body with a rope.\\r\\n<br>All five fishermen have been arrested, along with two others, accused of helping lead Mr. Chau to his death.\\r\\n<br>\u201cI am frustrated hearing John\u2019s name,\u201d said Naw Halen, the wife of one of the fishermen. \u201cHe has filled my family with sorrow for our whole life.\u201d\\r\\n<p>In American missionary circles, his death hit like a shock wave.\\r\\n<br>\u201cI don\u2019t question his motivation, I question his methods,\u201d said Richard Albert Mohler Jr., the president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky.\\r\\n<br>Members of the Ramsey family gathered in their living room, read through Mr. Chau\u2019s last letter and cried.\\r\\n<br>But they said they did not feel guilty.\\r\\n<br>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Ramsey said. \u201cHe had a higher calling that he was following.

Scammers in India May Be Behind It\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"The police outside New Delhi raided fake tech-support centers that sent false warnings to Americans and Canadians and then charged to \u201cfix\u201d the nonexistent infection.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>MUMBAI, India \u2014 You know the messages. They pop up on your computer screen with ominous warnings like, \u201cYour computer has been infected with a virus. Call our toll-free number immediately for help.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Often they look like alerts from Microsoft, Apple or Symantec. Sometimes the warning comes in a phone call.\\r\\n<br>Most people ignore these entreaties, which are invariably scams. But one in five recipients actually talks to the fake tech-support centers, and 6 percent ultimately pay the operators to \u201cfix\u201d the nonexistent problem, according to recent consumer surveys by Microsoft.\\r\\n<br>Law enforcement authorities, working with Microsoft, have now traced many of these boiler rooms to New Delhi, India\u2019s capital and a hub of the global call-center industry. On Tuesday and Wednesday, police from two Delhi suburbs raided 16 fake tech-support centers and arrested about three dozen people. Last month, the Delhi authorities arrested 24 people in similar raids on 10 call centers.\\r\\n<p>In Gautam Budh Nagar, one of the suburbs, 50 police officers swept into eight centers on Tuesday night. Ajay Pal Sharma, the senior superintendent of police there, said the scammers had extracted money from thousands of victims, most of whom were American or Canadian.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThe modus operandi was to send a pop-up on people\u2019s systems using a fake Microsoft logo,\u201d Mr. Sharma said. After the victims contacted the call center, the operator, pretending to be a Microsoft employee, would tell them that their system had been hacked or attacked by a virus. The victims would then be offered a package of services ranging from $99 to $1,000 to fix the problem, he said.\\r\\n<br>Such scams are widespread, said Courtney Gregoire, an assistant general counsel in Microsoft\u2019s digital crimes unit.\\r\\n<br>Microsoft, whose Windows software runs most personal computers, gets 11,000 or so complaints about the scams every month, she said, and its internet monitors spot about 150,000 pop-up ads for the services every day. The company\u2019s own tech-support forums, where people can publicly post items, also see a steady stream of posts offering fake tech-support services.\\r\\n<br>Although American authorities have busted such scams in places like Florida and Ohio, the backbone of the illicit industry is in India \u2014 in large part because of the country\u2019s experience running so many of the world\u2019s call centers. India\u2019s outsourcing industry, which includes call centers, generates about $28 billion in annual revenue and employs about 1.2 million people.\\r\\n<p>\u201cThe success of the legitimate industry has made it easier for the illegitimate industry there,\u201d Ms. Gregoire said. As in any con, experience helps. \u201cYou have to convince them they have a problem,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to have the touch.\u201d\\r\\n<br>For tech companies, combating the impersonators is complicated by the fact that many legitimate tech-support operations, including some of Microsoft\u2019s, operate from India.\\r\\n<br>The scam is quite lucrative. Researchers at Stony Brook University, who published a detailed study of fake tech-support services last year, estimated that a single pop-up campaign spread over 142 web domains brought in nearly $10 million in just two months.\\r\\n<br>Najmeh Miramirkhani, lead author of the research paper, said the network of entities involved in the scams was complex, with some making their own calls and others running the sites but outsourcing the calls to India. Many of the scammers also share data with one another.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThis is an organized crime,\u201d she said.\\r\\n<br>Microsoft said it was working with other tech industry leaders such as Apple and Google, as well as law enforcement, to fight the scourge, which is migrating beyond the English-speaking world to target other users in their local languages. In the 16 countries surveyed by Microsoft, people in India and China were the most likely to pay the con artists.\\r\\n<br>The problem extends beyond fake tech support, too. In July, the Justice Department said 24 people in eight states had been convicted for their roles in a scheme to use Indian call-center agents to impersonate tax collectors at the Internal Revenue Service. The thieves duped more than 15,000 people out of hundreds of millions of dollars. Thirty-two contractors in India were also indicted.\\r\\n<p>Mr. Sharma said that in a similar con broken up by his department, call-center agents had impersonated Canadian tax authorities.\\r\\n<br>Like the I.R.S., Microsoft and other legitimate technology companies do not call their users out of the blue. Nor do they send security alerts to the screen telling customers to call them.\\r\\n<br>Ms. Miramirkhani had some simple advice to avoid being conned: Don\u2019t pick up the phone.\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"technology.12.txt\",\"id\":-592673859},{\"title\":\"Tech Fix: Make Your Friends and Family Less Irksome This Holiday Season\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"Getting a big group together this time of year can be a hassle. So spare everyone the endless phone notifications and email threads and try these methods instead.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>With the holiday season upon us, our phones will soon explode with messages and calls from friends and family hoping to catch up and make plans.\\r\\n<br>As heartwarming as that sounds, the simple task of coordinating a group feels acutely painful this time of year, especially when people with widely varying levels of digital literacy all rely on the same tech to congregate.\\r\\n<br>Everyone is familiar with the endless email threads scattered with replies from people saying when they are available, where they would like to meet and what they would like to do \u2014 with no one seeming to agree on anything. Same goes for the big group text message and that one relative who floods our phones with multiple consecutive texts to convey a single thought. (You know who you are.)\\r\\n<br>And here we thought technology was supposed to make our lives more efficient. \\r\\n<br>Fret not. I share your pain and so tested various tools to help people get together and stay connected this holiday. Here were the best ones.\\r\\n<p><h2>For Making Plans\\r\\n<br>Let\u2019s start with the most frustrating situation: getting a big group of people to agree on when and where to meet. There are plenty of approaches, like sharing calendars or sending lots of emails, but the simplest solution I\u2019ve found is creating a poll.\\r\\n<br>DoodlePoll, or doodle.com, is a free web tool made just for this purpose. First, you create a poll and give it a title, like \u201cWatch the Fantastic Beasts movie.\u201d In the following steps, you can select multiple potential times and dates, such as 7 p.m. on Dec. 23, 3 p.m. on Dec. 25 and 4 p.m. on Dec. 26.\\r\\n<br>After you make your selections, you punch in your name and get a web link that people can click on to view the options, cast their votes and type in their name. From there, you can choose the time slot that got the most votes, close the poll and then communicate the plan to the group. I\u2019ve used this tool for groups big and small, and it spares me dozens of notifications and messages before meeting up.\\r\\n<h2>For a Group Chat\\r\\n<br>When it comes to staying in touch or catching up over the holidays, using a group text message is fine if everyone is using an iPhone. That\u2019s because Apple\u2019s default texting service, iMessage, gives you the option to leave the conversation when it becomes too distracting. \\r\\n<br>But if there are Android users among the group, the chat bubbles turn from blue to green, meaning that the messages are being sent as traditional text messages. Unfortunately, with traditional texting you can\u2019t exit a group chat, and the only option is to turn off alerts for the entire conversation.\\r\\n<p>It\u2019s a better idea to start a group conversation with a messaging app that works for both Apple and Android devices. WhatsApp, Signal and Facebook Messenger are all good options: Each offers the ability to leave a group conversation. My favorite is WhatsApp because it tends to be the app that most people already have installed; it also lets you share your location to make it easier for people to find you.\\r\\n<br>Some families or friends will want some face-to-face interaction from afar. The popular tools are video-chatting apps like Apple\u2019s FaceTime for iPhone users or Google Hangouts for Android or iPhone. Hangouts has supported group video chats for years, and FaceTime added the option just last month to make a group call with up to 32 people.\\r\\n<h2>For Sharing Photos\\r\\n<p>Then there\u2019s the annual exchange of photos during the holidays. You could just send a dozen photos of your trip to Europe or your newborn in a group text message, but that would burn through everyone\u2019s cellular data plans and make you unpopular.\\r\\n<br>There are better solutions (as I detailed in a guide last year). Google Photos is an excellent app for both Android devices and iPhones. Whenever you take a photo, Google Photos backs it up in the cloud, which makes it easier to share with others who have Google accounts. It also has neat tools to automatically organize photos into albums \u2014 for example, the app can use location data to create an album for your vacation in Spain.\\r\\n<br>For families that exclusively use iPhones, AirDrop is a good option to share photos among devices easily. When you are next to a relative, you can select a photo or a group of photos on your iPhone and tap the Share button (a box with an arrow pointing up). Your relative\u2019s device will show up under the AirDrop menu, and you can select the device. The files will move over instantly \u2014 even a batch of 50 photos will take less than a minute.\\r\\n<br>These methods aren't completely hassle-free, of course. Some of them require goading less tech-savvy friends and relatives into trying new tools. But once they are persuaded, your holiday gatherings will be less vexing to create, organize and reminisce about for years to come.\\r\\n<p>\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"technology.14.txt\",\"id\":1700442999},{\"title\":\"Virgos Are Queen of Teen Internet\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"Insights from Tumblr and others suggest that people really are obsessed with astrology (again) \u2014 and not just the memes.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>There\u2019s evidence that, in 2018, people online started to take astrology more seriously.\\r\\n<br>You may have had a hunch that this was a thing, but the shift was evident on Tumblr, historically the source of many of the best astrology jokes and memes, like this post assessing the sun signs of a group of big chef dolls.\\r\\n<br>These days, the astrology humor is less of a presence on the platform. Amanda Brennan, Tumblr\u2019s trends expert, said that many users had stopped joking about astrology, part of a broader shift away from memes that she has observed in popular culture.\\r\\n<br>\u201cWhen it comes to figuring out your identity on a larger scale, I think people are moving toward, \u2018I don\u2019t want to be funny about this anymore,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018I want to be more serious about what my identity means.\u2019\u201d\\r\\n<br>Tumblr has taken a cue from its users and included the study of the stars in its annual year-end rankings. The site uses the number of searches, posts and reblogs within popular subject areas on Tumblr to name the year\u2019s most talked-about topics. On a platform built for people to obsess over things, the lists are a key to what people obsessed over most.\\r\\n<p>This comes in a big year overall in the socio-celestial media space. Co-Star, an astrology app that delivers daily readings and insight into users\u2019 compatibility, said it gained 1.3 million users. Instagram and Twitter accounts focused on the cosmos saw their followings surge.\\r\\n<br>As with all crazes, astrology has its zealots. For the past decade, the humorless people of the world were the ones most likely to spoil the fun by pointing out that astrology isn\u2019t real. Now it\u2019s those humorless people who may start to take their star charts Extremely Seriously.\\r\\n<br>Courtney Perkins, who started the Instagram account @notallgeminis early this year, said that her relationship with astrology was mostly lighthearted. She said that most of her followers shared that attitude, but that there were exceptions.\\r\\n<br>\u201cI think the thing that people take most seriously is compatibility,\u201d Ms. Perkins said. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing that I get the most questions about so far: \u2018Will I work with this person?\u2019 I think astrology is a really fun tool for talking about yourself in an era where none of us can afford therapy. But when people start to rule out romantic prospects or evaluate their friendships based on star signs, I feel like that can be a slippery slope.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Earlier this month, Ms. Perkins, Ms. Brennan and Banu Guler, the chief-executive of Co-Star, talked about the four signs that showed up at the top of Tumblr\u2019s list \u2014 and the sign that went least-discussed this year. \\r\\n<p><h2>1. Virgo\\r\\n<br>Everyone on Tumblr stans a Virgo \u2014 possibly because many people on Tumblr were born between late August and late September. (September is the busiest month for birthdays in the past two decades.)\\r\\n<br>Virgos are \u201calso people who are very sensitive and emotional, which kind of aligns with Tumblr,\u201d Ms. Brennan said. \u201cThey\u2019re people who are extremely connected online and people who might want to use social media because they\u2019re a little more reserved in everyday life.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Ms. Guler was more blunt. (She\u2019s a Scorpio.) \u201cVirgos are kind of a nerdy sign, so it makes sense that they\u2019re still on Tumblr,\u201d she said.\\r\\n<h2>2. Leo\\r\\n<br>Ms. Brennan had an explanation for the runners-up, too, like Leos, which ranked second.\\r\\n<br>\u201cLeos are very socially active, which translates immediately to social media,\u201d she said. \u201cThey love connection, they often communicate through humor. And they wear their heart on their sleeves.\u201d\\r\\n<br>She paused, and added, \u201cThey also like to talk about themselves.\u201d\\r\\n<br>A lot of people are born in late July and August, too, so it may be that Leos and Virgos are simply overrepresented in the numbers.\\r\\n<h2>3. Aries\\r\\n<br>But that\u2019s not true of Aries, the first sign in the zodiac, which showed up third on Tumblr\u2019s list. Why were they overrepresented on Tumblr?\\r\\n<p>\u201cAries are always on their phone,\u201d Ms. Brennan said.\\r\\n<h2>4. Scorpio\\r\\n<br>It may be that the Tumblr rankings largely correspond to people researching their own signs. But Scorpios are the sign that is perhaps of most interest to people who are not Scorpios. Ms. Brennan said that Scorpio blogs abound on Tumblr.\\r\\n<br>\u201cI think there\u2019s kind of a mystery around the Scorpio that people are really drawn to,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t have the data to back it \u2026 it\u2019s kind of my theory that a lot of people are just trying to figure out Scorpios.\u201d\\r\\n<br>That said, Scorpios are basically guaranteed to remind you when their season comes around, whether verbally or with a link to an object they desire. Mejuri, a Canadian jewelry company that targets young people, said that its Scorpio necklace was the most popular of its 12 Zodiac necklaces. (The Gemini necklace was the runner-up.) \\r\\n<br>And then, there\u2019s \u2026\\r\\n<h2>12. Sagittarius\\r\\n<br>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me that Sagittarius is toward the bottom,\u201d Ms. Guler said. \u201cI feel like part of Sagittarius\u2019s nature is that they don\u2019t seem like astrology nerds. There\u2019s, like, a healthy dose of skepticism in Sagittarius, so it makes sense that they\u2019re at the bottom.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Happy Sagittarius Season, y\u2019all.\\r\\n<br>A Word About the Rankings\\r\\n<br>Tumblr takes note of any action taken on the site (searches, posts, reblogs) and gives more weight to those that are more visible (posts and reblogs, for instance, matter more than searches). Tumblr tags actions that pertain to certain topics, like astrology or ships, and, at the end of the year, compiles a definitive list for each topic. Here\u2019s the full astrology list.\\r\\n<br>1.

As the cells proliferate, they secrete a chemical that causes the bone marrow to fill with scar tissue (\u201cfibrosis\u201d). \\r\\n<br>The remaining normal myeloid cells evacuate to safer territory in the spleen, and the spleen swells, squashing the nearby stomach but making the abdomen look overly full. Consequently, the person with the disease becomes progressively malnourished from an inability to take in enough calories. My patient had lost 25 pounds in the preceding six months as a result, even as her waistline expanded and made her feel uncomfortable, even unwieldy from her new girth.\\r\\n<br>I had prescribed the one drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for such conditions, and it worked well for her: Her spleen shrank back to a normal size, she gained back some weight, and she had resumed having a good quality of life.\\r\\n<p>But the drug is not curative, and when I saw her again recently, she told me she had lost her appetite, she had dropped a few pounds, and I noticed that she was wearing pants with an elastic waistband, to accommodate her swelling abdomen.\\r\\n<br>\u201cI figured the medicine had stopped working,\u201d she told me. \u201cI try to take in a few small meals over the course of the day, but I always feel full and can only eat but so much.\u201d\\r\\n<br>I nodded sympathetically. We discussed the paucity of available treatment options and settled on a clinical trial of a new oral drug that had shown promise in preliminary studies. She asked me about the side effects of the medication.\\r\\n<br>I told her that any drug used to treat her myelofibrosis has the potential of making her blood counts worse, meaning she would be at higher risk of bleeding or infections and might need transfusions.\\r\\n<br>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been used in enough patients with your diagnosis yet to identify side effects that are rarer,\u201d I said, having reviewed the clinical trial protocol before I talked with her. \u201cFor the same reason, I can\u2019t tell you precisely how well it will work, though in previous studies between one-quarter and one-third of patients had symptoms that improved.\u201d\\r\\n<p>She nodded. \u201cWell, we have to do something to try and make me feel better. Let\u2019s go for it.\u201d\\r\\n<br>She returned to our cancer center for screening laboratory studies, and once we confirmed that she was eligible for the trial, we gave her a bottle of pills to start taking and she went back home.\\r\\n<br>A few days later, the research nurse poked her head into my office with news about our patient.\\r\\n<br>\u201cDid you hear? She was admitted to her local hospital.\u201d\\r\\n<br>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding!\u201d I said in disbelief. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\\r\\n<br>\u201cShe felt lightheaded and went to the E.R. I think she had a bleed in her abdomen. You can check her labs and scans on the computer.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Our patients\u2019 medical records, as is the case at many hospitals, are all electronic, and have been so for about 15 years. As more and more hospitals have adopted electronic medical records, their records have become linked with ours, and we can now see results of laboratory and radiology tests performed elsewhere, enabling better continuity of care.\\r\\n<br>I accessed her medical record and reviewed her lab results in a hospital 130 miles away. She was anemic and her white blood cell count had quintupled.\\r\\n<br>\u201cDo you think the trial drug caused this?\u201d the research nurse asked. \u201cOr did her myelofibrosis get worse?\u201d\\r\\n<br>I couldn\u2019t tell. I found a note from the E.R. doctor mentioning a CT scan that showed blood in her belly, but the actual scan results were still pending.\\r\\n<p>I logged back into the computer an hour later. The CT report, now available, showed active bleeding in her abdomen. I also saw a series of orders for platelet transfusions. Good \u2014 that\u2019s what I would have done.\\r\\n<br>A couple of hours later, I read that she was transferred to the intensive care unit. They were giving her fluids for her low blood pressure. Then, her labs revealed a problem in her ability to form blood clots, which would make it hard to stem the bleeding. She was given clotting factors to help.\\r\\n<br>I felt as if, in starting her medication, I had launched a drone carrying aircraft ordnance and, like the military personnel who control these devices, was now remotely watching the havoc that its missiles had wrought. The substance of who my patient was had been reduced to blips on a screen detailing abnormal laboratory values, complicated medical terms like \u201cdisseminated intravascular coagulopathy,\u201d and clipped, cautionary phrases in the doctor and nursing notes.\\r\\n<br>A nephrology consult was called for kidney failure. My patient was deteriorating in real time, on the computer.\\r\\n<br>The following day, she was transferred to our hospital. As I was about to leave my office to go see her, the research nurse stopped me. My patient had a cardiac arrest a couple of hours after her arrival and had died.\\r\\n<br>My initial instinct was to turn back to my computer and read the death note in her electronic medical record, the disembodied source of truth about her for the past 48 hours.\\r\\n<br>But it was no substitute for the person I had come to know over years.\\r\\n<br>Recognizing the foolishness of looking for the death note, I stopped myself and instead locked eyes with the research nurse for a few seconds.

Here are some of Dr. Pidich\u2019s tips, all of which she keeps top of mind for her own travels.\\r\\n<h2>Carry a food allergy card in multiple languages\\r\\n<br>Have a card handy that lists your food allergies in the language or languages spoken at your destination. You can create your own cards with simple notecards or sturdy paper, or order them from Allergy Translation, which charges $8 to create one card through its app or website. (You can print as many copies of each card as you want once you place an order.)\\r\\n<p>Make sure that your cards clearly list which foods you can\u2019t eat, rather than just stating what you\u2019re allergic to. For example, my allergy cards don\u2019t just say that I\u2019m allergic to gluten and dairy, they say that wheat and wheat-based products such as soy and anything containing milk, including yogurt, are off-limits.\\r\\n<br>Similarly, Dr. Pidich\u2019s cards say that she can\u2019t eat clams, shrimp and lobster. She learned the hard way how important it is to be super specific on her cards: her allergy card when she traveled to Tulum, Mexico a few years ago simply said in Spanish that she was allergic to shellfish, but she was served a dish with shrimp and ended up with hives all over her body.\\r\\n<h2>Order with an abundance of caution\\r\\n<br>This may sound obvious, but in an ideal scenario, you always travel with food allergy cards and the people serving you understand what you\u2019re not allowed to eat.\\r\\n<br>But say you forget your cards, or think \u201coh, this looks fine\u201d because your trigger foods aren\u2019t on the ingredient list. Dr. Pidich said that you still shouldn\u2019t assume that what you\u2019re eating is safe. Certain foods and drinks, in particular, including sauces, salad dressings, soups and cocktails hide common allergens such as wheat, nuts, dairy and shellfish.\\r\\n<br>Restaurant cooks often use flour to thicken sauces, for example, while soups can have shellfish broth, and salad dressings are blended with soy sauce or nut oils. Ask any vegetarian or vegan what it\u2019s like to be surprised when their salad dressing has cheese in it or the vegetable soup has been prepared with chicken broth, and you\u2019ll understand what it\u2019s like. In short, even if you think you\u2019re being cautious, be extra cautious.\\r\\n<p><h2>Travel with a food stash\\r\\n<br>There\u2019s nothing worse than going hungry on your trip because you can\u2019t find enough safe food to eat. Dr. Pidich highly recommended packing plenty of snacks and a few meal replacement options on your trip, if you can.\\r\\n<br>Consider nonperishable snacks that are carry-on safe, like powdered protein shakes (go for pea protein powder if you can because it\u2019s easy to digest and the least allergenic, compared with other, usually whey-based, powdered proteins), low-sodium jerky, low-sodium powdered soups that can be rehydrated with hot water, roasted chickpeas, nuts (as long as you\u2019re not allergic to nuts!), and dried fruits or crunchy vegetables.\\r\\n<h2>Consider a hotel room or a Airbnb with a kitchen\\r\\n<br>Having access to a kitchen means you can prepare some meals for yourself. This also cuts down on the stress of not being able to find allergy-safe food to eat.\\r\\n<br>Take your allergy card with you when you go food shopping so that the people working at the supermarket or farmers\u2019 market can you steer you clear of anything you\u2019re allergic to, and make sure to follow our general tips to stay healthy while traveling.\\r\\n<h2>Don\u2019t forget your allergy medicine (but carry it legally)\\r\\n<br>Even if your food allergy isn\u2019t severe, you shouldn\u2019t leave home without your allergy medicine. Sure, you\u2019ll want it just in case you have an uncomfortable reaction like hives or itching, but you shouldn\u2019t assume you can buy what you need locally, depending on where you go.\\r\\n<br>In most common destinations you can, but Dr. Pidich said that it\u2019s better to pack some in your carry-on that you already know and have used. If you have a travel companion, have them carry an extra dose or two of the medicine in case you lose yours. The same goes for an Epi-Pen, if you use one. Finally, make sure you familiarize yourself with your destination\u2019s rules and regulations about prescription (and nonprescription) medication, so you\u2019ll make it through customs with your medicine.\\r\\n<p>\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"health.8.txt\",\"id\":659434478},{\"title\":\"Trilobites: Meet the Spiders That Feed Milk to Their Young\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"The jumping arachnids\u2019 secretions have four times as much protein as cow milk.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>The act of breast-feeding is so fundamental to being a mammal that we named ourselves after it.

The tiny T. magnus, also known as the black ant mimicking jumper, looks like an ant, walks like an ant and even waves its front legs in the air like a pair of antennas (it jumps when threatened or hunting). The species is found mostly in Southeast Asia.\\r\\n<br>The study came about after the lead author, Zhanqi Chen, also of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, noticed that young T. magnus seemed slow to leave the breeding nest, suggesting the mothers were providing some sort of extended child care. That hypothesis received a boost when he and his colleagues observed newborns in the lab and found that neither they, nor their mother, left the nest to find food for the first 20 days.\\r\\n<br>Looking closer, they found that during the first week, the mother was depositing droplets of fluid from her underside onto the nest that the hatchlings would come and drink. After the first week, the offspring would drink the fluid directly from the mother\u2019s body.\\r\\n<br>Adding to their surprise, the researchers found that the mother continued to provide the fluid even after her young began leaving the nest to forage at about 20 days old. The suckling finally ceased at 40 days, though the offspring still used the nest at night for another 20 days.\\r\\n<p>The extended nursing may be an evolutionary response to the creatures\u2019 tiny size and vulnerability.\\r\\n<br>\u201cWe think that it may reflect the high risk of juvenile spiders becoming prey themselves if they have to hunt for their own food,\u201d said Dr. Corlett.\\r\\n<br>It\u2019s also unclear how the T. magnus generates the fluid, which contains 2 milligrams of sugar per milliliter of liquid, 5.2 milligrams of fat and a whopping 124 milligrams of protein. The researchers suspect it may have evolved from trophic eggs \u2014 unviable eggs that some insects produce to feed their young \u2014 because the fluid emerges from the same opening that produces eggs.\\r\\n<br>When the researchers blocked the mother\u2019s ability to produce the milk by covering the opening with correction fluid (a.k.a White Out), all the hatchlings died within 11 days, showing their complete dependence on the substance.\\r\\n<br>Though further study is needed to understand how and why the T. magnus generates the fluid, the study should further challenge the assumption that lactation is a uniquely mammalian trait, said Dr. Corlett. \u201cOur findings suggest that \u2018lactation\u2019 may arise in non-mammals when it provides a significant advantage in offspring survival.\u201d\\r\\n<p>\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"science.4.txt\",\"id\":1868053907},{\"title\":\"Rough Drafts of Richard Feynman\u2019s Ideas Head to Auction\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"The scribblings of a brilliant 20th-century physicist show that he did not get everything right on the first try, either.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>One of the titans of 20th-century physics, Richard Feynman deciphered the interplay of fundamental particles and forces. He wrote popular books in which he portrayed himself as a charming scientific rogue, and played a key role in the investigation of the loss of the space shuttle Challenger. While brilliant, he was not perfect. That becomes evident looking at some of his papers that go up for auction on Friday.\\r\\n<br>Feynman received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 for key insights in understanding the quantum version of electromagnetism, and the medal and citation that came with it is the centerpiece of the auction, conducted by Sotheby\u2019s in New York. But the assorted writings that are also for sale by his family reveal clues into how he worked and thought.\\r\\n<br>\u201cWe tend to have this idea of genius being someone who just sprung out of the womb and had these magical capabilities,\u201d said Cassandra Hatton, the specialist at Sotheby\u2019s in New York who is overseeing the auction. \u201cAnd Feynman himself denied that fact. He always said, \u2018Guys, there\u2019s nothing. There\u2019s no magic here. I\u2019m just somebody who\u2019s very interested and worked very hard and was very curious.\u2019\u201d \\r\\n<p>During World War II, Feynman was part of the Manhattan Project to build an atomic bomb. The physicists in Los Alamos, N.M., where the secret atomic research was conducted, were worried that workers producing plutonium in Oak Ridge, Tenn., were not heeding safety precautions. They wanted to explain the science of why the material was so dangerous. \\r\\n<p>[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\\r\\n<br>Feynman, in his 20s, flew to Oak Ridge to give the talk. Some of these pages may have been notes from that talk. Others may be versions he revised later for other talks to other audiences. \\r\\n<br>\u201cHe\u2019ll come back to certain themes and work them over and over,\u201d Ms. Hatton said, pointing to several versions of this atomic research paper.\\r\\n<p>Feynman, who died in 1988, donated his archive of scientific papers to the California Institute of Technology, where he spent much of his career. The papers offered at auction by his family are the leftovers, the scraps, the rough drafts. But that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not valuable, Ms. Hatton said.\\r\\n<p>\u201cI think they\u2019re more important because they let us see how he got from A to Z,\u201d she said. \u201cThey show us the steps. They show us the little mistakes and the things he crossed out and where he changed his mind and what he decided to refine.\u201d\\r\\n<br>While some people are very particular about a pen or type of paper, Feynman usually grabbed whatever was closest and started scribbling, usually without noting a title, date or place. That made it challenging to organize the papers as sometimes he continued his thought on a different colored piece of paper with a different pen.\\r\\n<br>The written scribble on this sheet include the \u201cFeynman diagrams\u201d that he developed to quickly summarize a subatomic interaction with lines and squiggles.\\r\\n<p>A few of Feynman\u2019s sketches are interspersed among his notes. \\r\\n<p>Included in the auction are books from Feynman\u2019s library, including a textbook written by Paul Dirac, another giant of 20th-century physics. Feynman wrote comments in the margins. \u201cAnalyze this some day,\u201d he wrote on one page. \\r\\n<p>In recent years, Feynman\u2019s reputation as a womanizer has led some critics to re-evaluate his academic legacy. Some of his behavior, like dating undergraduates, would likely be grounds for academic sanction today.\\r\\n<br>Included in the random pieces of paper at auction is an example of some of this behavior: place mats from Gianonni\u2019s, a strip club in Pasadena, Calif., not far from his home, where Feynman often went. While there, he would scribble on the backs of the place mats.\\r\\n<br>For the mathematical notations on this particular place mat, \u201cWe couldn't tie it to any specific problem,\u201d Ms. Hatton said. \u201cIt seems almost like he was just playing around.\u201d\\r\\n<br>In his book \u201cSurely You\u2019re Joking, Mr. Feynman,\u201d he recalled, \u201cI\u2019d sit in one of the booths and work a little physics on the paper place mats with the scalloped edges, and sometimes I\u2019d draw one of the dancing girls or one of the customers, just to practice.\u201d\\r\\n<p>One of Feynman\u2019s most famous talks was \u201cThere\u2019s Plenty of Room at the Bottom\u201d in 1959, which predicted the advent of nanotechnology, creating machines at the scale of molecules. This document, above, was found among the papers that the family had. It appears to have been prepared for a version of the talk given at El Camino College in California. \\r\\n<p>Feynman was also well known as a lecturer, striving to find the clearest way to explain a difficult concept. \\r\\n<br>On March 13, 1964, he gave a talk in a freshman physics class at Caltech about the motion of planets. An archivist found a transcript of the lecture, once believed lost, and it was turned into a book, \u201cFeynman's Lost Lecture: The Motion of Planets Around the Sun.\u201d In sifting through the papers that the family possessed, \u201cWhat we found is a much more extensive version of that lost lecture,\u201d Ms. Hatton said.\\r\\n<p>Outside of physics, Feynman did magic and played bongo drums. This is a tambourine that Feynman bought in Brazil. He taught himself Portuguese and how to play the tambourine in a samba band.\\r\\n<p>The Nobel medal is 23-karat gold. (Since 1980, they are now 18-karat gold plated with 24-karat gold.)\\r\\n<br>Feynman was not happy about the 4 a.m. phone call that he had won a Nobel. He complained about being woken up and hung up.

Only one in the last 24 hours \u2014 stunningly low compared to the long lists he used to scroll through last year in a grim morning routine.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThey just began to abruptly drop off,\u201d said Dr. Marriott, who oversees the handoff of patients from local rescue squads to Premier Health, the region\u2019s biggest hospital system.\\r\\n<br>Overdose deaths in Montgomery County, anchored by Dayton, have plunged this year, after a stretch so bad that the coroner\u2019s office kept running out of space and having to rent refrigerated trailers. The county had 548 overdose deaths by Nov. 30 last year; so far this year there have been 250, a 54 percent decline.\\r\\n<br>Dayton, a hollowed-out manufacturing center at the juncture of two major interstates, had one of the highest opioid overdose death rates in the nation in 2017 and the worst in Ohio. Now, it may be at the leading edge of a waning phase of an epidemic that has killed hundreds of thousands of people in the United States over the last decade, including nearly 50,000 last year.\\r\\n<p>For the first time in years, the number of opioid deaths nationwide has begun to dip, according to preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2014 with totals for the preceding 12 months falling slightly but steadily between December 2017 and April 2018. The flattening curve \u2014 along with declining opioid prescription rates and survey data suggesting far fewer Americans tried heroin last year and more got addiction treatment \u2014 is the first encouraging news in a while.\\r\\n<br>While it\u2019s too soon to know if the improvement is part of a long-term trend, it is clear there are some lessons to be learned from Dayton. The New York Times spent several days here interviewing police and public health officials; doctors, nurses and other treatment providers; people recovering from opioid addiction and people who are still using heroin and other drugs. \\r\\n<br>They point to a variety of factors they believe have contributed to the sharp drop in mortality.\\r\\n<p><h2>Medicaid expansion hugely increased access to treatment \\r\\n<br>Mayor Nan Whaley thinks nothing has had as big an impact on overdose deaths as Gov. John Kasich\u2019s decision to expand Medicaid in 2015, a move that gave nearly 700,000 low-income adults access to free addiction and mental health treatment.\\r\\n<br>In Dayton, that\u2019s drawn more than a dozen new treatment providers in the last year alone, including residential programs and outpatient clinics that dispense methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone, the three medications approved by the F.D.A. to treat opioid addiction. \\r\\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the basis \u2014 the basis \u2014 for everything we\u2019ve built regarding treatment,\u201d Ms. Whaley said in an interview at City Hall. \u201cIf you\u2019re a state that does not have Medicaid expansion, you can\u2019t build a system for addressing this disease.\u201d\\r\\n<br>An event held every other month at a church in Dayton\u2019s East End shows the scope of available options. Called Conversations for Change, it gives people addicted to drugs a chance to have a meal and to meet treatment providers, who on a recent evening had set up more than a dozen tables.\\r\\n<br>\u201cWe have medication-assisted treatment programs, withdrawal management \u2014 come see me,\u201d a representative for one program, Project Cure, urged the two dozen people present.\\r\\n<br>\u201cIf you\u2019re interested in Narcan training, we\u2019re going to get started in a few minutes \u2014 you can bring your food with you,\u201d offered a representative of another program.\\r\\n<br>Gov. John Kasich has said the state is spending $1 billion a year to address the opioid epidemic, and a big chunk of that is Medicaid funds. With Medicaid now paying for nearly all low-income residents who need it to get addiction treatment, Ohio has been able to go beyond the basics in spending its share of several billion dollars in the opioid grant money the Trump administration has been giving to states. One example: paying for people who go to jail and lose their Medicaid coverage to stay in treatment with their regular provider while they\u2019re incarcerated.\\r\\n<p><h2>Carfentanil, an incredibly toxic fentanyl analog, has faded \\r\\n<br>It\u2019s entirely possible that the biggest factor in Dayton has been the dwindling presence on the streets of carfentanil \u2014 an analog of the synthetic opioid fentanyl that the C.D.C. describes as 10,000 times more powerful than morphine. Ohio was particularly hammered by carfentanil in recent years; according to the C.D.C., the state had 1,106 carfentanil-related deaths from July 2016 through June 2017, compared with only 130 in nine other hard-hit states combined.\\r\\n<p>During that period, carfentanil was showing up regularly in Dayton\u2019s street drugs, including methamphetamine, cocaine and fentanyl. Nobody has figured out why Ohio saw more of it than anywhere else, but there\u2019s no question it played a huge role in the explosion of deaths in Dayton early last year.\\r\\n<br>By mid-2017 carfentanil\u2019s presence was fading \u2014 maybe in part because traffickers realized how much of their customer base it was killing, said Timothy Plancon, the Drug Enforcement Administration special agent in charge of Ohio. \\r\\n<p>The news is not all good. Cocaine and particularly meth use is rising fast in the Dayton area, as it is nationwide. And they\u2019re often mixed with fentanyl; 77 percent of the overdose deaths in Montgomery County from January through April involved fentanyl, roughly the same as during the same period last year. The national data also suggests overdoses involving fentanyl continue to rise, along with those involving cocaine and meth, while deaths involving heroin and prescription drugs are falling slightly.\\r\\n<br>Since late summer, deaths in Montgomery County have come closer to matching the same period last year \u2014 a reminder that the battle is far from over.  \\r\\n<br>\u201cI still go to more wakes than I care to tell you about,\u201d said Lori Erion, the founding president of Families of Addicts, a local support group. \u201cHave we got this beat or licked? Absolutely not, on any level.\u201d\\r\\n<p><h2>Naloxone is everywhere\\r\\n<p>By now, most Americans have heard of naloxone \u2014 also known by the brand name Narcan \u2014 the medication that reverses opioid overdoses if administered quickly enough, by injection or nasal spray. But few American cities have blanketed their neighborhoods with naloxone like Dayton has. \\r\\n<br>Montgomery County agencies distributed 3,300 naloxone kits last year, and are on course to more than double that number this year, holding trainings at treatment centers and 12-step meetings as well as at local businesses and schools.\\r\\n<br>Starting in 2014, Richard Biehl, the Dayton police chief, directed all his officers to carry naloxone \u2014 going against some of his peers in other Ohio cities, including a sheriff in a neighboring county who outright refused to equip his deputies with it. Some in Ohio and elsewhere continue to oppose so-called harm reduction tools like naloxone, saying they enable drug use, but the evidence is overwhelming that they save lives.  \\r\\n<br>\u201cWe really jumped on it because we saw it as absolutely consistent with our public mission to save lives,\u201d Chief Biehl said.\\r\\n<br>Research suggests he was right. A recent study from Stanford estimated that wider availability of naloxone could prevent 21,000 deaths over the next decade \u2014 more than expanding access to medications for addiction or reducing painkiller prescriptions could.\\r\\n<br>But as fentanyl analogs \u2014 whose chemical structure is slightly different and can be more lethal \u2014 started entering the drug supply in Dayton, it became harder to revive overdose victims with the standard dose of naloxone. So the city, with state support, has spent a lot more to provide higher doses \u2014 $350,000 last year.\\r\\n<br>The investment has paid off, said Helen Jones-Kelley, executive director of Alcohol, Drug Addiction and Mental Health Services for Montgomery County. \u201cIf nothing else, you get that second chance with them \u2014 and in some cases that third or fourth chance,\u201d she said. \u201cIt gives people the opportunity to get connected to services, who would not otherwise have had that chance at life.\u201d\\r\\n<p><h2>There is more support for people when treatment ends\\r\\n<p>Even though there are many more treatment options here now, that doesn\u2019t mean people stay in treatment as long as they should. But the city has an unusually large network of recovery support groups, including neighborhood clubs that provide space for Narcotics Anonymous meetings to Ms. Erion\u2019s group, which has thousands of members in Montgomery and four surrounding counties. \\r\\n<br>Dayton is also investing heavily in peer support \u2014 training people who are far enough along in their recovery to work as coaches or mentors for others who are trying to stop using, including in emergency rooms.\\r\\n<br>One example is an initiative called G.R.O.W. \u2014 Getting Recovery Options Working \u2014 that dispatches teams of social workers, medics, police officers and people in recovery to homes of people who have recently overdosed. The teams offer to help them get into treatment and to drive them to a program. They also supply them and their families with naloxone to have on hand in case it\u2019s needed.\\r\\n<br>\u201cI just stop and plant a little seed,\u201d said Darcy Shepherd, a peer supporter who went through treatment for opioid addiction almost five years ago. \u201cI will pull up to them, ask how they are doing and if they are ready for treatment, and when they are, to give me a call.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Joshua Lewis, 37,  is among those who have managed to stay alive long enough to benefit from recovery supports. He overdosed repeatedly last year on heroin and fentanyl, while also using meth. His girlfriend found him a bed at a local treatment center, after which he spent three months at Joshua Recovery Ministries, a religious program that provides housing for men recovering from addiction. He learned how to read there, he said, and is now training to become a peer supporter. He doesn\u2019t use medications for addiction but said he would not discourage others from doing so.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThere are more addicts coming out of the shadows,\u201d he said. \u201cThe stigma\u2019s being broke.\u201d\\r\\n<p><h2>Police and public health workers actually agree\\r\\n<br>When Sam Quinones, the author of \u201cDreamland: The True Tale of America\u2019s Opiate Epidemic,\u201d testified before Congress earlier this year, he said that \u201cthe more cops and public health nurses go out for a beer, bridge that cultural chasm between them,\u201d the better chance the country had at solving the problem.\\r\\n<br>Dayton has largely succeeded at bridging that chasm, which too often pits a punitive, abstinence-only approach to addiction against one that seeks to reduce deaths by any means possible. Law enforcement and public health representatives work hand in hand on a two-year-old Community Overdose Action Team, sharing data and strategizing with dozens of local organizations. Chief Biehl was fully supportive of the city\u2019s decision to set up a syringe exchange in 2014. Research has consistently found that such programs, which allow people who inject drugs to trade dirty needles for clean ones, prevent deaths related to infections like H.I.V., hepatitis C,  and endocarditis.\\r\\n<br>While other cities, including Charleston, W. Va., and Santa Ana, Calif., closed their needle exchanges this year because of opposition, including from the police, Dayton\u2019s program continues to operate at two sites, each open once a week. The needle exchanges also help clients sign up for Medicaid and connect them with addiction treatment.\\r\\n<br>The city secured a federal grant for a pilot program that distributes fentanyl test strips, which can be used to check street drugs for the presence of various fentanyl analogues. Only a handful of cities are sanctioning the test strips at this point. Sheila Humphrey, the Dayton director for Harm Reduction Ohio, a nonprofit group, has given out thousands of strips, often at parks and community events.\\r\\n<br>\u201cIf it\u2019s about conserving and protecting life\u201d Chief Biehl said, \u201cit has to be considered as an option.\u201d\\r\\n<p>[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"health.7.txt\",\"id\":-1233719476},{\"title\":\"Trump Claims Nafta Victory but Deal Faces Long Odds in U.S.\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"The president said gaining congressional approval would not be much of a problem.

His staff spent much of the preceding 48 hours coaxing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada to appear at the event so that three North American leaders, not just Mr. Trump and President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico, would appear onstage, according to people familiar with the planning.\\r\\n<br>But it was strictly ceremonial. Under the United States\u2019 fast-track trade rules, the deal must pass the House, where all bills that affect federal revenue must originate, before moving to the Senate for final passage.\\r\\n<br>Technically, the deal that the three trading partners signed cannot be altered. But in reality, the administration is free to renegotiate with Canada and Mexico to make changes that could ultimately be included in final legislation. If nothing is passed, Mr. Trump could pull out of Nafta, as he has long threatened, or simply continue operating under the old rules.\\r\\n<br>The Democratic takeover of the House has created anxiety among business groups and legislators, who are urging Republican leaders to push for a vote on the proposal in the lame-duck session, before Democrats assume control.\\r\\n<br>\u201cManufacturers need certainty now, not later,\u201d said Jay Timmons, president and chief executive of the National Association of Manufacturers. \u201cWith two million American jobs dependent on exports to Canada and Mexico, Congress needs to move expeditiously.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Mr. Timmons\u2019s group, along with other trade associations and Republican Senators Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, are pressing House and Senate leaders to quickly pass the deal.\\r\\n<br>Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, has been quietly pushing a revision to the trade agreement aimed at improving wages and working conditions in Mexico. The provision would require that Mexican imports to the United States be certified as having been produced in accordance with labor standards, according to American officials.\\r\\n<p>The plan, which won the support of Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, this year, would carry stiff criminal penalties for importers who violate the trade agreement and would also bolster inspection procedures.\\r\\n<br>But it was rejected by Mexican officials, including the incoming president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, according to two people familiar with the talks. But Mr. Brown, who is close to Mr. Lighthizer, is renewing his push to increase the pressure on Mexico, and is likely to submit a range of proposals to the administration, a spokeswoman for Mr. Brown said.\\r\\n<br>President Trump badly wants union leaders to back his signature trade deal, but they have thus far demurred.\\r\\n<br>He has met with labor officials three times since February urging them to sign onto the new deal, according to administration officials, repeatedly assuring participants that he was driving the hardest possible bargain.\\r\\n<br>In recent months, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides stepped up their courtship in a futile attempt to persuade union leaders, especially the United Steelworkers president, Leo W. Gerard, to publicly back the new Nafta before the midterms. But Mr. Gerard has held off, and on Friday he pressed the White House to negotiate a better agreement.\\r\\n<br>\u201cOnly when all the issues have been resolved and it\u2019s clear that Mexico is fully and faithfully recognizing workers\u2019 rights, should Congress vote on the agreement and implementing legislation,\u201d Mr. Gerard said in a statement.\\r\\n<br>There are also lingering concerns about the deal in Canada, where officials remain incensed that the agreement does not include a deal to lift the sweeping steel and aluminum tariffs that Mr. Trump has imposed on Canada, Mexico and other allies.\\r\\n<p>Until late Thursday night, it was not clear that Mr. Trudeau would attend the signing.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Lighthizer and his Canadian counterparts wrangled over a possible deal that would impose quotas on metal imports in exchange for a gradual decrease in the tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. But those talks have so far failed.\\r\\n<br>If Mr. Trump celebrated the agreement as a fulfillment of his campaign promise to scrap Nafta, Mr. Trudeau played down the deal as a backstop that \u201cmaintains stability\u201d for his country\u2019s economy.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here today,\u201d he said alluding to his last-minute decision to appear in front of the cameras with Mr. Trump and Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto.\\r\\n<br>But his attendance also seemed intended to temper Mr. Trump\u2019s glee, and he lamented recent North American plant closures by General Motors as \u201ca heavy blow\u201d and sharply criticized the metal tariffs as an unnecessary drag on the economies of both countries.\\r\\n<br>\u201cDonald, it\u2019s all the more reason we need to keep working to remove the tariffs on steel and aluminum between our countries,\u201d he said as Mr. Trump looked on.\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"business.3.txt\",\"id\":1131488870},{\"title\":\"Wealth Matters: When the Social Mission Comes Before Making a Buck\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"The \u201cgiveback\u201d strategy, in which a social cause is an integral part of a corporate mission and brand marketing, has become a necessity for some entrepreneurs.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>A granola bar can stave off hunger, but can it save a life? Two American actors, Ryan Devlin and Todd Grinnell, are aiming to find out.\\r\\n<br>On a humanitarian trip to Liberia in 2007, the pair visited a clinic where they saw beds filled with children being treated for malnutrition \u2014 a preventable condition, they were told, if the clinic had food aid.\\r\\n<br>After returning home, they were intent on doing something to help. Instead of starting a nonprofit organization to raise money for the clinic, they gathered two other actor friends, Kristen Bell and Ravi Patel, and in 2013 created a company called This Bar Saves Lives.\\r\\n<br>Their idea is based on a growing \u201cbuy one, give one\u201d social entrepreneurship strategy. Every time someone buys a granola bar, the company donates a packet of Plumpy\u2019Nut, a nutrient paste, to a child in need.\\r\\n<p>\u201cThis Bar Saves Lives is a company that wants to help in malnutrition, and we happen to sell bars,\u201d said Paul Yoo, the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe\u2019re not a bar company with a social mission.\u201d\\r\\n<br>So-called giveback companies, whose social cause is an integral part of their corporate mission and brand marketing, have been around for more than a decade and include such mainstream businesses as the eyewear seller Warby Parker and Toms, which began as a shoe company but has expanded to sell apparel and accessories.\\r\\n<br>But what was a novelty then has become a business necessity for some entrepreneurs.\\r\\n<br>\u201cNowadays, people expect it,\u201d said Kevin Tighe II, founder and chief executive of Coastal Co., which sells surf apparel and donates a portion of sales to clean up beaches. \u201cIf you\u2019re not participating in a way to give back, it\u2019s almost frowned upon.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Mr. Tighe, who grew up in suburban Maryland dreaming of surfing, wanted to differentiate his company from the competition, so he connected it to a surf-related cause. He chose Heal the Bay, which works on the beaches around Los Angeles. But the charitable endeavor was also about positioning his business.\\r\\n<p>\u201cIn the long run, it\u2019s about building a sustainable brand,\u201d Mr. Tighe said. \u201cIf you\u2019re just focused on the revenue, you\u2019re not going to have that sustainable aspect.\u201d\\r\\n<p>Philanthropy has long been a big part of business, with chief executives dictating where charitable dollars should go or how employees ought to volunteer their time. But some entrepreneurs are letting their customers drive the giving by how much they spend.\\r\\n<br>\u201cMy research basically shows that companies give back for two primary reasons,\u201d said C. B. Bhattacharya, a marketing professor who holds the Zoffer Chair of Sustainability and Ethics at the University of Pittsburgh\u2019s Katz Graduate School of Business. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do \u2014 corporations need to give back to society \u2014 and they believe it\u2019s the smart thing to do, in terms of stakeholders taking notice of what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Still, there isn\u2019t a road map to success, and the journey can be full of bumps. When Richard and Ashley Perkin started Gells four years ago to manufacture belts, they thought they had landed on a clever way to link sales to causes they believed in.\\r\\n<br>The couple, who live in Southport, Conn., selected five small charities that they wanted to help. They also had belts in five colors, each matched to a charity that took a share of 5 percent of sales. The only problem was, most customers bought navy blue belts, which Gells had linked to the Blue Ocean Society for Marine Conservation.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThe Blue Ocean Society was getting a greater share of the 5 percent, and that didn\u2019t seem right to us,\u201d Mr. Perkin said. \u201cIt also became an accounting headache as we went into stores.\u201d\\r\\n<br>The couple changed tack and decided to split the money earmarked for charities evenly.\\r\\n<br>Such logistical problems are not uncommon, particularly for a small entrepreneurial business. Pledgeling, an organization that works with companies on their corporate giving strategies, aims to help with this. As part of its \u201cgive and grow\u201d program, it operates the charitable component of a company\u2019s business, vets the recipient groups and aims to make the accounting process smoother.\\r\\n<p>It also created an impact calculator that can be displayed on a company\u2019s website to show customers how their purchases are helping, said James Citron, chief executive of Pledgeling.\\r\\n<br>For some entrepreneurs, this was a real advance. Mr. Tighe of Coastal Co. said he liked the ability to show its customers how many beaches were being cleaned up in a given month.\\r\\n<br>But Rich Brown, who started La Menagerie, an animal-themed jewelry company, with his wife, Fran, was leery of the calculator. Their charitable beneficiary is the World Wildlife Fund, but because the company is new, the 5 percent of sales that would go to the charity would be small at first.\\r\\n<p>He said he also feared that displaying the calculator would essentially give his competitors an easy way to calculate his sales. Yet knowing the value of promoting social entrepreneurship, he said he was trying to find a way to show the impact of customers\u2019 purchases on the company\u2019s website through other means.\\r\\n<br>Some entrepreneurs find that no good deed goes unpunished.\\r\\n<br>\u201cWhat makes \u2018buy one, give one\u2019 great is you can immediately imagine someone getting what you just bought,\u201d said Jerry Davis, associate dean of the University of Michigan Ross School of Business. \u201cBut it is not the most effective form of altruism for corporations.\u201d\\r\\n<br>For example, recipients may not need or want what a company is sending them, he said. After a disaster, a common instinct is to send supplies, when it might be better to send money so the supplies can be bought closer to the area.\\r\\n<p>Several years back, Toms was criticized for its \u201cbuy one, give one\u201d model. Originally, for every pair of shoes a consumer bought, the company donated a pair to someone in the developing world.\\r\\n<br>Consumers got on board, and it was marketing gold. Bain Capital, the private equity firm, invested.\\r\\n<br>But  criticism began to mount: Did poor people in the developing world really need shoes, or might they be better off with food or plain old cash? Were these free shoes putting local cobblers out of business?\\r\\n<br>\u201cThere may be unintended consequences,\u201d said N. Craig Smith, a professor who holds the Chair of Ethics and Social Responsibility at Insead in Fontainebleau, France. \u201cTo do something that\u2019s right and to do something consumers would support, it has an integrity to it, albeit with unintended consequences.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Toms changed its policy and now manufactures a portion of the shoes it gives away in the countries that receive them.\\r\\n<br>In the end, it\u2019s the authenticity that counts. With Gells, Mr. Perkin said the couple checked in with their charity partners to see how they could help each other.\\r\\n<br>\u201cWe want transparency so we can say, this is where our donations are going,\u201d he said. He pointed to discussions with the Blue Ocean Society to adopt a whale.\\r\\n<br>\u201cIt\u2019s great to say you give back, but to attach it to something meaningful, we think that\u2019s what the customer wants to see and hear,\u201d Mr. Perkin said. \u201cThere are a lot of companies out there that want to give back. The customer wants to know even more.\u201d\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"business.6.txt\",\"id\":472079094},{\"title\":\"Justice Dept.

Other parties to the case, including a big pension fund for miners and states facing costly environmental cleanups, got pennies for every dollar they were owed.\\r\\n<br>A McKinsey partner, Kevin Carmody, provided testimony to the bankruptcy court that the plan was in the best interests of all classes of creditors.\\r\\n<br>Federal law \u201cplaces the burden on estate professionals to make required disclosures to ensure their disinterestedness,\u201d wrote John P. Fitzgerald III of the trustee office, which polices the bankruptcy court system and enforces the disclosure rules.\\r\\n<br>Instead of making the required disclosures, Mr. Fitzgerald said, McKinsey spent more than two years dissembling and forcing the Justice Department and other parties \u201cto search for needles in haystacks.\u201d\\r\\n<p>Mr. Fitzgerald said he had determined that McKinsey\u2019s investment operation was not, as the company has long said, a \u201cblind trust\u201d separate from the consulting firm \u2014 in part because McKinsey\u2019s president, Jon Garcia, sat on the board of the investment group.\\r\\n<p>The federal office said McKinsey had tried to make it appear as if the investment unit\u2019s decisions were made by independent staff members, avoiding any mention that Mr. Garcia received regular reports on its decisions and ratified them.\\r\\n<br>\u201cMcKinsey\u2019s misleading representation and lack of transparency regarding Mr. Garcia\u2019s role undermines the very purpose\u201d of the bankruptcy disclosure rules, Mr. Fitzgerald wrote.\\r\\n<br>In a statement, McKinsey said its disclosures \u201cfully meet the terms of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\u201d\\r\\n<br>\u201cWe have been transparent about the connections we were disclosing and the process utilized to identify those connections,\u201d the company said. It added, \u201cAs always, McKinsey is committed to taking any guidance the U.S. trustee deems appropriate to give.\u201d\\r\\n<br>McKinsey has made repeated statements, in court and on its website, that its investment division is walled off from its consulting business. That, McKinsey has said, precludes any possibility that the investments could taint the consultants\u2019 advice.\\r\\n<br>Since there is no risk of undue influence, McKinsey has said, it does not have to disclose its investment activities to the court when it works on a bankruptcy case.\\r\\n<br>That argument was eventually challenged by Jay Alix, a retired bankruptcy restructuring expert. During the Alpha Natural Resources bankruptcy, Mr. Alix formed an investment partnership and became an unsecured creditor, giving him standing to challenge McKinsey over its disclosures. He eventually moved to have the bankruptcy reopened for an investigation of potential fraud.\\r\\n<p>That led to the investigation by the Office of the United States Trustee. Judge Kevin R. Huennekens will hear the office\u2019s request on Wednesday at the United States Bankruptcy Court in Richmond.\\r\\n<br>McKinsey\u2019s legal challenges are spreading into other courtrooms.\\r\\n<br>On Friday, a federal bankruptcy judge in Houston, David R. Jones, issued an order for the trustee office to review allegations about McKinsey\u2019s conduct in two bankruptcies there. Those allegations, if true, he said, could constitute criminal activity \u201cand otherwise impugn the integrity of the bankruptcy process.\u201d\\r\\n<p>The judge took pains to say he had not determined if any improper conduct had occurred, but said the Justice Department had an obligation to investigate and ensure the public\u2019s confidence in the system.\\r\\n<br>The order was in response to a lengthy objection filed on Thursday in the bankruptcy of Westmoreland Coal. Mr. Alix, who filed the objection, cited dozens of instances in which, he said, McKinsey\u2019s business relationships were in conflict with its duty to its bankrupt clients.\\r\\n<br>In a statement, McKinsey said it believed it had always complied with disclosure requirements and would challenge Mr. Alix\u2019s \u201cbaseless allegations.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Among the cases he cited were those involving GenOn, whose bankruptcy Judge Jones oversaw last year, and Puerto Rico \u2014 essentially one of the biggest bankruptcies in American history, with $123 billion of debt and unfunded pensions.\\r\\n<p>McKinsey is advising Puerto Rico\u2019s federal oversight board while its investment unit directly and indirectly holds Puerto Rican bonds. McKinsey owns a family of hedge funds called Compass, which holds a class of bonds that, if restructured according to current plans, would return more than double what McKinsey paid for them.\\r\\n<br>None of those holdings were disclosed. McKinsey has said the federal law governing Puerto Rico\u2019s case, called Promesa, contains no provision requiring advisers to be disinterested.\\r\\n<br>The disclosure of McKinsey\u2019s holdings in Puerto Rico by The New York Times prompted the federal oversight board to hire a law firm to investigate.\\r\\n<br>Representative Andy Biggs, an Arizona Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, has disputed McKinsey\u2019s position that it has no disclosure requirements under Promesa.

Decorating Elves, he said, now has 10 full-time employees and adds 50 during the holiday season. (The firm also provides year-round outdoor lighting services.)\\r\\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s becoming bigger,\u201d he said, adding that the company is busy enough that it has to turn down jobs during holiday crunchtime.\\r\\n<br>While Christmas d\u00e9cor accounts for the bulk of his seasonal business, Mr. Schriver said, he also has some demand for Hanukkah-themed displays, like large menorahs illuminated with blue and white lights.\\r\\n<br>Outdoor holiday lighting is so popular that the Association of Outdoor Lighting Professionals, a trade group, gives an annual award just for that category (which Mr. Schriver\u2019s company won in 2016 and 2017).\\r\\n<br>Safety may also be a factor behind the interest in professional installations. The Consumer Product Safety Commission last year estimated that in 2016 there were 14,700 holiday decorating-related injuries treated in emergency rooms, or an average of 240 per day during November and December. The most frequent decorating incidents were falls, the commission said, including three deaths involving falls from ladders.\\r\\n<br>Many professional companies not only hang and remove the holiday lights, but also store the decorations after the holidays.\\r\\n<p>How much does it cost to have a professional take over the decorations? That will vary by region, the size of your house and the dazzle of the display. Basic d\u00e9cor, like lights that outline your roof and front door, may cost $500 or less if you own a single-story home. But if you have a larger house with lots of gables or want more eye-catching d\u00e9cor, the price can stretch to thousands of dollars.\\r\\n<br>At Christmas Decor, a professional holiday decorator with locations across the country and in Canada, the average cost of a display in the United States is $1,650, said Brandon Stephens, the company\u2019s president.

The company said its sales last year rose by 14 percent, with a similar increase expected this year.\\r\\n<br>While classic white lights remain popular, consumers have choices far beyond the traditional. Homeowners may now select tubes of glowing lights that mimic falling snowflakes, giant ornament decorations or app-controlled light strips that blink in patterns synchronized with music.\\r\\n<br>\u201cPeople are looking for that showstopper,\u201d Mr. Stephens said. Specialty items include six-foot-tall, three-dimensional snowflakes.\\r\\n<br>Christmas Decor\u2019s representatives take a photo of your house with a tablet, then superimpose lighting displays on the image. If the suggested display is too costly, the software can adjust the proposed lighting until the represented results fit your budget.\\r\\n<br>While professional installations are costlier than doing it yourself, the advent of LED lighting, which is much more energy-efficient than traditional incandescent bulbs, means powering the holiday d\u00e9cor doesn\u2019t have to be as wallet-draining as it once was. Some people still prefer the look of incandescent lights, but professionals say the quality of LED lighting has improved significantly in recent years. The bulbs no longer \u201cflicker\u201d and are available in a range of colors.\\r\\n<p>Here are some questions and answers about professionally installed holiday lighting:\\r\\n<br>How can I manage the cost of my outdoor holiday display?\\r\\n<br>Try teaming up with other homeowners on your street for a group quote for lighting installation. \u201cIf you and your neighbors get together, you may get a lower per-house rate,\u201d said Sarabeth Asaff, chief writer with Fixr.com, a home services site. Putting the lights on a timer will help manage your electrical costs. And as with other home improvement projects, she said, seek three bids to get a true picture of what the job should cost.\\r\\n<br>What if I prefer hanging lights myself?\\r\\n<br>You have company. The National Retail Federation expects holiday spending, including money spent on decorations, to increase by about 4 percent this year.\\r\\n<br>Christmas Lights Etc., an online d\u00e9cor seller, offers do-it-yourself suggestions on its website, including tips for attaching lights to your gutters.\\r\\n<br>You can also look for advice on choosing lights on Wirecutter, a New York Times affiliate. The site recommends conical LED lights from Christmas Designers.com as the best for outdoor use.\\r\\n<br>Just be careful on those ladders!\\r\\n<br>How much will LED lighting save me on my electric bill?\\r\\n<br>Quite a bit, said Steve Rosenstock, senior manager of customer technical solutions with Edison Electric Institute, an association that represents investor-owned electric companies.\\r\\n<br>A string of 100 large, traditional incandescent light bulbs costs about 9 cents an hour to run, compared with half a cent an hour for a string of mini lights, the institute calculates.

Last year there were roughly 175 homicides per day in Brazil, according to the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety. Often simulating gunfire with his fingers at campaign rallies, Mr. Bolsonaro said he would combat the homicide epidemic by easing firearm laws and giving the police more freedom to shoot suspects.\\r\\n<p>\u201cWe have to stop this politically correct thing, saying that disarming everyone will make Brazil a better place \u2014 it won\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Bolsonaro said in his first post-election television interview, pointing out that the strict regulations now in place have failed to stem the flow of firearms into the hands of criminals.\\r\\n<p>These regulations were created at the turn of the 21st century, when civil society, faced with rising violence and the explosion of the cocaine trade in Brazil, stepped up pressure on the government to register firearms and regulate their use.\\r\\n<br>Congress responded. A restrictive law known as the Disarmament Statute, approved in 2003, required applicants to be at least 25 years old, have no criminal history, provide proof of a steady job and fixed residence, pass a psychological test and have gun training.\\r\\n<br>The regulation also gave Brazilians two options: They can get a license for a self-defense firearm, which must be stored exclusively at home or at a place of work; or for a sporting weapon, which can be stored at home and carried to authorized shooting clubs, always with full documentation. In the case of a firearm for self-defense, the applicant must also formally declare why a gun is needed and have that argument approved by the police.\\r\\n<p>Faced with such an onerous registration process, many gun owners opted to surrender their firearms.\\r\\n<br>Brazil\u2019s murder rate declined 12 percent in the four years after the statute was approved. But then homicides started to climb again, setting a record in 2017 of 30.8 per 100,000 people, according to the Brazilian Forum of Public Security, a research organization. (The United States had five homicides per 100,000 people in 2015 \u2014 the most recent year for which data are available \u2014 down from eight per 100,000 in 1996. Even Mexico had a lower murder rate of 25 per 100,000 last year.)\\r\\n<br>Sales of legal firearms, which also diminished immediately after the Disarmament Statute was introduced, skyrocketed years later. By 2017, there were 42,387 new guns registered with the police, compared with 5,159 in 2004.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s promise to ease gun regulation and give the police greater freedom to shoot is worrying some experts who argue that more guns fuel more violence and that police aggression needs to be curbed, not encouraged. The police in Brazil killed 5,144 people in 2017, a 20 percent increase over the year before.\\r\\n<p>The vast majority of firearms used by criminals were at one time legally acquired \u2014 and legal firearms also cause many deaths as a result of accidents, domestic abuse and disagreements that spiral out of control, said Ivan Marques, the executive director of the Sou da Paz Institute, which focuses on security issues.\\r\\n<br>Studies show that having more firearms in circulation increases the number of deaths, but \u201cthere are no magic solutions,\u201d said Ilona Szab\u00f3, the director of the Igarap\u00e9 Institute, a research group that focuses on security issues. \u201cWe need sustainable measures that make the country safer.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Despite the enthusiasm for Mr. Bolsonaro and anger over the public security crisis, most Brazilians \u2014 55 percent, in a poll conducted by Datafolha right before the elections \u2014 think civilian gun ownership should be banned, although this number has gone down from 68 percent in 2013, when the polling firm Datafolha first conducted a survey asking that question.\\r\\n<p>Luciana Burr, a lawyer from S\u00e3o Paulo, says she has been robbed at gunpoint six times. The first time, she was 15 years old. Later, she was held up in a \u201cflash kidnapping\u201d with her 5-year-old son in the car. They were driven around for two hours while armed teenagers forced them to take cash out of A.T.M.s. Still, she staunchly opposes allowing citizens to carry guns, arguing that being armed would not have helped her.\\r\\n<br>\u201cI was caught by surprise every single time,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t want some \u2018good citizen\u2019 deciding to step in with a gun. I don\u2019t want someone making that decision for me \u2014 the risk is too big.\u201d\\r\\n<br>A number of proposals backed by the \u201cbullet lobby,\u201d a group of lawmakers, have been introduced in Congress in an effort to relax gun restrictions. Within days of Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s victory, representatives keen on impressing the president-elect pushed to vote on a bill, first introduced in 2012, that would lower the age limit for gun ownership to 21 and would not require applicants to prove the need to be armed.\\r\\n<p>It appears likely that they will vote on the bill after Jan. 1, when Mr. Bolsonaro and his new allies in Congress take office. Conservatives from his Social Liberal Party won 52 seats, up from eight, making it the second largest party in the lower house.\\r\\n<br>Stocks in the Brazilian firearm manufacturer Forjas Taurus surged more than 400 percent ahead of the presidential elections on expectations that a Bolsonaro victory would pave the way for a boom in sales, although financial concerns over the company have since eroded some of those gains.\\r\\n<br>The euphoria surrounding Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s rise in polls also prompted a flood of phone calls to the Centaurus shooting academy from people interested in courses, guidance on how laws could change, or target practice at its two-story house converted into a classroom and four-lane shooting range.\\r\\n<p>\u201cThere has been a big surge in demand thanks to my man, Bolsonaro,\u201d said Nelson de Oliveira Jr., a former police officer who opened the Centaurus shooting academy in S\u00e3o Paulo in 2003, just before Brazil\u2019s then left-wing government introduced the Disarmament Statute.\\r\\n<br>Among them are the Ortegas, who signed up for gun training at the shooting academy and see the ability to carry a weapon as a deterrent to the kind of armed robbery Ms. Ortega says she suffered two months before Mr. Bolsonaro was elected.\\r\\n<br>\u201cRight now, only the criminals have guns,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to run around the streets with a gun in my hand, but a criminal might think twice if normal citizens could be armed.\u201d\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"world.2.txt\",\"id\":-589719920},{\"title\":\"NASA\u2019s InSight Mission Has Touched Down on Mars to Study the Red Planet\u2019s Deep Secrets\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"In the months ahead, the spacecraft will begin its study of the Martian underworld, listening for marsquakes and seeking clues about the dusty world\u2019s formation.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>The InSight lander, NASA\u2019s latest foray to the red planet, has landed.\\r\\n<br>Cheers erupted on Monday at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., which operates the spacecraft, when InSight sent back acknowledgment of its safe arrival on Mars.

Once the mission\u2019s managers have confirmed the health of the spacecraft, including its robotic arm, the arm will lift the spacecraft\u2019s primary instruments off the main deck of the lander and place them on the Martian ground. \\r\\n<p>Elizabeth Barrett, a science system engineer, likened the process to a claw game where one tries to pull out a prize without it falling. \u201cBut you\u2019re doing it with a really, really valuable prize,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re doing it blindfolded where you can only take occasional pictures. And then you\u2019re doing it via remote control on another planet.\u201d\\r\\n<br>That requires some additional care. \u201cYou need to make sure you actually have the grapple on the payload before you lift it up and it\u2019s actually on the ground before you let it go,\u201d Dr. Barrett said.\\r\\n<br>InSight\u2019s primary mission on the surface is to last nearly two years. \\r\\n<br>One simple thing Dr. Banerdt hopes to learn: how thick is the crust of Mars?\\r\\n<br>He recalled a project he worked on as an intern in the 1970s where the thickness of Mars\u2019s crust needed to be known. \u201cWe just had to fake it, because we had no idea,\u201d he said. \\r\\n<br>InSight should finally provide the answer. \u201cThat\u2019s one measurement I would like to go back to the old paper, plug it in to see how close I was,\u201d Dr. Banerdt said.\\r\\n<br>Other questions the mission aims to answer: How often does the ground shake with marsquakes? How big is Mars\u2019s molten core? How much heat is flowing up from the decay of radioactive elements at the core?\\r\\n<p>To study these questions, InSight will use two main instruments: a dome-shape package containing seismometers and a heat probe that is to burrow about 16 feet down. NASA has spent $814 million on InSight. In addition, France and Germany invested $180 million to build these main instruments.\\r\\n<br>The seismometers, which are designed to measure surface movements less than the width of a hydrogen atom, will produce what are essentially sonograms of the planet\u2019s insides. In particular, scientists are looking to record at least 10 to 12 marsquakes over two years.\\r\\n<br>Temblors on Mars are not caused by plate tectonics, like on Earth. Instead they are generated when the planet\u2019s crust cracks because of its interior\u2019s cooling and shrinking. The seismometers could also detect other seismic vibrations from meteors hitting Mars. \\r\\n<p>InSight\u2019s landing wasn\u2019t NASA\u2019s only success on Monday. The agency used the mission to test new technology.\\r\\n<br>Two identical spacecraft known as Mars Cube One, or MarCO for short, launched with InSight in May.

A sole proprietor has unlimited liability for all obligations incurred by the business, whether from operating costs or judgments against the business. All assets of the business belong to a sole proprietor, including, for example, computer infrastructure, any inventory, manufacturing equipment, or retail fixtures, as well as any real property owned by the sole proprietor.\\r\\nPartnership: A partnership is a business owned by two or more people. In most forms of partnerships, each partner has unlimited liability for the debts incurred by the business. The three most prevalent types of for-profit partnerships are: general partnerships, limited partnerships, and limited liability partnerships.[6]\\r\\nCorporation: The owners of a corporation have limited liability and the business has a separate legal personality from its owners. Corporations can be either government-owned or privately owned. They can organize either for profit or as nonprofit organizations. A privately owned, for-profit corporation is owned by its shareholders, who elect a board of directors to direct the corporation and hire its managerial staff. A privately owned, for-profit corporation can be either privately held by a small group of individuals, or publicly held, with publicly traded shares listed on a stock exchange.\\r\\nCooperative: Often referred to as a \\\"co-op\\\", a cooperative is a limited-liability business that can organize as for-profit or not-for-profit. A cooperative differs from a corporation in that it has members, not shareholders, and they share decision-making authority. Cooperatives are typically classified as either consumer cooperatives or worker cooperatives. Cooperatives are fundamental to the ideology of economic democracy.\\r\\nLimited liability companies (LLC), limited liability partnerships, and other specific types of business organization protect their owners or shareholders from business failure by doing business under a separate legal entity with certain legal protections. In contrast, unincorporated businesses or persons working on their own are usually not as protected.[7][8]\\r\\nFranchises: A franchise is a system in which entrepreneurs purchase the rights to open and run a business from a larger corporation.[9] Franchising in the United States is widespread and is a major economic powerhouse. One out of twelve retail businesses in the United States are franchised and 8 million people are employed in a franchised business.[10]\\r\\nA company limited by guarantee: Commonly used where companies are formed for noncommercial purposes, such as clubs or charities. The members guarantee the payment of certain (usually nominal) amounts if the company goes into insolvent liquidation, but otherwise, they have no economic rights in relation to the company. This type of company is common in England. A company limited by guarantee may be with or without having share capital.\\r\\nA company limited by shares: The most common form of the company used for business ventures. Specifically, a limited company is a \\\"company in which the liability of each shareholder is limited to the amount individually invested\\\" with corporations being \\\"the most common example of a limited company.\\\"[11] This type of company is common in England and many English-speaking countries. A company limited by shares may be a\\r\\npublicly traded company or a\\r\\nprivately held company\\r\\nA company limited by guarantee with a share capital: A hybrid entity, usually used where the company is formed for noncommercial purposes, but the activities of the company are partly funded by investors who expect a return. This type of company may no longer be formed in the UK, although provisions still exist in law for them to exist.[12]\\r\\nA limited liability company: \\\"A company\ufffdstatutorily authorized in certain states\ufffdthat is characterized by limited liability, management by members or managers, and limitations on ownership transfer\\\", i.e., L.L.C.[11] LLC structure has been called \\\"hybrid\\\" in that it \\\"combines the characteristics of a corporation and of a partnership or sole proprietorship\\\". Like a corporation, it has limited liability for members of the company, and like a partnership it has \\\"flow-through taxation to the members\\\" and must be \\\"dissolved upon the death or bankruptcy of a member\\\".[13]\\r\\nAn unlimited company with or without a share capital: A hybrid entity, a company where the liability of members or shareholders for the debts (if any) of the company are not limited. In this case doctrine of a veil of incorporation does not apply.\\r\\nLess common types of companies are:\\r\\n\\r\\nCompanies formed by letters patent: Most corporations by letters patent are corporations sole and not companies as the term is commonly understood today.\\r\\nCharter corporations: Before the passing of modern companies legislation, these were the only types of companies. Now they are relatively rare, except for very old companies that still survive (of which there are still many, particularly many British banks), or modern societies that fulfill a quasi-regulatory function (for example, the Bank of England is a corporation formed by a modern charter).\\r\\nStatutory companies: Relatively rare today, certain companies have been formed by a private statute passed in the relevant jurisdiction.\\r\\nNote that \\\"Ltd after the company's name signifies limited company, and PLC (public limited company) indicates that its shares are widely held.\\\"[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn legal parlance, the owners of a company are normally referred to as the \\\"members\\\". In a company limited or unlimited by shares (formed or incorporated with a share capital), this will be the shareholders. In a company limited by guarantee, this will be the guarantors. Some offshore jurisdictions have created special forms of offshore company in a bid to attract business for their jurisdictions. Examples include \\\"segregated portfolio companies\\\" and restricted purpose companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are, however, many, many sub-categories of types of company that can be formed in various jurisdictions in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompanies are also sometimes distinguished for legal and regulatory purposes between public companies and private companies. Public companies are companies whose shares can be publicly traded, often (although not always) on a stock exchange which imposes listing requirements\/Listing Rules as to the issued shares, the trading of shares and future issue of shares to help bolster the reputation of the exchange or particular market of an exchange. Private companies do not have publicly traded shares, and often contain restrictions on transfers of shares. In some jurisdictions, private companies have maximum numbers of shareholders.\\r\\n\\r\\nA parent company is a company that owns enough voting stock in another firm to control management and operations by influencing or electing its board of directors; the second company being deemed as a subsidiary of the parent company. The definition of a parent company differs by jurisdiction, with the definition normally being defined by way of laws dealing with companies in that jurisdiction.\\r\\n\\r\\nClassifications\\r\\nMain article: Industry classification\\r\\nAgriculture, such as the domestication of fish, animals and livestock, as well as lumber, oil and mining businesses that extract natural resources and raw materials, such as wood, petroleum, natural gas, ores, plants or minerals.\\r\\nFinancial services businesses include banks, brokerage firms, credit unions, credit cards, insurance companies, asset and investment companies such as private equity firms, private equity funds, real estate investment trusts, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, mutual funds, index funds, and hedge funds, stock exchanges, and other companies that generate profits through investment and management of capital.\\r\\nEntertainment companies and mass media agencies generate profits primarily from the sale of intellectual property. They include film studios and production houses, mass media companies such as cable television networks, online digital media agencies, talent agencies, mobile media outlets, newspapers, book and magazine publishing houses.\\r\\nIndustrial manufacturers produce products, either from raw materials or from component parts, then export the finished products at a profit. They include tangible goods such as cars, buses, medical devices, glass, or aircraft.\\r\\nReal estate businesses sell, invest, construct and develop properties, including land, residential homes, and other buildings.\\r\\nRetailers, wholesalers, and distributors act as middlemen and get goods produced by manufacturers to the intended consumers; they make their profits by marking up their prices. Most stores and catalog companies are distributors or retailers.\\r\\nTransportation businesses such as railways, airlines, shipping companies that deliver goods and individuals to their destinations for a fee.\\r\\nUtilities produce public services such as water, electricity, waste management or sewage treatment. These industries are usually operated under the charge of a public government.\\r\\nService businesses offer intangible goods or services and typically charge for labor or other services provided to government, to consumers, or to other businesses. Interior decorators, beauticians, hairstylists, make-up artists, tanning salons, laundromats, dry cleaners, and pest controllers are service businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nActivities\\r\\nAccounting\\r\\nMain article: Accounting\\r\\nAccounting is the measurement, processing and communication of financial information about economic entities[15][16] such as businesses and corporations. The modern field was established by the Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli in 1494.[17] Accounting, which has been called the \\\"language of business\\\",[18] measures the results of an organization's economic activities and conveys this information to a variety of users, including investors, creditors, management, and regulators.[19] Practitioners of accounting are known as accountants. The terms \\\"accounting\\\" and \\\"financial reporting\\\" are often used as synonyms.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinance\\r\\nMain article: Finance\\r\\nFinance is a field that deals with the study of investments. It includes the dynamics of assets and liabilities over time under conditions of different degrees of uncertainty and risk. Finance can also be defined as the science of money management. Finance aims to price assets based on their risk level and their expected rate of return. Finance can be broken into three different sub-categories: public finance, corporate finance and personal finance.\\r\\n\\r\\nManufacturing\\r\\nMain article: Manufacturing\\r\\nManufacturing is the production of merchandise for use or sale using labour and machines, tools, chemical and biological processing, or formulation. The term may refer to a range of human activity, from handicraft to high tech, but is most commonly applied to industrial production, in which raw materials are transformed into finished goods on a large scale.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarketing\\r\\nMain article: Marketing\\r\\nMarketing is defined by the American Marketing Association as \\\"the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.\\\"[20] The term developed from the original meaning which referred literally to going to a market to buy or sell goods or services. Marketing tactics include advertising as well as determining product pricing.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the rise in technology, marketing is further divided into a class called digital marketing. It is marketing products and services using digital technologies.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch and development\\r\\nMain article: Research and development\\r\\nResearch and development refer to activities in connection with corporate or government innovation. Research and development constitute the first stage of development of a potential new service or product. Research and development are very difficult to manage since the defining feature of the research is that the researchers do not know in advance exactly how to accomplish the desired result.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSafety\\r\\nMain article: Safety\\r\\nSafety is a key business concept that is defined by Merriam-Webster as \ufffdthe condition of being safe from undergoing or causing hurt, injury, or loss\ufffd.[21] Injuries cost businesses billions of dollars annually.[22] Studies have shown how company acceptance and implementation of comprehensive safety and health management systems reduces incidents, insurance costs and workers\ufffd compensation claims.[23] New technologies, like wearable safety devices[24] and available online safety training, continue to be developed to encourage employers to invest in protection beyond the \\\"canary in the coalmine\\\" and reduce the cost to businesses of protecting their employees.\\r\\n\\r\\nSales\\r\\nMain article: Sales\\r\\nSales are activity related to selling or the amount of goods or services sold in a given time period. Sales are often integrated with all lines of business and are key to a companies' success.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganization and regulation\\r\\nSee also: Theory of the firm\\r\\nMost legal jurisdictions specify the forms of ownership that a business can take, creating a body of commercial law for each type.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major factors affecting how a business is organized are usually:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe size and scope of the business firm and its structure, management, and ownership, broadly analyzed in the theory of the firm. Generally, a smaller business is more flexible, while larger businesses, or those with wider ownership or more formal structures, will usually tend to be organized as corporations or (less often) partnerships. In addition, a business that wishes to raise money on a stock market or to be owned by a wide range of people will often be required to adopt a specific legal form to do so.\\r\\nThe sector and country. Private profit-making businesses are different from government-owned bodies. In some countries, certain businesses are legally obliged to be organized in certain ways.\\r\\nTax advantages. Different structures are treated differently in tax law and may have advantages for this reason.\\r\\nDisclosure and compliance requirements. Different business structures may be required to make less or more information public (or report it to relevant authorities) and may be bound to comply with different rules and regulations.\\r\\nMany businesses are operated through a separate entity such as a corporation or a partnership (either formed with or without limited liability). Most legal jurisdictions allow people to organize such an entity by filing certain charter documents with the relevant Secretary of State or equivalent and complying with certain other ongoing obligations. The relationships and legal rights of shareholders, limited partners, or members are governed partly by the charter documents and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the entity is organized. Generally speaking, shareholders in a corporation, limited partners in a limited partnership, and members in a limited liability company are shielded from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the entity, which is legally treated as a separate \\\"person\\\". This means that unless there is misconduct, the owner's own possessions are strongly protected in law if the business does not succeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere two or more individuals own a business together but have failed to organize a more specialized form of vehicle, they will be treated as a general partnership. The terms of a partnership are partly governed by a partnership agreement if one is created, and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. No paperwork or filing is necessary to create a partnership, and without an agreement, the relationships and legal rights of the partners will be entirely governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. A single person who owns and runs a business is commonly known as a sole proprietor, whether that person owns it directly or through a formally organized entity. Depending on the business needs, an adviser can decide what kind is proprietorship will be most suitable.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few relevant factors to consider in deciding how to operate a business include:\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral partners in a partnership (other than a limited liability partnership), plus anyone who personally owns and operates a business without creating a separate legal entity, are personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business.\\r\\nGenerally, corporations are required to pay tax just like \\\"real\\\" people. In some tax systems, this can give rise to so-called double taxation, because first the corporation pays tax on the profit, and then when the corporation distributes its profits to its owners, individuals have to include dividends in their income when they complete their personal tax returns, at which point a second layer of income tax is imposed.\\r\\nIn most countries, there are laws which treat small corporations differently from large ones. They may be exempt from certain legal filing requirements or labor laws, have simplified procedures in specialized areas, and have simplified, advantageous, or slightly different tax treatment.\\r\\n\\\"Going public\\\" through a process known as an initial public offering (IPO) means that part of the business will be owned by members of the public. This requires the organization as a distinct entity, to disclose information to the public, and adhering to a tighter set of laws and procedures. Most public entities are corporations that have sold shares, but increasingly there are also public LLC's that sell units (sometimes also called shares), and other more exotic entities as well, such as, for example, real estate investment trusts in the USA, and unit trusts in the UK. A general partnership cannot \\\"go public\\\".\\r\\nCommercial law\\r\\nMain article: Corporate law\\r\\n\\r\\nOffices in the Los Angeles Downtown Financial District\\r\\nA very detailed and well-established body of rules that evolved over a very long period of time applies to commercial transactions. The need to regulate trade and commerce and resolve business disputes helped shape the creation of law and courts. The Code of Hammurabi dates back to about 1772 BC for example, and contains provisions that relate, among other matters, to shipping costs and dealings between merchants and brokers.[27] The word \\\"corporation\\\" derives from the Latin corpus, meaning body, and the Maurya Empire in Iron-Age India accorded legal rights to business entities.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many countries, it is difficult to compile all the laws that can affect a business into a single reference source. Laws can govern treatment of labour and employee relations, worker protection and safety, discrimination on the basis of age, gender, disability, race, and in some jurisdictions, sexual orientation, and the minimum wage, as well as unions, worker compensation, and working hours and leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome specialized businesses may also require licenses, either due to laws governing entry into certain trades, occupations or professions, that require special education or to raise revenue for local governments. Professions that require special licenses include law, medicine, piloting aircraft, selling liquor, radio broadcasting, selling investment securities, selling used cars, and roofing. Local jurisdictions may also require special licenses and taxes just to operate a business.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome businesses are subject to ongoing special regulation, for example, public utilities, investment securities, banking, insurance, broadcasting, aviation, and health care providers. Environmental regulations are also very complex and can affect many businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nCapital\\r\\n\\r\\nMexican Stock Exchange in Paseo de la Reforma, Mexico City\\r\\nWhen businesses need to raise money (called capital), they sometimes offer securities for sale.\\r\\n\\r\\nCapital may be raised through private means, by an initial public offering or IPO on a stock exchange, or in other ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor stock exchanges include the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Singapore Exchange, Hong Kong Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ (the USA), the London Stock Exchange (UK), the Tokyo Stock Exchange (Japan), and Bombay Stock Exchange (India). Most countries with capital markets have at least one.\\r\\n\\r\\nBusinesses that have gone public are subject to regulations concerning their internal governance, such as how executive officers' compensation is determined, and when and how information is disclosed to shareholders and to the public. In the United States, these regulations are primarily implemented and enforced by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Other western nations have comparable regulatory bodies. The regulations are implemented and enforced by the China Securities Regulation Commission (CSRC) in China. In Singapore, the regulatory authority is the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and in Hong Kong, it is the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proliferation and increasing complexity of the laws governing business have forced increasing specialization in corporate law. It is not unheard of for certain kinds of corporate transactions to require a team of five to ten attorneys due to sprawling regulation. Commercial law spans general corporate law, employment and labor law, health-care law, securities law, mergers and acquisitions, tax law, employee benefit plans, food and drug regulation, intellectual property law on copyrights, patents, trademarks, telecommunications law, and financing.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther types of capital sourcing include crowdsourcing on the Internet, venture capital, bank loans, and debentures.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntellectual property\\r\\nMain article: Intellectual property\\r\\nBusinesses often have important \\\"intellectual property\\\" that needs protection from competitors for the company to stay profitable. This could require patents, copyrights, trademarks, or preservation of trade secrets. Most businesses have names, logos, and similar branding techniques that could benefit from trademarking. Patents and copyrights in the United States are largely governed by federal law, while trade secrets and trademarking are mostly a matter of state law. Because of the nature of intellectual property, a business needs protection in every jurisdiction in which they are concerned about competitors. Many countries are signatories to international treaties concerning intellectual property, and thus companies registered in these countries are subject to national laws bound by these treaties. In order to protect trade secrets, companies may require employees to sign noncompete clauses which will impose limitations on an employee's interactions with stakeholders, and competitors.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrade union\\r\\nMain article: Trade union\\r\\nA trade union (or labor union) is an organization of workers who have come together to achieve common goals such as protecting the integrity of its trade, improving safety standards, achieving higher pay and benefits such as health care and retirement, increasing the number of employees an employer assigns to complete the work, and better working conditions. The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members (rank and file members) and negotiates labor contracts (collective bargaining) with employers. The most common purpose of these associations or unions is \\\"maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment\\\".[29] This may include the negotiation of wages, work rules, complaint procedures, rules governing hiring, firing, and promotion of workers, benefits, workplace safety and policies.\",\"evals\":[],\"id\":643957705},{\"title\":\"health\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"See also: Social determinants of health and Risk factor\\rGenerally, the context in which an individual lives is of great importance for both his health status and quality of their life[18].

It is increasingly recognized that health is maintained and improved not only through the advancement and application of health science, but also through the efforts and intelligent lifestyle choices of the individual and society. According to the World Health Organization, the main determinants of health include the social and economic environment, the physical environment and the person's individual characteristics and behaviors.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nMore specifically, key factors that have been found to influence whether people are healthy or unhealthy include the following:[19][20][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIncome and social status\\r\\nSocial support networks\\r\\nEducation and literacy\\r\\nEmployment\/working conditions\\r\\nSocial environments\\r\\nPhysical environments\\r\\nPersonal health practices and coping skills\\r\\nHealthy child development\\r\\nBiology and genetics\\r\\nHealth care services\\r\\nGender\\r\\nCulture\\r\\n\\r\\nDonald Henderson as part of the CDC's smallpox eradication team in 1966.\\r\\nAn increasing number of studies and reports from different organizations and contexts examine the linkages between health and different factors, including lifestyles, environments, health care organization and health policy, one specific health policy brought into many countries in recent years was the introduction of the sugar tax. Beverage taxes came into light with increasing concerns about obesity, particularly among youth. Sugar-sweetened beverages have become a target of anti-obesity initiatives with increasing evidence of their link to obesity.[22]\ufffd such as the 1974 Lalonde report from Canada;[21] the Alameda County Study in California;[23] and the series of World Health Reports of the World Health Organization, which focuses on global health issues including access to health care and improving public health outcomes, especially in developing countries.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe concept of the \\\"health field,\\\" as distinct from medical care, emerged from the Lalonde report from Canada. The report identified three interdependent fields as key determinants of an individual's health. These are:[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nLifestyle: the aggregation of personal decisions (i.e., over which the individual has control) that can be said to contribute to, or cause, illness or death;\\r\\nEnvironmental: all matters related to health external to the human body and over which the individual has little or no control;\\r\\nBiomedical: all aspects of health, physical and mental, developed within the human body as influenced by genetic make-up.\\r\\nThe maintenance and promotion of health is achieved through different combination of physical, mental, and social well-being, together sometimes referred to as the \\\"health triangle.\\\"[25][26] The WHO's 1986 Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion further stated that health is not just a state, but also \\\"a resource for everyday life, not the objective of living. Health is a positive concept emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities.\\\"[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nFocusing more on lifestyle issues and their relationships with functional health, data from the Alameda County Study suggested that people can improve their health via exercise, enough sleep, maintaining a healthy body weight, limiting alcohol use, and avoiding smoking.[28] Health and illness can co-exist, as even people with multiple chronic diseases or terminal illnesses can consider themselves healthy.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe environment is often cited as an important factor influencing the health status of individuals. This includes characteristics of the natural environment, the built environment and the social environment. Factors such as clean water and air, adequate housing, and safe communities and roads all have been found to contribute to good health, especially to the health of infants and children.[19][30] Some studies have shown that a lack of neighborhood recreational spaces including natural environment leads to lower levels of personal satisfaction and higher levels of obesity, linked to lower overall health and well being.[31] This suggests that the positive health benefits of natural space in urban neighborhoods should be taken into account in public policy and land use.\\r\\n\\r\\nGenetics, or inherited traits from parents, also play a role in determining the health status of individuals and populations. This can encompass both the predisposition to certain diseases and health conditions, as well as the habits and behaviors individuals develop through the lifestyle of their families. For example, genetics may play a role in the manner in which people cope with stress, either mental, emotional or physical. For example, obesity is a significant problem in the United States that contributes to bad mental health and causes stress in the lives of great numbers of people[32]. (One difficulty is the issue raised by the debate over the relative strengths of genetics and other factors; interactions between genetics and environment may be of particular importance.)\\r\\n\\r\\nPotential issues\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of types of health issues are common around the globe. Disease is one of the most common. According to GlobalIssues.org, approximately 36 million people die each year from non-communicable (not contagious) disease including cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic lung disease (Shah, 2014).\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong communicable diseases, both viral and bacterial, AIDS\/HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria are the most common, causing millions of deaths every year (Shah, 2014).\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother health issue that causes death or contributes to other health problems is malnutrition, especially among children. One of the groups malnutrition affects most is young children. Approximately 7.5 million children under the age of 5 die from malnutrition, usually brought on by not having the money to find or make food (Shah, 2014).\\r\\n\\r\\nBodily injuries are also a common health issue worldwide. These injuries, including broken bones, fractures, and burns can reduce a person's quality of life or can cause fatalities including infections that resulted from the injury or the severity injury in general (Moffett, 2013).[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nLifestyle choices are contributing factors to poor health in many cases. These include smoking cigarettes, and can also include a poor diet, whether it is overeating or an overly constrictive diet. Inactivity can also contribute to health issues and also a lack of sleep, excessive alcohol consumption, and neglect of oral hygiene (Moffett2013).There are also genetic disorders that are inherited by the person and can vary in how much they affect the person and when they surface (Moffett, 2013).\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the majority of these health issues are preventable, a major contributor to global ill health is the fact that approximately 1 billion people lack access to health care systems (Shah, 2014). Arguably, the most common and harmful health issue is that a great many people do not have access to quality remedies.[34][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nMental health\\r\\nMain article: Mental health\\r\\nThe World Health Organization describes mental health as \\\"a state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community\\\".[36] Mental Health is not just the absence of mental illness.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nMental illness is described as 'the spectrum of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral conditions that interfere with social and emotional well-being and the lives and productivity of people. Having a mental illness can seriously impair, temporarily or permanently, the mental functioning of a person. Other terms include: 'mental health problem', 'illness', 'disorder', 'dysfunction'.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nRoughly a quarter of all adults 18 and over in the US are considered diagnosable with mental illness. Mental illnesses are the leading cause of disability in the US and Canada. Examples include, schizophrenia, ADHD, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and autism.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany teens suffer from mental health issues in response to the pressures of society and social problems they encounter. Some of the key mental health issues seen in teens are: depression, eating disorders, and drug abuse. There are many ways to prevent these health issues from occurring such as communicating well with a teen suffering from mental health issues. Mental health can be treated and be attentive to teens' behavior.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\n Many factors contribute to mental health problems, including:\\r\\n\\r\\nBiological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry\\r\\nLife experiences, such as trauma or abuse\\r\\nFamily history of mental health problems\\r\\nMaintaining\\r\\nAchieving and maintaining health is an ongoing process, shaped by both the evolution of health care knowledge and practices as well as personal strategies and organized interventions for staying healthy.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet\\r\\nMain articles: Healthy diet and Human nutrition\\r\\n\\r\\nPercentage of overweight or obese population in 2010, Data source: OECD's iLibrary, http:\/\/stats.oecd.org[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nPercentage of obese population in 2010, Data source: OECD's iLibrary, http:\/\/stats.oecd.org[42]\\r\\nAn important way to maintain your personal health is to have a healthy diet. A healthy diet includes a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods that provide nutrients to your body. Such nutrients give you energy and keep your body running. Nutrients help build and strengthen bones, muscles, and tendons and also regulate body processes (i.e. blood pressure). The food guide pyramid is a pyramid-shaped guide of healthy foods divided into sections. Each section shows the recommended intake for each food group (i.e. Protein, Fat, Carbohydrates, and Sugars). Making healthy food choices is important because it can lower your risk of heart disease, developing some types of cancer, and it will contribute to maintaining a healthy weight.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mediterranean diet is commonly associated with health-promoting effects due to the fact that it contains some bioactive compounds like phenolic compounds, isoprenoids and alkaloids.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nExercise\\r\\nMain article: Exercise\\r\\nPhysical exercise enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness. It strengthens muscles and improves the cardiovascular system. According to the National Institutes of Health, there are four types of exercise: endurance, strength, flexibility, and balance.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nSleep\\r\\nMain articles: Sleep and Sleep deprivation\\r\\nSleep is an essential component to maintaining health. In children, sleep is also vital for growth and development. Ongoing sleep deprivation has been linked to an increased risk for some chronic health problems. In addition, sleep deprivation has been shown to correlate with both increased susceptibility to illness and slower recovery times from illness.[46] In one study, people with chronic insufficient sleep, set as six hours of sleep a night or less, were found to be four times more likely to catch a cold compared to those who reported sleeping for seven hours or more a night.[47] Due to the role of sleep in regulating metabolism, insufficient sleep may also play a role in weight gain or, conversely, in impeding weight loss.[48] Additionally, in 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is the cancer research agency for the World Health Organization, declared that \\\"shiftwork that involves circadian disruption is probably carcinogenic to humans,\\\" speaking to the dangers of long-term nighttime work due to its intrusion on sleep.[49] In 2015, the National Sleep Foundation released updated recommendations for sleep duration requirements based on age and concluded that \\\"Individuals who habitually sleep outside the normal range may be exhibiting signs or symptoms of serious health problems or, if done volitionally, may be compromising their health and well-being.\\\"[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nRole of science\\r\\nMain articles: Health science and Health care\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dutch Public Health Service provides medical care for the natives of the Dutch East Indies, May 1946\\r\\nHealth science is the branch of science focused on health. There are two main approaches to health science: the study and research of the body and health-related issues to understand how humans (and animals) function, and the application of that knowledge to improve health and to prevent and cure diseases and other physical and mental impairments. The science builds on many sub-fields, including biology, biochemistry, physics, epidemiology, pharmacology, medical sociology. Applied health sciences endeavor to better understand and improve human health through applications in areas such as health education, biomedical engineering, biotechnology and public health.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganized interventions to improve health based on the principles and procedures developed through the health sciences are provided by practitioners trained in medicine, nursing, nutrition, pharmacy, social work, psychology, occupational therapy, physical therapy and other health care professions. Clinical practitioners focus mainly on the health of individuals, while public health practitioners consider the overall health of communities and populations. Workplace wellness programs are increasingly adopted by companies for their value in improving the health and well-being of their employees, as are school health services in order to improve the health and well-being of children.\\r\\n\\r\\nRole of public health\\r\\nMain article: Public health\\r\\nSee also: Global health\\r\\n\\r\\nPostage stamp, New Zealand, 1933. Public health has been promoted \ufffd and depicted \ufffd in a wide variety of ways.\\r\\nPublic health has been described as \\\"the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations, public and private, communities and individuals.\\\"[51] It is concerned with threats to the overall health of a community based on population health analysis. The population in question can be as small as a handful of people or as large as all the inhabitants of several continents (for instance, in the case of a pandemic). Public health has many sub-fields, but typically includes the interdisciplinary categories of epidemiology, biostatistics and health services. Environmental health, community health, behavioral health, and occupational health are also important areas of public health.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe focus of public health interventions is to prevent and manage diseases, injuries and other health conditions through surveillance of cases and the promotion of healthy behavior, communities, and (in aspects relevant to human health) environments. Its aim is to prevent health problems from happening or re-occurring by implementing educational programs, developing policies, administering services and conducting research.[52] In many cases, treating a disease or controlling a pathogen can be vital to preventing it in others, such as during an outbreak. Vaccination programs and distribution of condoms to prevent the spread of communicable diseases are examples of common preventive public health measures, as are educational campaigns to promote vaccination and the use of condoms (including overcoming resistance to such).\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic health also takes various actions to limit the health disparities between different areas of the country and, in some cases, the continent or world. One issue is the access of individuals and communities to health care in terms of financial, geographical or socio-cultural constraints to accessing and using services.[53] Applications of the public health system include the areas of maternal and child health, health services administration, emergency response, and prevention and control of infectious and chronic diseases.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great positive impact of public health programs is widely acknowledged. Due in part to the policies and actions developed through public health, the 20th century registered a decrease in the mortality rates for infants and children and a continual increase in life expectancy in most parts of the world. For example, it is estimated that life expectancy has increased for Americans by thirty years since 1900,[54] and worldwide by six years since 1990.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nSelf-care strategies\\r\\nMain article: Self care\\r\\nSee also: Chronic care management, Social relation, and Stress management\\r\\n\\r\\nA lady washing her hands c. 1655\\r\\nPersonal health depends partially on the active, passive, and assisted cues people observe and adopt about their own health. These include personal actions for preventing or minimizing the effects of a disease, usually a chronic condition, through integrative care. They also include personal hygiene practices to prevent infection and illness, such as bathing and washing hands with soap; brushing and flossing teeth; storing, preparing and handling food safely; and many others. The information gleaned from personal observations of daily living \ufffd such as about sleep patterns, exercise behavior, nutritional intake and environmental features \ufffd may be used to inform personal decisions and actions (e.g., \\\"I feel tired in the morning so I am going to try sleeping on a different pillow\\\"), as well as clinical decisions and treatment plans (e.g., a patient who notices his or her shoes are tighter than usual may be having exacerbation of left-sided heart failure, and may require diuretic medication to reduce fluid overload).[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonal health also depends partially on the social structure of a person's life. The maintenance of strong social relationships, volunteering, and other social activities have been linked to positive mental health and also increased longevity. One American study among seniors over age 70, found that frequent volunteering was associated with reduced risk of dying compared with older persons who did not volunteer, regardless of physical health status.[57] Another study from Singapore reported that volunteering retirees had significantly better cognitive performance scores, fewer depressive symptoms, and better mental well-being and life satisfaction than non-volunteering retirees.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nProlonged psychological stress may negatively impact health, and has been cited as a factor in cognitive impairment with aging, depressive illness, and expression of disease.[59] Stress management is the application of methods to either reduce stress or increase tolerance to stress. Relaxation techniques are physical methods used to relieve stress. Psychological methods include cognitive therapy, meditation, and positive thinking, which work by reducing response to stress. Improving relevant skills, such as problem solving and time management skills, reduces uncertainty and builds confidence, which also reduces the reaction to stress-causing situations where those skills are applicable.\\r\\n\\r\\nOccupational\\r\\nMain article: Occupational safety and health\\r\\nIn addition to safety risks, many jobs also present risks of disease, illness and other long-term health problems. Among the most common occupational diseases are various forms of pneumoconiosis, including silicosis and coal worker's pneumoconiosis (black lung disease). Asthma is another respiratory illness that many workers are vulnerable to. Workers may also be vulnerable to skin diseases, including eczema, dermatitis, urticaria, sunburn, and skin cancer.[60][61] Other occupational diseases of concern include carpal tunnel syndrome and lead poisoning.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the number of service sector jobs has risen in developed countries, more and more jobs have become sedentary, presenting a different array of health problems than those associated with manufacturing and the primary sector. Contemporary problems, such as the growing rate of obesity and issues relating to stress and overwork in many countries, have further complicated the interaction between work and health.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany governments view occupational health as a social challenge and have formed public organizations to ensure the health and safety of workers. Examples of these include the British Health and Safety Executive and in the United States, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which conducts research on occupational health and safety, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which handles regulation and policy relating to worker safety and health.[62][63][64]\",\"evals\":[],\"id\":-1897987410},{\"title\":\"science\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"The earliest roots of science can be traced to Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3500 to 3000 BCE.[3][4] Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal ...\",\"content\":\"Science (from Latin scientia, meaning \\\"knowledge\\\")[1] is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.[2][a]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest roots of science can be traced to Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3500 to 3000 BCE.[3][4] Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to explain events of the physical world based on natural causes.[3][4] After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, knowledge of Greek conceptions of the world deteriorated in Western Europe during the early centuries (400 to 1000 CE) of the Middle Ages[5] but was preserved in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age.[6] The recovery and assimilation of Greek works and Islamic inquiries into Western Europe from the 10th to 13th century revived natural philosophy,[5][7] which was later transformed by the Scientific Revolution that began in the 16th century[8] as new ideas and discoveries departed from previous Greek conceptions and traditions.[9][10][11][12] The scientific method soon played a greater role in knowledge creation and it was not until the 19th century that many of the institutional and professional features of science began to take shape.[13][14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nModern science is typically divided into three major branches that consist of the natural sciences (e.g., biology, chemistry, and physics), which study nature in the broadest sense; the social sciences (e.g., economics, psychology, and sociology), which study individuals and societies; and the formal sciences (e.g., logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science), which study abstract concepts. There is disagreement,[16][17] however, on whether the formal sciences actually constitute a science as they do not rely on empirical evidence.[18] Disciplines that utilize existing scientific knowledge for practical purposes, such as engineering and medicine, are described as applied sciences.[19][20][21][22]\\r\\n\\r\\nScience is based on research, which is commonly conducted in academic and research institutions as well as in government agencies and companies. The practical impact of scientific research has led to the emergence of science policies that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by prioritizing the development of commercial products, armaments, health care, and environmental protection.\\r\\n\\r\\nBranches of science\\r\\nMain article: Branches of science\\r\\nModern science is commonly divided into three major branches that consist of the natural sciences, social sciences, and formal sciences. Each of these branches comprise various specialized yet overlapping scientific disciplines that often possess their own nomenclature and expertise.[88] Both natural and social sciences are empirical sciences[89] as their knowledge are based on empirical observations and are capable of being tested for its validity by other researchers working under the same conditions.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also closely related disciplines that use science, such as engineering and medicine.\\r\\n\\r\\nNatural science\\r\\nMain articles: Natural science and Outline of natural science\\r\\n\\r\\nFalse-color composite of global oceanic and terrestrial photoautotroph abundance by the SeaWiFS Project, NASA\/Goddard Space Flight Center, and ORBIMAGE.\\r\\nNatural science is concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of natural phenomena based on empirical evidence from observation and experimentation. It can be divided into two main branches: life science (or biological science) and physical science. Physical science is subdivided into branches, including physics, chemistry, astronomy and earth science. These two branches may be further divided into more specialized disciplines. Modern natural science is the successor to the natural philosophy that began in Ancient Greece. Galileo, Descartes, Bacon, and Newton debated the benefits of using approaches which were more mathematical and more experimental in a methodical way. Still, philosophical perspectives, conjectures, and presuppositions, often overlooked, remain necessary in natural science.[91] Systematic data collection, including discovery science, succeeded natural history, which emerged in the 16th century by describing and classifying plants, animals, minerals, and so on.[92] Today, \\\"natural history\\\" suggests observational descriptions aimed at popular audiences.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nSocial science\\r\\nMain articles: Social science and Outline of social science\\r\\n\\r\\nIn economics, the supply and demand model describes how prices vary as a result of a balance between product availability and demand.\\r\\nSocial science is concerned with society and the relationships among individuals within a society. It has many branches that include, but are not limited to, anthropology, archaeology, communication studies, economics, history, human geography, jurisprudence, linguistics, political science, psychology, public health, and sociology. Social scientists may adopt various philosophical theories to study individuals and society. For example, positivist social scientists use methods resembling those of the natural sciences as tools for understanding society, and so define science in its stricter modern sense. Interpretivist social scientists, by contrast, may use social critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing empirically falsifiable theories, and thus treat science in its broader sense. In modern academic practice, researchers are often eclectic, using multiple methodologies (for instance, by combining both quantitative and qualitative research). The term \\\"social research\\\" has also acquired a degree of autonomy as practitioners from various disciplines share in its aims and methods.\\r\\n\\r\\nFormal science\\r\\nMain articles: Formal science and Outline of formal science\\r\\n\\r\\nA humanoid robotic hand (see Shadow Hand system).\\r\\nFormal science is involved in the study of formal systems. It includes mathematics,[94][95] systems theory, robotics, and theoretical computer science. The formal sciences share similarities with the other two branches by relying on objective, careful, and systematic study of an area of knowledge. They are, however, different from the empirical sciences as they rely exclusively on deductive reasoning, without the need for empirical evidence, to verify their abstract concepts.[18][96][97] The formal sciences are therefore a priori disciplines and because of this, there is disagreement on whether they actually constitute a science.[16][17] Nevertheless, the formal sciences play an important role in the empirical sciences. Calculus, for example, was initially invented to understand motion in physics.[98] Natural and social sciences that rely heavily on mathematical applications include mathematical physics, mathematical chemistry, mathematical biology, mathematical finance, and mathematical economics.\\r\\n\\r\\nScientific research\\r\\nSee also: Research\\r\\nScientific research can be labeled as either basic or applied research. Basic research is the search for knowledge and applied research is the search for solutions to practical problems using this knowledge. Although some scientific research is applied research into specific problems, a great deal of our understanding comes from the curiosity-driven undertaking of basic research. This leads to options for technological advance that were not planned or sometimes even imaginable. This point was made by Michael Faraday when allegedly in response to the question \\\"what is the use of basic research?\\\" he responded: \\\"Sir, what is the use of a new-born child?\\\".[99] For example, research into the effects of red light on the human eye's rod cells did not seem to have any practical purpose; eventually, the discovery that our night vision is not troubled by red light would lead search and rescue teams (among others) to adopt red light in the cockpits of jets and helicopters.[100]:106\ufffd10 Finally, even basic research can take unexpected turns, and there is some sense in which the scientific method is built to harness luck.\\r\\n\\r\\nScientific method\\r\\nMain article: Scientific method\\r\\n\\r\\nThe central star IRAS 10082-5647 was captured by the Advanced Camera for Surveys aboard the Hubble Space Telescope.\\r\\nScientific research involves using the scientific method, which seeks to objectively explain the events of nature in a reproducible way.[g] An explanatory thought experiment or hypothesis is put forward as explanation using principles such as parsimony (also known as \\\"Occam's Razor\\\") and are generally expected to seek consilience \ufffd fitting well with other accepted facts related to the phenomena.[101] This new explanation is used to make falsifiable predictions that are testable by experiment or observation. The predictions are to be posted before a confirming experiment or observation is sought, as proof that no tampering has occurred. Disproof of a prediction is evidence of progress.[h][i] This is done partly through observation of natural phenomena, but also through experimentation that tries to simulate natural events under controlled conditions as appropriate to the discipline (in the observational sciences, such as astronomy or geology, a predicted observation might take the place of a controlled experiment). Experimentation is especially important in science to help establish causal relationships (to avoid the correlation fallacy).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a hypothesis proves unsatisfactory, it is either modified or discarded.[102] If the hypothesis survived testing, it may become adopted into the framework of a scientific theory, a logically reasoned, self-consistent model or framework for describing the behavior of certain natural phenomena. A theory typically describes the behavior of much broader sets of phenomena than a hypothesis; commonly, a large number of hypotheses can be logically bound together by a single theory. Thus a theory is a hypothesis explaining various other hypotheses. In that vein, theories are formulated according to most of the same scientific principles as hypotheses. In addition to testing hypotheses, scientists may also generate a model, an attempt to describe or depict the phenomenon in terms of a logical, physical or mathematical representation and to generate new hypotheses that can be tested, based on observable phenomena.[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile performing experiments to test hypotheses, scientists may have a preference for one outcome over another, and so it is important to ensure that science as a whole can eliminate this bias.[104][105] This can be achieved by careful experimental design, transparency, and a thorough peer review process of the experimental results as well as any conclusions.[106][107] After the results of an experiment are announced or published, it is normal practice for independent researchers to double-check how the research was performed, and to follow up by performing similar experiments to determine how dependable the results might be.[108] Taken in its entirety, the scientific method allows for highly creative problem solving while minimizing any effects of subjective bias on the part of its users (especially the confirmation bias).[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nRole of mathematics\\r\\nMain articles: Mathematics and Formal science\\r\\n\\r\\nCalculus, the mathematics of continuous change, underpins many of the sciences.\\r\\nMathematics is essential in the formation of hypotheses, theories, and laws[110] in the natural and social sciences. For example, it is used in quantitative scientific modeling, which can generate new hypotheses and predictions to be tested. It is also used extensively in observing and collecting measurements. Statistics, a branch of mathematics, is used to summarize and analyze data, which allow scientists to assess the reliability and variability of their experimental results.\\r\\n\\r\\nComputational science applies computing power to simulate real-world situations, enabling a better understanding of scientific problems than formal mathematics alone can achieve. According to the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, computation is now as important as theory and experiment in advancing scientific knowledge.[111]\\r\\n\\r\\nVerifiability\\r\\nJohn Ziman points out that intersubjective verifiability is fundamental to the creation of all scientific knowledge.[112]:44 Ziman shows how scientists can identify patterns to each other across centuries; he refers to this ability as \\\"perceptual consensibility.\\\"[113]:46 He then makes consensibility, leading to consensus, the touchstone of reliable knowledge.[113]:104\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilosophy of science\\r\\nSee also: Philosophy of science\\r\\n\\r\\nEnglish philosopher and physician John Locke (1632\ufffd1704), a leading philosopher of British empiricism\\r\\nScientists usually take for granted a set of basic assumptions that are needed to justify the scientific method: (1) that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers; (2) that this objective reality is governed by natural laws; (3) that these laws can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation.[24] Philosophy of science seeks a deep understanding of what these underlying assumptions mean and whether they are valid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe belief that scientific theories should and do represent metaphysical reality is known as realism. It can be contrasted with anti-realism, the view that the success of science does not depend on it being accurate about unobservable entities such as electrons. One form of anti-realism is idealism, the belief that the mind or consciousness is the most basic essence, and that each mind generates its own reality.[j] In an idealistic world view, what is true for one mind need not be true for other minds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are different schools of thought in philosophy of science. The most popular position is empiricism,[k] which holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation and that scientific theories are the result of generalizations from such observations.[114] Empiricism generally encompasses inductivism, a position that tries to explain the way general theories can be justified by the finite number of observations humans can make and hence the finite amount of empirical evidence available to confirm scientific theories. This is necessary because the number of predictions those theories make is infinite, which means that they cannot be known from the finite amount of evidence using deductive logic only. Many versions of empiricism exist, with the predominant ones being Bayesianism[115] and the hypothetico-deductive method.[116]:236\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Austrian-British philosopher of science Karl Popper (1902\ufffd1994) in 1990. He is best known for his work on empirical falsification.\\r\\nEmpiricism has stood in contrast to rationalism, the position originally associated with Descartes, which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect, not by observation.[116]:20 Critical rationalism is a contrasting 20th-century approach to science, first defined by Austrian-British philosopher Karl Popper. Popper rejected the way that empiricism describes the connection between theory and observation. He claimed that theories are not generated by observation, but that observation is made in the light of theories and that the only way a theory can be affected by observation is when it comes in conflict with it.[116]:63\ufffd67 Popper proposed replacing verifiability with falsifiability as the landmark of scientific theories and replacing induction with falsification as the empirical method.[116]:68 Popper further claimed that there is actually only one universal method, not specific to science: the negative method of criticism, trial and error.[117] It covers all products of the human mind, including science, mathematics, philosophy, and art.[118]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother approach, instrumentalism, colloquially termed \\\"shut up and multiply,\\\"[119] emphasizes the utility of theories as instruments for explaining and predicting phenomena.[120] It views scientific theories as black boxes with only their input (initial conditions) and output (predictions) being relevant. Consequences, theoretical entities, and logical structure are claimed to be something that should simply be ignored and that scientists shouldn't make a fuss about (see interpretations of quantum mechanics). Close to instrumentalism is constructive empiricism, according to which the main criterion for the success of a scientific theory is whether what it says about observable entities is true.\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas Kuhn argued that the process of observation and evaluation takes place within a paradigm, a logically consistent \\\"portrait\\\" of the world that is consistent with observations made from its framing. He characterized normal science as the process of observation and \\\"puzzle solving\\\" which takes place within a paradigm, whereas revolutionary science occurs when one paradigm overtakes another in a paradigm shift.[121] Each paradigm has its own distinct questions, aims, and interpretations. The choice between paradigms involves setting two or more \\\"portraits\\\" against the world and deciding which likeness is most promising. A paradigm shift occurs when a significant number of observational anomalies arise in the old paradigm and a new paradigm makes sense of them. That is, the choice of a new paradigm is based on observations, even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm. For Kuhn, acceptance or rejection of a paradigm is a social process as much as a logical process. Kuhn's position, however, is not one of relativism.[122]\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, another approach often cited in debates of scientific skepticism against controversial movements like \\\"creation science\\\" is methodological naturalism. Its main point is that a difference between natural and supernatural explanations should be made and that science should be restricted methodologically to natural explanations.[l] That the restriction is merely methodological (rather than ontological) means that science should not consider supernatural explanations itself, but should not claim them to be wrong either. Instead, supernatural explanations should be left a matter of personal belief outside the scope of science. Methodological naturalism maintains that proper science requires strict adherence to empirical study and independent verification as a process for properly developing and evaluating explanations for observable phenomena.[123] The absence of these standards, arguments from authority, biased observational studies and other common fallacies are frequently cited by supporters of methodological naturalism as characteristic of the non-science they criticize.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainty and science\\r\\nA scientific theory is empirical[k][124] and is always open to falsification if new evidence is presented. That is, no theory is ever considered strictly certain as science accepts the concept of fallibilism.[m] The philosopher of science Karl Popper sharply distinguished truth from certainty. He wrote that scientific knowledge \\\"consists in the search for truth,\\\" but it \\\"is not the search for certainty ... All human knowledge is fallible and therefore uncertain.\\\"[125]:4\\r\\n\\r\\nNew scientific knowledge rarely results in vast changes in our understanding. According to psychologist Keith Stanovich, it may be the media's overuse of words like \\\"breakthrough\\\" that leads the public to imagine that science is constantly proving everything it thought was true to be false.[100]:119\ufffd38 While there are such famous cases as the theory of relativity that required a complete reconceptualization, these are extreme exceptions. Knowledge in science is gained by a gradual synthesis of information from different experiments by various researchers across different branches of science; it is more like a climb than a leap.[100]:123 Theories vary in the extent to which they have been tested and verified, as well as their acceptance in the scientific community.[n] For example, heliocentric theory, the theory of evolution, relativity theory, and germ theory still bear the name \\\"theory\\\" even though, in practice, they are considered factual.[126] Philosopher Barry Stroud adds that, although the best definition for \\\"knowledge\\\" is contested, being skeptical and entertaining the possibility that one is incorrect is compatible with being correct. Therefore, scientists adhering to proper scientific approaches will doubt themselves even once they possess the truth.[127] The fallibilist C. S. Peirce argued that inquiry is the struggle to resolve actual doubt and that merely quarrelsome, verbal, or hyperbolic doubt is fruitless[128] \ufffd but also that the inquirer should try to attain genuine doubt rather than resting uncritically on common sense.[129] He held that the successful sciences trust not to any single chain of inference (no stronger than its weakest link) but to the cable of multiple and various arguments intimately connected.[130]\\r\\n\\r\\nStanovich also asserts that science avoids searching for a \\\"magic bullet\\\"; it avoids the single-cause fallacy. This means a scientist would not ask merely \\\"What is the cause of ...\\\", but rather \\\"What are the most significant causes of ...\\\". This is especially the case in the more macroscopic fields of science (e.g. psychology, physical cosmology).[100]:141\ufffd47 Research often analyzes few factors at once, but these are always added to the long list of factors that are most important to consider.[100]:141\ufffd47 For example, knowing the details of only a person's genetics, or their history and upbringing, or the current situation may not explain a behavior, but a deep understanding of all these variables combined can be very predictive.\\r\\n\\r\\nFringe science, pseudoscience, and junk science\\r\\nAn area of study or speculation that masquerades as science in an attempt to claim a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is sometimes referred to as pseudoscience, fringe science, or junk science.[o] Physicist Richard Feynman coined the term \\\"cargo cult science\\\" for cases in which researchers believe they are doing science because their activities have the outward appearance of science but actually lack the \\\"kind of utter honesty\\\" that allows their results to be rigorously evaluated.[131] Various types of commercial advertising, ranging from hype to fraud, may fall into these categories.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere can also be an element of political or ideological bias on all sides of scientific debates. Sometimes, research may be characterized as \\\"bad science,\\\" research that may be well-intended but is actually incorrect, obsolete, incomplete, or over-simplified expositions of scientific ideas. The term \\\"scientific misconduct\\\" refers to situations such as where researchers have intentionally misrepresented their published data or have purposely given credit for a discovery to the wrong person.[132]\\r\\n\\r\\nScientific literature\\r\\nMain article: Scientific literature\\r\\n\\r\\nCover of the first volume of the scientific journal Science in 1880.\\r\\nScientific research is published in an enormous range of scientific literature.[133] Scientific journals communicate and document the results of research carried out in universities and various other research institutions, serving as an archival record of science. The first scientific journals, Journal des S\ufffdavans followed by the Philosophical Transactions, began publication in 1665. Since that time the total number of active periodicals has steadily increased. In 1981, one estimate for the number of scientific and technical journals in publication was 11,500.[134] The United States National Library of Medicine currently indexes 5,516 journals that contain articles on topics related to the life sciences. Although the journals are in 39 languages, 91 percent of the indexed articles are published in English.[135]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost scientific journals cover a single scientific field and publish the research within that field; the research is normally expressed in the form of a scientific paper. Science has become so pervasive in modern societies that it is generally considered necessary to communicate the achievements, news, and ambitions of scientists to a wider populace.\\r\\n\\r\\nScience magazines such as New Scientist, Science & Vie, and Scientific American cater to the needs of a much wider readership and provide a non-technical summary of popular areas of research, including notable discoveries and advances in certain fields of research. Science books engage the interest of many more people. Tangentially, the science fiction genre, primarily fantastic in nature, engages the public imagination and transmits the ideas, if not the methods, of science.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecent efforts to intensify or develop links between science and non-scientific disciplines such as literature or more specifically, poetry, include the Creative Writing Science resource developed through the Royal Literary Fund.[136]\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch\\tImpact\\r\\nStatic electricity and magnetism (c. 1600)\\r\\nElectric current (18th century)\\tAll electric appliances, dynamos, electric power stations, modern electronics, including electric lighting, television, electric heating, transcranial magnetic stimulation, deep brain stimulation, magnetic tape, loudspeaker, and the compass and lightning rod.\\r\\nDiffraction (1665)\\tOptics, hence fiber optic cable (1840s), modern intercontinental communications, and cable TV and internet\\r\\nGerm theory (1700)\\tHygiene, leading to decreased transmission of infectious diseases; antibodies, leading to techniques for disease diagnosis and targeted anticancer therapies.\\r\\nVaccination (1798)\\tLeading to the elimination of most infectious diseases from developed countries and the worldwide eradication of smallpox.\\r\\nPhotovoltaic effect (1839)\\tSolar cells (1883), hence solar power, solar powered watches, calculators and other devices.\\r\\nThe strange orbit of Mercury (1859) and other research\\r\\nleading to special (1905) and general relativity (1916)\\tSatellite-based technology such as GPS (1973), satnav and satellite communications[p]\\r\\nRadio waves (1887)\\tRadio had become used in innumerable ways beyond its better-known areas of telephony, and broadcast television (1927) and radio (1906) entertainment.

He also won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his work in theoretical physics.\\r\\nScientists are individuals who conduct scientific research to advance knowledge in an area of interest.[137][138] The term scientist was coined by William Whewell in 1833. In modern times, many professional scientists are trained in an academic setting and upon completion, attain an academic degree, with the highest degree being a doctorate such as a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD),[139] Doctor of Medicine (MD), or Doctor of Engineering (DEng). Many scientists pursue careers in various sectors of the economy such as academia, industry, government, and nonprofit environments.[140][141][142]\\r\\n\\r\\nScientists include experimentalists who mainly who perform experiments to test hypotheses and theoreticians who mainly develop new models to explain existing data and predict new results. Many have a desire to understand why the world is as we see it and how it came to be. They exhibit a strong curiosity about reality. Other motivations are recognition by their peers and prestige. The Nobel Prize, a widely regarded prestigious award,[143] is awarded annually to those who have achieved scientific advances in the fields of medicine, physics, chemistry, and economics. Some scientists have a desire to apply scientific knowledge for the benefit of people's health, nations, environment, or industries.\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen in science\\r\\nMain article: Women in science\\r\\nFurther information: Women in STEM fields\\r\\n\\r\\nMarie Curie was the first person to be awarded two Nobel Prizes: Physics in 1903 and Chemistry in 1911.[144]\\r\\nScience has historically been a male-dominated field, with some notable exceptions.[q] Women faced considerable discrimination in science, much as they did in other areas of male-dominated societies, such as frequently being passed over for job opportunities and denied credit for their work.[r] For example, Christine Ladd (1847\ufffd1930) was able to enter a PhD program as \\\"C. Ladd\\\"; Christine \\\"Kitty\\\" Ladd completed the requirements in 1882, but was awarded her degree only in 1926, after a career which spanned the algebra of logic (see truth table), color vision, and psychology. Her work preceded notable researchers like Ludwig Wittgenstein and Charles Sanders Peirce. The achievements of women in science have been attributed to their defiance of their traditional role as laborers within the domestic sphere.[145]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 20th century, active recruitment of women and elimination of institutional discrimination on the basis of sex greatly increased the number of women scientists, but large gender disparities remain in some fields; over half of new biologists are female, while 80% of PhDs in physics are given to men.[citation needed] Feminists claim this is the result of culture rather than an innate difference between the sexes, and some experiments have shown that parents challenge and explain more to boys than girls, asking them to reflect more deeply and logically.[146]: 258\ufffd61. In the early part of the 21st century, women in the United States earned 50.3% of bachelor's degrees, 45.6% of master's degrees, and 40.7% of PhDs in science and engineering fields. They earned more than half of the degrees in psychology (about 70%), social sciences (about 50%), and biology (about 50-60%) but earned less than half the degrees in the physical sciences, earth sciences, mathematics, engineering, and computer science.[147] Lifestyle choice also plays a major role in female engagement in science; women with young children are 28% less likely to take tenure-track positions due to work-life balance issues,[148] and female graduate students' interest in careers in research declines dramatically over the course of graduate school, whereas that of their male colleagues remains unchanged.[149]\\r\\n\\r\\nLearned societies\\r\\nFurther information: Learned society\\r\\n\\r\\nPhysicists in front of the Royal Society building in London (1952).\\r\\nLearned societies for the communication and promotion of scientific thought and experimentation have existed since the Renaissance.[150] Many scientists belong to a learned society that promotes their respective scientific discipline, profession, or group of related disciplines.[151] Membership may be open to all, may require possession of some qualifications, or may be an honor conferred by election.[152] Membership often requires possession of some scientific credentials, or may be an honor conferred by election. Most scientific societies are non-profit organizations, and many are professional associations. Their activities typically include holding regular conferences for the presentation and discussion of new research results and publishing or sponsoring academic journals in their discipline. Some also act as professional bodies, regulating the activities of their members in the public interest or the collective interest of the membership. Scholars in the sociology of science[who?] argue that learned societies are of key importance and their formation assists in the emergence and development of new disciplines or professions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe professionalization of science, begun in the 19th century, was partly enabled by the creation of distinguished academy of sciences in a number of countries such as the Italian Accademia dei Lincei in 1603,[153] the British Royal Society in 1660, the French Acad\ufffdmie des Sciences in 1666,[154] the American National Academy of Sciences in 1863, the German Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in 1911, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1928. International scientific organizations, such as the International Council for Science, have since been formed to promote cooperation between the scientific communities of different nations.\\r\\n\\r\\nScience and the public\\r\\n\\\"Science and society\\\" redirects here. For the academic journal, see Science & Society.\\r\\nScience policy\\r\\nMain articles: Science policy, History of science policy, and Economics of science\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United Nations Global Science-Policy-Business Forum on the Environment in Nairobi, Kenya (2017).\\r\\nScience policy is an area of public policy concerned with the policies that affect the conduct of the scientific enterprise, including research funding, often in pursuance of other national policy goals such as technological innovation to promote commercial product development, weapons development, health care and environmental monitoring. Science policy also refers to the act of applying scientific knowledge and consensus to the development of public policies. Science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve the natural sciences. In accordance with public policy being concerned about the well-being of its citizens, science policy's goal is to consider how science and technology can best serve the public.\\r\\n\\r\\nState policy has influenced the funding of public works and science for thousands of years, particularly within civilizations with highly organized governments such as imperial China and the Roman Empire. Prominent historical examples include the Great Wall of China, completed over the course of two millennia through the state support of several dynasties, and the Grand Canal of the Yangtze River, an immense feat of hydraulic engineering begun by Sunshu Ao (??? 7th c. BCE), Ximen Bao (??? 5th c.BCE), and Shi Chi (4th c. BCE). This construction dates from the 6th century BCE under the Sui Dynasty and is still in use today. In China, such state-supported infrastructure and scientific research projects date at least from the time of the Mohists, who inspired the study of logic during the period of the Hundred Schools of Thought and the study of defensive fortifications like the Great Wall of China during the Warring States period.\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic policy can directly affect the funding of capital equipment and intellectual infrastructure for industrial research by providing tax incentives to those organizations that fund research. Vannevar Bush, director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development for the United States government, the forerunner of the National Science Foundation, wrote in July 1945 that \\\"Science is a proper concern of government.\\\"[155]\\r\\n\\r\\nFunding of science\\r\\nMain article: Funding of science\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Main Entomology Building in Australia\\r\\nScientific research is often funded through a competitive process in which potential research projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive funding. Such processes, which are run by government, corporations, or foundations, allocate scarce funds. Total research funding in most developed countries is between 1.5% and 3% of GDP.[156] In the OECD, around two-thirds of research and development in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry, and 20% and 10% respectively by universities and government. The government funding proportion in certain industries is higher, and it dominates research in social science and humanities. Similarly, with some exceptions (e.g. biotechnology) government provides the bulk of the funds for basic scientific research. Many governments have dedicated agencies to support scientific research. Prominent scientific organizations include the National Science Foundation in the United States, the National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Argentina, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia, Centre national de la recherche scientifique in France, the Max Planck Society and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft in Germany, and CSIC in Spain. In commercial research and development, all but the most research-oriented corporations focus more heavily on near-term commercialisation possibilities rather than \\\"blue-sky\\\" ideas or technologies (such as nuclear fusion).\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic awareness of science\\r\\nMain article: Public awareness of science\\r\\nFurther information: Science outreach and Science communication\\r\\n\\r\\nDinosaur exhibit in the Houston Museum of Natural Science\\r\\nThe public awareness of science relates to the attitudes, behaviors, opinions, and activities that make up the relations between science and the general public. it integrates various themes and activities such as science communication, science museums, science festivals, science fairs, citizen science, and science in popular culture. Social scientists have devised various metrics to measure the public understanding of science such as factual knowledge, self-reported knowledge, and structural knowledge.[157][158]\\r\\n\\r\\nScience journalism\\r\\nMain article: Science journalism\\r\\nThe mass media face a number of pressures that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims in terms of their credibility within the scientific community as a whole. Determining how much weight to give different sides in a scientific debate may require considerable expertise regarding the matter.[159] Few journalists have real scientific knowledge, and even beat reporters who know a great deal about certain scientific issues may be ignorant about other scientific issues that they are suddenly asked to cover.[160][161]\\r\\n\\r\\nPoliticization of science\\r\\nMain article: Politicization of science\\r\\n\\r\\nResults of seven papers from 2004\ufffd2015 assessing the overwhelming scientific consensus on man-made global warming (see Surveys of scientists' views on climate change), in contrast to the political controversy over this issue, particularly in the United States.\\r\\nPoliticization of science occurs when government, business, or advocacy groups use legal or economic pressure to influence the findings of scientific research or the way it is disseminated, reported, or interpreted. Many factors can act as facets of the politicization of science such as populist anti-intellectualism, perceived threats to religious beliefs, postmodernist subjectivism, and fear for business interests.[162] Politicization of science is usually accomplished when scientific information is presented in a way that emphasizes the uncertainty associated with the scientific evidence.[163] Tactics such as shifting conversation, failing to acknowledge facts, and capitalizing on doubt of scientific consensus have been used to gain more attention for views that have been undermined by scientific evidence.[164] Examples of issues that have involved the politicization of science include the global warming controversy, health effects of pesticides, and health effects of tobacco.[164][165]\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"evals\":[],\"id\":-2067386457},{\"title\":\"technology\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools.

Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's environment. Innovations have always influenced the values of a society and raised new questions of the ethics of technology. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of the term \\\"technology\\\" has changed significantly over the last 200 years. Before the 20th century, the term was uncommon in English, and it was used either to refer to the description or study of the useful arts[3] or to allude to technical education, as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (chartered in 1861).[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\\"technology\\\" rose to prominence in the 20th century in connection with the Second Industrial Revolution. The term's meanings changed in the early 20th century when American social scientists, beginning with Thorstein Veblen, translated ideas from the German concept of Technik into \\\"technology.\\\" In German and other European languages, a distinction exists between technik and technologie that is absent in English, which usually translates both terms as \\\"technology.\\\" By the 1930s, \\\"technology\\\" referred not only to the study of the industrial arts but to the industrial arts themselves.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1937, the American sociologist Read Bain wrote that \\\"technology includes all tools, machines, utensils, weapons, instruments, housing, clothing, communicating and transporting devices and the skills by which we produce and use them.\\\"[6] Bain's definition remains common among scholars today, especially social scientists. Scientists and engineers usually prefer to define technology as applied science, rather than as the things that people make and use.[7] More recently, scholars have borrowed from European philosophers of \\\"technique\\\" to extend the meaning of technology to various forms of instrumental reason, as in Foucault's work on technologies of the self (techniques de soi).\\r\\n\\r\\nDictionaries and scholars have offered a variety of definitions. The Merriam-Webster Learner's Dictionary offers a definition of the term: \\\"the use of science in industry, engineering, etc., to invent useful things or to solve problems\\\" and \\\"a machine, piece of equipment, method, etc., that is created by technology.\\\"[8] Ursula Franklin, in her 1989 \\\"Real World of Technology\\\" lecture, gave another definition of the concept; it is \\\"practice, the way we do things around here.\\\"[9] The term is often used to imply a specific field of technology, or to refer to high technology or just consumer electronics, rather than technology as a whole.[10] Bernard Stiegler, in Technics and Time, 1, defines technology in two ways: as \\\"the pursuit of life by means other than life,\\\" and as \\\"organized inorganic matter.\\\"[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnology can be most broadly defined as the entities, both material and immaterial, created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value. In this usage, technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve real-world problems. It is a far-reaching term that may include simple tools, such as a crowbar or wooden spoon, or more complex machines, such as a space station or particle accelerator. Tools and machines need not be material; virtual technology, such as computer software and business methods, fall under this definition of technology.[12] W. Brian Arthur defines technology in a similarly broad way as \\\"a means to fulfill a human purpose.\\\"[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word \\\"technology\\\" can also be used to refer to a collection of techniques. In this context, it is the current state of humanity's knowledge of how to combine resources to produce desired products, to solve problems, fulfill needs, or satisfy wants; it includes technical methods, skills, processes, techniques, tools and raw materials. When combined with another term, such as \\\"medical technology\\\" or \\\"space technology,\\\" it refers to the state of the respective field's knowledge and tools. \\\"State-of-the-art technology\\\" refers to the high technology available to humanity in any field.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe invention of integrated circuits and the microprocessor (here, an Intel 4004 chip from 1971) led to the modern computer revolution.\\r\\nTechnology can be viewed as an activity that forms or changes culture.[14] Additionally, technology is the application of math, science, and the arts for the benefit of life as it is known. A modern example is the rise of communication technology, which has lessened barriers to human interaction and as a result has helped spawn new subcultures; the rise of cyberculture has at its basis the development of the Internet and the computer.[15] Not all technology enhances culture in a creative way; technology can also help facilitate political oppression and war via tools such as guns. As a cultural activity, technology predates both science and engineering, each of which formalize some aspects of technological endeavor.\\r\\n\\r\\naspects of technological endeavor.\\r\\n\\r\\nScience, engineering and technology\\r\\n\\r\\nAntoine Lavoisier conducting an experiment with combustion generated by amplified sun light\\r\\nThe distinction between science, engineering, and technology is not always clear. Science is systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation.[16] Technologies are not usually exclusively products of science, because they have to satisfy requirements such as utility, usability, and safety.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nEngineering is the goal-oriented process of designing and making tools and systems to exploit natural phenomena for practical human means, often (but not always) using results and techniques from science. The development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge, including scientific, engineering, mathematical, linguistic, and historical knowledge, to achieve some practical result.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnology is often a consequence of science and engineering, although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields. For example, science might study the flow of electrons in electrical conductors by using already-existing tools and knowledge. This new-found knowledge may then be used by engineers to create new tools and machines such as semiconductors, computers, and other forms of advanced technology. In this sense, scientists and engineers may both be considered technologists; the three fields are often considered as one for the purposes of research and reference.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exact relations between science and technology in particular have been debated by scientists, historians, and policymakers in the late 20th century, in part because the debate can inform the funding of basic and applied science. In the immediate wake of World War II, for example, it was widely considered in the United States that technology was simply \\\"applied science\\\" and that to fund basic science was to reap technological results in due time. An articulation of this philosophy could be found explicitly in Vannevar Bush's treatise on postwar science policy, Science \ufffd The Endless Frontier: \\\"New products, new industries, and more jobs require continuous additions to knowledge of the laws of nature ... This essential new knowledge can be obtained only through basic scientific research.\\\"[18] In the late-1960s, however, this view came under direct attack, leading towards initiatives to fund science for specific tasks (initiatives resisted by the scientific community). The issue remains contentious, though most analysts resist the model that technology simply is a result of scientific research.[19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"evals\":[],\"id\":-876433920},{\"title\":\"world\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"Although in most of the English-speaking world this field is not usually regarded as a specific specialization for journalists, it is so in nearly all the world.

(Amsterdam). Since these papers were aimed at bankers and merchants, they brought mostly news from other markets, which usually meant other nations. In any case, it is worthy to remark that nation-states were still incipient in 17th-century Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the 19th century on, with newspapers already established in Europe, the United States and a few other countries, innovations in telecommunications such as the telegraph made news from abroad easier to be spread. The first news agencies were then founded, like AFP (France), Reuters (UK), Wolff (currently DPA, Germany) and the AP (US).\\r\\n\\r\\nWar journalism is one of the best known subfields of world news (although war coverage can be national for the media of belligerent countries themselves).\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are essentially two types of reporters who do foreign reporting: the foreign correspondent (full-time reporter employed by a news source) and the special envoy (sent abroad to cover a specific subject, temporarily stationed in a location).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe correspondent is a reporter based in a foreign city (often the capital of a country) covering a region, a country or sometimes even an entire continent. He or she regularly files stories to the news editor. He\/she gathers materials for these stories from local officials, members of the community, and the local media, as well as from events he\/she directly witnesses. Correspondents typically stay in touch with the local community and maintain contacts with other journalists and correspondents in order to identify strategic sources in the government, among diplomats, members of the military and other organizations on the ground who may provide important information.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of foreign correspondents has dropped significantly over the past 20 years or more. Often, a media company is either uninterested or unable to afford to support a single correspondent, such as in many developing countries. In some places, they cannot obtain visas due to political constraints, or otherwise dangerous conditions prohibit a media company from stationing a reporter there. In recent years, the drop in foreign correspondents has been due to cutbacks within media companies (often, but not always, a result of economics alone).[1] Among English language newspapers, only eight daily newspapers have full-time correspondents in more than ten foreign stations, four from the US, three from the UK and one from India:\\r\\n\\r\\n35 \ufffd Wall Street Journal (US): Baghdad, Bangkok, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Brussels, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Istanbul, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, Kuala Lumpur, Lagos, London, Manila, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, Paris, Prague, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, S\ufffdo Paulo, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Taipei, Tokyo, Toronto, Zurich\\r\\n\\r\\n24 \ufffd New York Times (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Cairo, Caracas, Dakar, Hong Kong, Islamabad, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Rome, S\ufffdo Paulo, Shanghai, Tokyo\\r\\n\\r\\n19 \ufffd Financial Times (UK): Beijing, Berlin, Bombay, Brussels, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, New York, Paris, Taipei, Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney, Washington\\r\\n\\r\\n17 \ufffd Washington Post (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Berlin, Bogot\ufffd, Cairo, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Shanghai, Tehran, Tokyo\\r\\n\\r\\n15 \ufffd The Guardian (UK): Accra, Bangkok, Beijing, Berlin, Brussels, Kabul, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Los Angeles, Madrid, New York, Paris, Rome, Tehran, Tokyo\\r\\n\\r\\n13 \ufffd The Daily Telegraph (UK): Beijing, Brussels, Jerusalem, Kabul, Los Angeles, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, New York, Paris, Shanghai, Sydney, Washington\\r\\n\\r\\n13 \ufffd Los Angeles Times (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Cairo, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, New Delhi, Seoul\\r\\n\\r\\n12 \ufffd The Hindu (India): Addis Ababa, Beijing, Colombo, Dhaka, Dubai, Islamabad, Kathmandu, London, Moscow, Paris, Singapore, Washington\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen reporters working abroad have no permanent labor contract with media outlets, they are called stringers.

By the end of that year, 82,362 cases of AIDS had been reported in the United States, and more than 61,000 people had died nationwide. In the 30 years since, the disease has killed an estimated 35.4 million people in all, including more than 700,000 in the United States. Today, there are still some 36.9 million people living with H.I.V. and AIDS around the world.\\r\\nJames Estrin, the editor of The New York Times\u2019s Lens blog and a senior staff photographer, was a young freelancer when he began covering the AIDS crisis for the paper. \u201cBeing a photographer, what you hold on to is the hope that your image had an effect or changed things,\u201d he said recently. \u201cThat\u2019s what you want, but you can\u2019t measure that effect. What you can know is that if your images were published in The New York Times, people won\u2019t be able to say they didn\u2019t know. That\u2019s good and that\u2019s enough.\u201d \\r\\nWe asked three Times photographers and one reporter who covered the AIDS crisis as the epidemic escalated to reflect on how they navigated what was then an unknown and terrifying world.\\r\\n\u201cThe humiliation that was connected to the disease was so horrible to me. My cousin\u2019s boyfriend died, and it was impossible to find anyone that would take his body and bury him. There was only one place in all of New York City that would actually take a person and bury them. It was Redden\u2019s on 14th Street. It\u2019s still there. Many years later, his nephew came to New York, and we went there, and we thanked them.\\r\\nThe people with AIDS had very little time left and most were filled with fear. Fear of the disease. Fear of coming out. When someone would actually let me take their picture, it was an act of enormous generosity, and I always felt very grateful. I hope they could feel that, because being a photographer is so secondary to being the kind of person that subjects can trust.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cEarly on, we were all learning how to cover AIDS, and the photographers were unbelievably disadvantaged. I could piece together a story of a certain child by doing 15 interviews: doctors, nurses, social workers. But the photographer could never piece together a picture. Either you got the image or you didn\u2019t. If you look back, you can see the number of stories that were illustrated with pictures of health care professionals or objects like the H.I.V. testing forms.\u201d \\r\\n\u201cI was one of the few photographers on the staff that was using strobes and off-camera lighting. You know, portrait studio-type lighting, on location. So for me, the important thing was, no matter how tragic this was, the fact that this person was willing to talk to us and share her story, and allow herself to be photographed, I wanted to make sure it was a beautiful photograph. Why would I try to make this tragedy look even more tragic? Again, it was the whole notion of treating people that were going through this with a great deal of respect. And to do that photographically, as well as in person.\u201d \\r\\n\u201cWhile it was the same disease, the experience of reporting it \u2014 and I assume photographing it \u2014 was completely different when it was gay men and when it became essentially people who\u2019d gotten it from a needle. The gay men knew exactly what was going on, and they could talk articulately about the experience they were having. They knew all about the drugs, they became their own best advocates, and for a very long time, gay men were the only people who really knew anything. If you go back and read the stories that are about them, they are the ones telling you the story. The stories that are about drug addicts or children, somebody else is always telling you the story.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cThe Act Up protests were extraordinary. Which isn\u2019t surprising. So many people involved in Act Up were involved in theater or the arts. The types of protests they did were completely different. It had dramatic structure. It was fascinating to photograph. They were, by far, the best protests. They\u2019d have these \u2018die-ins.\u2019 They were really smart and well put together.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cShooting in Africa was very different. It was much harder. There was enormous stigma connected with the disease, and it felt bad to just take pictures of someone who was dying and go away. It felt so cold. Luckily, I had a Polaroid camera with me, and that turned out to be a wonderful icebreaker. Being able to give a person who might have never seen a picture of themselves a photo they could keep made me happy and often made my job a little easier.\\\"\\r\\n\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1866762071,\"description\":\"Covering the tragic escalation of an epidemic\\r\",\"title\":\"Past Tense: Loss and Bravery: Intimate Snapshots From the First Decade of the AIDS Crisis\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"health.9.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"BUENOS AIRES \u2014 President Trump and his Mexican and Canadian counterparts sought to put the acrimony of the past two years behind them on Friday as they signed a new trade agreement governing hundreds of billions of dollars in commerce that underpins their mutually dependent economies.\\r\\nMeeting for the first time since the revised North American Free Trade Agreement was sealed, Mr. Trump, President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada hailed the results as a boon for workers, businesses and the environment, even as they alluded to the harsh talks that had preceded this day.\\r\\nBut Mr. Trump faces a daunting challenge at home, where Congress must approve the deal before it can take effect.\\r\\nThe complicated politics of trade would have made the task formidable enough even before the midterm elections, but it will grow only more so once Democrats assume control of the House in January.\\r\\nIn signing the agreement on Friday, Mr. Trump sought to ratchet up the pressure on President Xi Jinping of China, with whom he will meet on Saturday amid an escalating trade war.\\r\\nMr. Trump has already imposed tariffs of 10 percent on many Chinese goods and has threatened to raise them to 25 percent. He signaled as late as Friday that he may reach an understanding with Mr. Xi during a dinner to forestall such a move.\\r\\nThe agreement with Canada and Mexico is a signature achievement for Mr. Trump, who has long derided nearly every major trade deal that the United States has entered.\\r\\nSome pro-trade lawmakers complain that the revised agreement puts too many limits on the free flow of goods and services across borders, while trade skeptics maintain that it does not do enough to safeguard American jobs, encourage higher wages and protect the environment.\\r\\nSubmission to Congress will open a frenzy of fresh negotiations over legislation to enact the agreement, potentially unraveling the careful balance achieved with Mexico and Canada.\\r\\nNegotiators reached a last-minute deal in September after months of rancorous talks that raised doubts about whether any accord was possible. Mr. Trump repeatedly assailed his counterparts and threatened to scrap Nafta altogether.\\r\\nThe appearance of the three leaders side by side in Buenos Aires to attend an economic summit meeting of the Group of 20, or G-20, was meant to paper over the bitterness, but the hard feelings were still evident.\\r\\n\u201cWe worked hard on this agreement,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s been long and hard. We\u2019ve taken a lot of barbs and a little abuse, and we got there. It\u2019s great for all of our countries.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Trump did not say that he was the one who had dished out most of the barbs and much of the abuse, but he insisted that he had come out of the process with a stronger relationship with the two leaders.\\r\\nHe said that Mr. Trudeau, whom he once assailed as \u201cvery dishonest and weak,\u201d had become \u201ca great friend,\u201d despite it all.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a battle,\u201d he added, \u201cand battles sometimes make great friendships.\u201d\\r\\nStoic and unmoved, Mr. Trudeau did not respond directly but seemed to refer implicitly to speculation that he might not attend the ceremony and send a lower-level official to sign in his place.\\r\\nHis schedule for Buenos Aires did not initially list the ceremony. He opted to attend anyway, saying the deal \u201cmaintains stability for Canada\u2019s entire economy\u201d and removes the dangers associated with a threatened United States withdrawal.\\r\\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here today,\u201d he said. \u201cThe new agreement lifts the risk of serious economic uncertainty that lingers throughout a trade renegotiation process.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Trudeau pointedly referred to the accord as the \u201cnew North American Free Trade Agreement\u201d and described it as \u201cmodernizing Nafta,\u201d despite Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to rebrand it as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\\r\\nThe Canadian leader also used the occasion to press Mr. Trump on steel and aluminum tariffs, which remain unresolved.\\r\\n\u201cMake no mistake, we will stand up for our workers and fight for their families and their communities,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said. \u201cAnd Donald, it\u2019s all the more reason why we need to keep working to remove the tariffs on steel and aluminum between our two countries.\u201d\\r\\nThe signing came shortly after a separate ceremony, hosted by Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, presenting Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, with Mexico\u2019s highest award for foreigners in honor of his role in negotiating the trade agreement.\\r\\nThe announcement this week that the award would go to Mr. Kushner drew waves of criticism, given the insulting language Mr. Trump has used about Mexicans, including his description during the presidential campaign of illegal immigrants from Mexico as rapists.\\r\\nIn accepting the Order of the Aztec Eagle from Mexico, Mr. Kushner insisted that the president\u2019s harsh language did not reflect the trust that has developed between the leaders of the two countries.\\r\\n\u201cThrough your direction and leadership we were able to accomplish a lot of great things,\u201d Mr. Kushner told Mr. Trump at the ceremony. \u201cWhile there has been a lot of tough talk, I have seen the genuine respect and care that President Trump has for Mexico and the Mexican people, and I do believe we have been able to put that in the right light.\u201d\\r\\nWhile analysts said the new trade agreement was not as much of a transformation as Mr. Trump has suggested, it does rewrite the rules for an extraordinary amount of commerce between the three nations.\\r\\nThe United States did $581.6 billion in business with Canada last year, and $557.6 billion with Mexico, making them the nation\u2019s second- and third-largest trading partners.\\r\\nUnder the agreement, American dairy farmers would be allowed greater access to Canada\u2019s market to sell their cheese, milk and other products. A higher percentage of cars would have to be manufactured in North America and factories must pay their workers an average of $16 an hour or more to be exempted from tariffs.\\r\\nThe deal also updates provisions on the digital economy, agriculture and labor unions, but it preserves an international dispute mechanism that Mr. Trump had sought to eliminate.\\r\\nWhether Mr. Trump can reach across the aisle to sell it to Congress remains an open question. In nearly two years in office, he has made little effort to forge bipartisan consensus in Congress, as Republicans controlled both chambers.\\r\\nBut trade muddies the usual partisan lines, with free traders and skeptics of globalization in both parties, and the dynamics were further complicated by the announcement this week by General Motors that it will eliminate 14,000 jobs and idle five plants in the United States and Canada.\\r\\nMr. Trump played down the challenge on Friday, expressing confidence that he would easily win approval by Congress.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s been so well reviewed, I don\u2019t expect to have very much of a problem,\u201d he said.\\r\\nBusiness groups and some Republicans praised the agreement and called for expeditious endorsement by lawmakers. \u201cI believe it will create more jobs and expand economic opportunities for American workers, farmers and manufacturers by leveling the playing field on trade,\u201d said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio.\\r\\nBut Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader and a longtime critic of Nafta, said on Friday that the new agreement could not be \u201csimply a rebranding of the same old policies that hurt our economy and workers for years\u201d if it is to pass Congress.\\r\\n\u201cIt must prove to be a net benefit to middle-class families and working people in our country and must have strong labor and environmental protections, which in the present deal are too weak,\u201d he said.\\r\\nA dozen Republican senators sent Mr. Trump a letter last week urging him to submit the agreement for approval in the lame-duck session of the departing Congress before Democrats assume control of the House in January.\\r\\nSenator Patrick J. Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania who signed the letter, said the deal still needed to be improved even now, despite what he considered the improvements to the trade structure between the three nations.\\r\\n\u201cUnfortunately, the benefits of these enhancements are more than offset by the trade-limiting provisions,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cHowever, I would be willing to vote for the agreement if the president takes steps to strengthen it in the coming weeks through pro-trade modifications in the implementing legislation.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-234078885,\"description\":\"President Trump appeared with his counterparts Justin Trudeau and Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto to approve the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement.\\r\",\"title\":\"Trump Signs New Trade Deal With Canada and Mexico After Bitter Negotiations\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"world.6.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Want climate news in your inbox?

The blackouts and other energy disruptions of Hurricane Harvey were just harbingers, the report said. Across the United States, every element of the country\u2019s energy infrastructure, like oil wells and nuclear power plants, will be stressed by droughts, heat waves, rising seas and fiercer storms.\\r\\n\u201cClimate change disrupts everything, including Trump\u2019s agenda,\u201d said Alice Hill, a research fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution think tank who served as senior director for resilience policy on the National Security Council under President Barack Obama.\\r\\nWhen it comes to fossil fuel production, the disruptions are particularly serious. And there\u2019s a fundamental irony at play. Even as emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are warming the planet, the consequences of that warming will make it harder to drill for oil, mine for coal and deliver fuel through pipelines.\\r\\nMr. Trump wants to boost oil and gas drilling on public lands in the West, but drought is expected to affect the water necessary for hydraulic fracturing, the technique of injecting vast amounts of liquid into the bedrock to force out natural gas or oil. In the Arctic, where Mr. Trump has plans to open sensitive areas to oil drilling, equipment built to withstand Alaska\u2019s freezing temperatures is particularly vulnerable to permafrost melting as the state warms at twice the rate of the rest of the country. \\r\\nCoal-burning power plants are at risk as well. Rising temperatures from extreme heat events, the report notes, are expected to reduce their capacity to generate power and hamper the efficiency of the transmission grid.\\r\\nThe national climate report, mandated by Congress and made public by the White House, makes the case that global warming \u201cis transforming where and how we live and presents growing challenges to human health.\u201d Soon after publication, however, President Trump and several members of his cabinet disavowed it. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the findings. \\r\\nPresident Trump\u2019s call for energy dominance has been a central ambition of his administration. He hit on the slogan in the early days of his presidency, predicting a \u201cgolden era of American energy\u201d that would be asserted via the country\u2019s booming natural gas, coal and petroleum exports.\\r\\nCabinet officials have taken up the mantra. \\r\\nInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke in announcing last year a lease sale of nearly 80 million acres of federal waters off the Gulf of Mexico, described it as \u201ca pillar of President Trump\u2019s plan to make the United States energy dominant.\u201d Energy Secretary Rick Perry has described energy dominance as \u201cexporting freedom,\u201d particularly by delivering America\u2019s liquefied natural gas and developing offshore oil drilling. \\r\\nEven at the Environmental Protection Agency, where the core mission is to ensure clean air and water, Andrew Wheeler, the acting administrator, has heralded ways he and his staff have advanced the president\u2019s energy dominance agenda by saving polluting industries billions of dollars in regulatory costs.\\r\\nThe findings from the National Climate Assessment, issued by 13 federal agencies, come as the new House Democratic majority prepares to conduct oversight next year into Mr. Trump\u2019s rollbacks of federal climate change policies. Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, who is expected to chair the House Science Committee, is part of a group of lawmakers planning two days of hearings in January into ways to both reduce planet-warming emissions and prepare for the consequences of rising temperatures.\\r\\n\u201cOur rapidly changing climate, and the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to take us in the wrong direction, seriously jeopardize our future,\u201d Ms. Johnson said.\\r\\nEnergy infrastructure is an expensive part of the problem, according to the assessment. The report does not provide firm estimates of expected costs. It does cite the fact that Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which resulted in gasoline lines stretching for miles, inoperable refineries and electricity outages affecting 8.7 million people, prodded utility companies in New York and New Jersey to invest billions of dollars in upgrades like elevating equipment and redesigning electrical networks to withstand extreme weather.\\r\\nThe report notes that Con Edison and Public Service Electric and Gas have invested about $2 billion in repairs in response to recent hurricanes. It also points out that the costs to reconstruct Puerto Rico\u2019s electricity systems in the wake of Hurricanes Irma and Maria are estimated around $17 billion. \\r\\nAnd while the report notes that energy companies and utilities are increasingly taking steps to harden their infrastructure \u2014 like planning for sea-level rise when building infrastructure \u2014 experts said the federal government needs to do more.\\r\\n\u201cWhen you lose access to energy, your entire economy grinds to a halt,\u201d said Jason Bordoff, director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University and a former White House energy adviser to President Obama during Hurricane Sandy. \\r\\n\u201cThe report lays out clearly the extent to which so many aspects of the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure are at risk from climate change,\u201d Mr. Bordoff said.\\r\\nEnergy systems in the Southeast are particularly vulnerable, the report said, with some 200 power plants and oil refineries exposed to flooding from hurricanes and fiercer storm surges. Scientists estimate, if sea levels rise nationally 3.3 feet (a figure it describes as on the \u201chigh end of the very likely range\u201d for what the country could see by 2100), it could expose dozens of power plants currently considered to be in safe zones to risks of 100-year floods. That would jeopardize about 25 gigawatts of operating power capacity, or power for about 18 million homes.\\r\\nAlong the Gulf Coast \u2014 home to a significant proportion of the United States oil production and refining industry \u2014 energy infrastructure faces a similar and more immediate risk. A sea level rise of less than 1.6 feet could double the number of refineries in Texas and Louisiana vulnerable to flooding by the end of the century.\\r\\nYet energy analysts cautioned against expectations that the effects of climate change will cause irreparable harm to the fossil fuel industry or make oil, gas and coal production fundamentally unattractive to investors. Sarah Ladislaw, an energy analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noted that the oil and gas sector has a long history of managing risks, including figuring out how to operate in politically unstable countries and prodding governments to loosen regulations they find too burdensome.\\r\\nClimate change will add \u201cheadwinds\u201d to fossil fuel companies, make production more costly in some areas and less competitive in others, Ms. Ladislaw said. But, she added, \u201cIf you\u2019re waiting for climate impacts to be the end of the oil and gas industry, that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d\\r\\nFor more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1578760496,\"description\":\"Rising temperatures undermine the president\u2019s vision of an energy-dominant America, affecting coal-fired power plants, oil production and the electrical grid, a federal report says.\\r\",\"title\":\"Trump\u2019s \u2018Energy Dominance\u2019 Doctrine Is Undermined by Climate Change\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.14.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Katie Rogers, a White House reporter for The Times, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.\\r\\nHow do President Trump and Melania Trump use tech?\\r\\nThey\u2019re an Apple couple. Both use their iPhones to interact with the outside world \u2014 sometimes to the chagrin of Mr. Trump\u2019s security advisers and critics.\\r\\nThe president is not as technologically savvy as the first lady. His aides slip him paper copies of news articles, and when he travels on Air Force One, an aide is often spotted carrying around these mysterious-looking cardboard boxes. They are full of paper documents. The president will often sift through the papers when he needs to refer to something \u2014 which can be where that famous Sharpie of his comes into play.\\r\\nMrs. Trump is more tech oriented. She uses Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, mainly on her phone. Like her husband, she is very interested in her coverage but also uses those tools to keep track of things she\u2019s interested in, including fashion design, magazines and astrology. (She\u2019s a Taurus and follows the @taurusismagic account on Twitter, which has an interesting bio.)\\r\\nShe keeps in touch with staff in person, but also through lots of email and texts. When planning events, she will do internet searches to find things she likes and then gives staff photos of what she wants, or draws things, with the Be Best logo being one example. She also uses email, text, phone calls and Signal to keep in touch with her contacts. \\r\\n(What a coincidence: I use Signal, too. Mrs. Trump, call me.)\\r\\nHow have you seen White House tech evolve under President Trump?\\r\\nI think moment-to-moment digital coverage of every single thing the president does is new with this White House. President Barack Obama had people tracking his movements through Twitter and beyond, but with this administration, journalists live-tweet, photograph and send video from pool sprays (brief Oval Office events) and Marine One departures, in addition to news conferences. \\r\\nIf I\u2019m on the road, it\u2019s easy for me to tune into a pool spray or speech through someone else\u2019s Periscope live-streaming account, for instance. And when the president is at one of his properties, including the Trump Hotel or Mar-a-Lago, I often lurk on Instagram to see who is hanging out with him.\\r\\nThe Trump White House also had journalists switch over to an in-house Wi-Fi network, which made some reporters understandably uncomfortable for security reasons. The West Wing has also made more use out of devices that scan for gadgets including phones \u2014 I can understand why Signal is so popular. I think the anxiety over surveillance is perhaps more heightened than it was under the Obama administration, which, by the way, did its part to pave the way for these types of procedures.\\r\\nWhat are your most important tech tools for keeping up with breaking news from the White House and talking to your sources?\\r\\nI\u2019ve been on this beat since January. I thought I was pretty much tethered to the news before, but this job requires you to imbibe a daily tidal wave of news. So that\u2019s fun.\\r\\nA lot of my monitoring is Twitter-based, so I use tools I\u2019ve relied on for years. I use Nuzzel, a social news app that lets me know what the people I follow on social media are sharing, which is helpful for identifying the stories getting traction. And I use Twitter\u2019s list function to sort all of the noise into manageable buckets: I have lists of White House reporters, politicians, White House aides and Washington chatterboxes.\\r\\nOutside of a few news apps, I dislike having notifications on my phone in general \u2014 my eyes tend to glaze over if I have too many \u2014 but I receive them from a few news organizations and whenever the president or his press secretary tweets. Several of my colleagues have the Apple Watch, which gives them a friendly little jolt when those tweets happen. I haven\u2019t been able to bring myself to cross that particular Pavlovian bridge yet.\\r\\nLiving and working in Washington have a way of narrowing your perception, so I try to make sure I understand what people outside my bubble are talking about and reading. On my computer, I use Tweetdeck \u2014 which helps manage Twitter accounts \u2014 to display a list of prominent conservatives, which runs alongside a list of journalists. It\u2019s interesting and instructive to see how the two worlds function in real time, especially when news hits.\\r\\nThis beat is competitive, and building it from scratch has meant using a lot of research tools \u2014 Nexis for phone numbers, Spokeo for social media accounts \u2014 and making a lot of cold calls and sending emails. (If I really need something, I\u2019ll go to your doorstep.) I\u2019ve also learned that calling from a blocked number leads people in the president\u2019s orbit to believe the call is coming from the White House, so they answer right away.\\r\\nI text or WhatsApp with my sources, and we often transition to Signal. With the caveat that nothing is perfectly secure, Signal encryption tends to provide peace of mind, especially since it comes with a function that allows messages to wipe out after a certain period. I have some sources who set their messages to dissolve after a few minutes, which has come in handy if they\u2019re sending documents.\\r\\nSpeaking of security, I use two-factor authentication on everything, and LastPass to save my passwords, because I\u2019m constantly forgetting what mine are.\\r\\nWhat could be better about some of these tools?\\r\\nThis is just a small thing, but you know how Snapchat will show you if someone screen-grabs your message? That would be interesting to have in Signal, but absolutely no one would use Signal if that function existed.\\r\\nAlso, Twitter can be a minefield of bad intentions and lost context. There is a performative aspect to being on that platform that I don\u2019t enjoy. So since 2016, I have used a service called TweetDelete, which gets rid of my tweets that are more than a week old. I was sort of wistful when I saw my entire Twitter history wiped out and delivered to me in a spreadsheet, but I have no regrets.\\r\\nOutside of work, what tech product do you and your family love? \\r\\nI wouldn\u2019t say my husband and I are particularly tech savvy. We still enjoy having good old-fashioned squabbles over the thermostat, so we don\u2019t have a smart home.\\r\\nAt home, I love having friends and loved ones over, so I use the NYT Cooking app to help find recipes to feed them. (I spent the fall perfecting an apple butter rugelach.) I love apps for travel, including Kayak, Hotel Tonight and Airbnb. And on my last vacation, which took me pretty far north, I downloaded Aurora Pro and Sky Guide to view the Perseid meteor shower.\\r\\nGiven the gig, I can have a hard time focusing or winding down, so I have been experimenting with meditation apps. I recently downloaded one called Happy Not Perfect. I used it at work the other day when I needed to focus on writing, and even though Maureen Dowd\u2019s assistant was in the background yelling about a moose that got hit by a fast-moving car, I turned back to my piece refreshed.\\r\\nWhat tech product is on your holiday wish list?\\r\\nUgh.

But is the risk of getting caught worth it?\\r\\nThe recent news that the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission are looking at the accounting and disclosures of General Electric, Tesla and Snap does not bode well for the companies. An investigation of possibly faulty accounting typically looks deep into corporate books and public statements, and the government rarely commits resources without evidence that there may be significant misstatements.\\r\\nRegulators are suspicious.\\r\\nG.E. has been under scrutiny since January for an insurance charge totaling $15 billion over seven years related to long-term care and other policies. In October, the company announced a $22 billion accounting charge to write down the value of its power business. A division rarely loses that much value overnight. The S.E.C. and Justice Department expanded their investigations to include the latest charge, most likely to determine whether G.E. delayed recognizing such a sizable hit in the hope its fortunes would improve and allow it to avoid dealing with the problems.\\r\\nTesla already settled a securities fraud lawsuit with the S.E.C. over improper tweets by Elon Musk, its chief executive, about potentially taking the company private. That case revealed a broader investigation of the company about how it forecast production of its Model 3 sedan in 2017, including disclosure that the S.E.C. issued a subpoena about production rate projections for the vehicle.\\r\\nSnap disclosed that the S.E.C. and Justice Department sent it subpoenas for records related to its disclosure about competition from Instagram when it went public in March 2017. Regulators are investigating whether the company understated the impact of Instagram on its own growth \u2014 a key issue for investors in a tech company built around rapid user growth.\\r\\nWhat happens next?\\r\\nUnsurprisingly, all three companies vowed to cooperate with the government. Snap has taken the position that its disclosures were \u201caccurate and complete,\u201d while Tesla asserted that \u201cto our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred.\u201d Companies generally provide little information about how an investigation is progressing until they obtain a clear picture from the government about what might have gone awry.\\r\\nAccounting investigations can take months, or even years, to be resolved. That leaves investors with uncertainty as investigators pore over corporate records and try to build a case \u2014 and little hobbles a company\u2019s stock price more than investor uncertainty.\\r\\nThe presence of the Justice Department in all three investigations intensifies the pressure. Under a provision of the federal securities law, any person or company that \u201cwillfully and knowingly\u201d makes a false statement in any report filed with the S.E.C. can be prosecuted. Another rule makes it a violation for a company to \u201cfalsify or cause to be falsified, any book, record or account.\u201d Unlike a securities fraud claim, which requires proving an intent to mislead investors, accounting violations only require proof that false information was incorporated into corporate documents and financial statements \u2014 a much easier standard to meet.\\r\\nUnlike S.E.C. regulators, who typically settle cases without an admission or denial of liability, federal prosecutors generally require a company to acknowledge its violations in a statement of facts that is then incorporated into a deferred prosecution agreement. Any resolution of a criminal case, even if the company does not have to plead guilty, means that investors will be able to piggyback on the acknowledgment in private securities fraud lawsuits. That could add to the cost of any penalty that might be imposed.\\r\\nWarren Buffett once pointed out that \u201cyou only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out.\u201d But when your competitors are posting record profits and sales, the incentive to make yourself appear better can be very tempting, at least as long as the tide is high.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1435074447,\"description\":\"The companies can expect hobbled stock prices as the investigations play out, with penalties and private lawsuits if regulators identify wrongdoing.\\r\",\"title\":\"White Collar Watch: G.E., Tesla and Snap Are Under Accounting Investigation.

He downgraded a meeting with one ally and postponed one with another. He exchanged icy smiles with the prime minister of Canada, who had threatened to skip the signing of a new trade agreement with the United States and Mexico because of lingering bitterness over steel tariffs.\\r\\nAnd President Trump was preoccupied by legal clouds back home, tweeting angrily that there was nothing illicit about his business ventures in Russia, a day after his former lawyer Michael D. Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the extent and duration of those dealings.\\r\\nFor Mr. Trump, his first day at the summit meeting of the Group of 20 industrialized nations in Buenos Aires was a window into his idiosyncratic statecraft after nearly two years in office. His \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy has not become \u201cAmerica Alone\u201d exactly, but it has left him with a strange patchwork of partners at these global gatherings.\\r\\nMr. Trump canceled a meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, citing the country\u2019s recent naval clash with Ukraine. Nor did he meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, though he did exchange pleasantries with the prince, whom he has pulled close despite charges that the prince had a role in the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\\r\\nThe president did meet with the leaders of two Pacific allies, Australia and Japan, as well as with the prime minister of India. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most eager courtiers among foreign leaders, congratulated him on his \u201chistoric victory in the midterm election\u201d \u2014 an election in which Democrats seized control of the House.\\r\\nStill, in purely social terms, Mr. Trump\u2019s day may well have peaked at 7:30 a.m. when he greeted Argentina\u2019s president, Mauricio Macri, at the Casa Rosada. The pink presidential palace is famous for the balcony from which Eva Per\u00f3n once spoke to adoring crowds in the plaza below.\\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known each other a long time,\u201d said Mr. Trump, who was involved in a Manhattan real estate deal with Mr. Macri\u2019s father in the 1980s. \u201cThat was in my civilian days,\u201d said a nostalgic president, who has talked recently about how much he misses his hometown.\\r\\nThe Group of 20 is a motley congregation under any circumstances, divided between liberal democratic leaders, who are greater in number, and autocrats, who often drive the agenda. Mr. Trump, who was making his second visit to the G-20, dramatizes its split nature, having alienated European allies and cultivated friendly ties with several of the strongmen.\\r\\nThis year, however, the autocrats proved as problematic as the allies. Despite professing his loyalty to Prince Mohammed only two weeks ago, Mr. Trump did not find time for a formal session with him. The president\u2019s national security adviser, John R. Bolton, chalked up the omission to Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cfull to overflowing\u201d schedule of meetings with other leaders.\\r\\nWhen the president encountered Prince Mohammed on the sidelines of the meeting, \u201cthey exchanged pleasantries,\u201d according to a White House official, as Mr. Trump did \u201cwith nearly every leader in attendance.\u201d Mr. Trump later told reporters: \u201cWe had no discussion. We might, but we had none.\u201d\\r\\nAs if to prove that the prince was not persona non grata, Saudi Arabia\u2019s Foreign Ministry posted photos of him chatting with President Emmanuel Macron of France, President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico and President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, though not Mr. Trump. He even exchanged a modified high-five with Mr. Putin before they sat down next to each other at the first session of the leaders.\\r\\nThen there was the president\u2019s frustrated bromance with Mr. Putin, one of the other mini-soap operas that flavored the meeting. After months of trying to arrange another date, Mr. Trump abruptly and unhappily pulled the plug on a scheduled meeting with Mr. Putin in Buenos Aires, citing the recent escalation in Russian tensions with Ukraine.\\r\\nThe Kremlin, which learned about the cancellation via Twitter, like the rest of the world, has been tweaking Mr. Trump in response. A Russian official told reporters that the real reason Mr. Trump canceled was the revelation that he had been trying to build a tower in Moscow much later into his presidential campaign than previously acknowledged.\\r\\nOn Friday, Mr. Trump insisted again to reporters that the meeting was scrapped \u201con the basis of what took place with respect to the ships and the sailors. That was the sole reason.\u201d Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, lamented the crossed signals. \u201cLove can\u2019t be forced,\u201d he said.\\r\\nMr. Trump is sticking to a plan to have a working dinner with President Xi Jinping of China on Saturday. And he expressed more optimism about reaching some kind of compromise with China to ease its escalating trade dispute with the United States.\\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019re working very hard,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIf we can make a deal, that\u2019d be good. I think they want to. I think we\u2019d like to.\u201d\\r\\nOn Saturday, he is to have a rescheduled meeting with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, who arrived late on a commercial flight after an emergency landing of her government plane in Cologne.\\r\\nBut he downgraded a meeting with another ally, Mr. Moon of South Korea, to a \u201cpull aside,\u201d diplomatic jargon for a less formal encounter. The White House did not say why it had made that change, though Mr. Trump\u2019s nuclear diplomacy with North Korea has bogged down in recent weeks. The White House said Mr. Trump is still hoping for a follow-up summit meeting with President Kim Jong-un of North Korea.\\r\\nTo some experts, Mr. Trump\u2019s truncated schedule represented a new phase in his unorthodox approach to statecraft.\\r\\n\u201cIn previous meetings, Trump has been more focused on undermining the very notion of a global agenda, let alone affirming the U.S.\u2019s leadership role in defining it,\u201d said Vali R. Nasr, the dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. \u201cBut in this one, with the exception of his working dinner with Xi, he is not even doing the key bilateral meetings.\u201d\\r\\nWilliam J. Burns, who served as deputy secretary of state in the Obama administration, said Mr. Trump was dismissive of traditional diplomacy and appeared distracted by the investigation of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia.\\r\\n\u201cThe net result is not just a missed opportunity,\u201d Mr. Burns said, \u201cbut the acceleration of international disorder and the long-term weakening of American influence.\u201d\\r\\nStill, other former diplomats said the heavy focus on face-to-face meetings at these gatherings was overblown.\\r\\n\u201cThe president came to office believing that personal relations among leaders were a central part of international relations,\u201d said Elliott Abrams, who has worked for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. \u201cI believe he has found that most foreign leaders will not allow personal likes or dislikes to affect policy, and that national policies are most often driven by history, geography and bureaucratic decision-making.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cSo,\u201d he added, \u201cmeetings at the top often become less critical.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-691696041,\"description\":\"At the Group of 20 gathering in Buenos Aires, President Trump declined to meet with his two favorite strongmen, postponed meeting an ally and was preoccupied with the Russia investigation.\\r\",\"title\":\"Dodging Friends, Chased by Legal Troubles, Trump Navigates G-20\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"world.5.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Nearly five years ago, in my very first State of the Art column, I offered a straightforward plan for how to survive what was shaping up to be a turbulent time in the tech world.\\r\\nAt the time, technology felt thrilling and world-changing. You could use a smartphone to call up a car as if you were some kind of baller. You could video-chat with people anywhere in the world, like \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d \u2014 and maybe some of those people would use the new tech to throw off the yoke of repression, somehow. They were the days of miracle and wonder. \\r\\nBut tech also felt confusing. There were so many new things \u2014 every year, new phones with so much more power, made by so many new companies, all running so many new and purportedly revolutionary apps \u2014 that it was easy to get lost in the hype. It was also easy to pick the wrong horse. There was no guarantee that this or that novelty would last until next year.\\r\\nSo to get the most out of innovations and avoid betting on the also-rans, my inaugural advice to readers was to follow these steps: Buy hardware from Apple. Use online services made by Google. And get digital media from Amazon.\\r\\nNow the time has come to amend and update that advice \u2014 which is fitting, because this will be my final column in these pages. (I\u2019m not going far: I\u2019ll be writing for The New York Times\u2019s Opinion section starting next year.)\\r\\nThe tech industry in 2018 is far more consequential than it was in 2014, when I started this job. It\u2019s bigger, more pervasive and in every way more dangerous. It is also less amenable to outside pressure: The companies that run the show are more powerful than ever, and in many cases governments \u2014 especially in the United States \u2014 have proved ineffective at curbing their excesses.\\r\\nHow should you, as an ethical and upstanding user of tech, navigate this misbegotten industry? I offer three new maxims for surviving the next era of tech. I hope you heed them; the world rides on your choices.\\r\\nDon\u2019t just look at the product. Look at the business model. \\r\\nNot long ago \u2014 in the nascent days of smartphones, mobile apps and the mysterious \u201ccloud\u201d \u2014 wading into the market for new tech was often risky. You might buy a phone or tablet whose maker would quickly go belly-up. A lot of stuff didn\u2019t work well: Backing up your data was a headache, keeping your photos organized across different devices was a nightmare. And even technologies that did work left you plagued with guilt and worry. Remember the curse of email spam, or how you had to pay through the nose for texting?\\r\\nSomething strange and unexpected has happened in the last five years: A lot of tech got pretty good. Slowly but surely, many of our basic struggles were fixed. Nothing is perfect, but for most people, the mobile era has brought simplicity to tech for the first time.\\r\\nBut ubiquitous quality has given rise to a new problem: If everything just works, how are you supposed to choose what to buy?\\r\\nMy advice: Don\u2019t just consider how well a product works, but look at who\u2019s making it and how it is sold. Before you dive into any new doodad, consider a company\u2019s ethics, morals, branding and messaging. If you aren\u2019t comfortable, look to alternatives. (Last year, for instance, I switched to Lyft from Uber, and I\u2019ve never looked back.) Most important, when you\u2019re choosing tech, it\u2019s wise to consider the business model \u2014 because it\u2019s in the buying and the selling of a product, rather than in the using, that you can best figure out its dangers.\\r\\nFor instance: Even though Google\u2019s Pixel line of phones is very good \u2014 a far more affordable option with some features that iPhone users might kill for \u2014 I stick with Apple\u2019s phones because I appreciate the simplicity of the trade. I pay Apple a huge sum of money for the device, and it takes extraordinary care in protecting me from some of the worst digital scourges.\\r\\nI don\u2019t doubt Google\u2019s capacity to make great devices. But because Google makes most of its money from ads, and because the internet ad business lies at the heart of just about every terrible thing online, I\u2019d rather not fall deeper into that swamp.\\r\\nSimilarly, I found Facebook\u2019s new video-chatting machine, Portal, to be very good, but I\u2019ll never buy it. Besides Facebook\u2019s dependence on targeted ads, the company has repeatedly breached its users\u2019 trust, not to mention the casual disregard it has shown for larger ideas like democracy. Portal is nice, but it\u2019s not that nice.\\r\\nAvoid feeding the giants.\\r\\nOne thing that hasn\u2019t changed in the last five years is who\u2019s running the show. When I started writing this column, Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft were tech\u2019s biggest and most influential companies. Today, even with recent stock-market troubles, the same five giants sit at the top of the world.\\r\\nI\u2019ve railed against this sort of concentration again and again \u2014 the tech giants\u2019 increasing domination ruins innovation, undermines consumer choice and generally makes a lot of the industry ungovernable. Lawmakers around the world are now taking notice, and it\u2019s possible that in the next five years, we\u2019ll see greater regulatory curbs to the behemoths\u2019 size and scope.\\r\\nBut you don\u2019t have to wait for politicians to weigh in. Your choices as a consumer matter, too \u2014 and for a better, healthier tech industry, it\u2019s best to avoid mindlessly feeding the giants whenever you can. If you have a choice between something made by one of the Big Five and some indie brand, choose the indie.\\r\\nHere\u2019s one example: Even though I like Apple\u2019s hardware and appreciate its business model, I\u2019ve stayed away from Apple Music, its subscription streaming service. For me, Spotify is superior in just about every way. Its app works better (its music recommendation algorithm is eerily good), it releases innovative features at a faster clip, and its songs play on more types of devices.\\r\\nBest of all, Spotify is an independent company. So when I pay for it, I am, in a small way, spreading the wealth in the industry. \\r\\nThere are some downsides to this. Apple has shamelessly given its own service priority on its devices \u2014 so Siri, for example, will play music from Apple\u2019s service but not from Spotify. But it\u2019s precisely this sort of mischief that I\u2019m hoping to dissuade by putting my money elsewhere.\\r\\nThere are lots of other examples for looking beyond the big guys. You can use Dropbox instead of storing all your stuff with Apple and Google. Rather than Microsoft Word or Google Docs, I write in Ulysses, a lightweight composing app that is faster and more elegant than any big-tech competitor. Whatever tech you\u2019re in the market for, there\u2019s most likely some innovative thing made by a non-giant that deserves consideration, if not your money.\\r\\nAdopt late. Slow down. \\r\\nOne reason the tech industry feels as terrible as it now does is that many of us failed to appreciate the collective power of our choices. Ten years ago, smartphones looked like fun gadgets and social media seemed like a harmless pastime \u2014 and few saw the implications for society in their ubiquity, not least the people running the companies and making this stuff.\\r\\nThe lesson of the last decade is that our private tech choices can alter economies and societies. They matter. And they matter most in the mindless rush, when everyone seems to be jumping on board the latest new thing, because it\u2019s in these heady moments that we lose sight of the precise risks of turning ourselves over to tech.\\r\\nThat\u2019s why the most important lesson I\u2019ve gleaned in writing this column is this: Just slow down. Don\u2019t jump on the newest thing. If it isn\u2019t plagued with bugs or security nightmares, some other unexpected, emergent risk probably lies within it \u2014 and whatever its short-term benefits, you may live to regret it.\\r\\nYes, tech could make everything better. But we should be on guard for the ways it could make things worse \u2014 how self-driving cars could induce sprawl, how the \u201cinternet of things\u201d could provoke apocalypse, how social media could ruin democracy.\\r\\nAre these unlikely dangers? Maybe. But we live in unpredictable times. The unlikely happens. Be careful. Go slow.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1729538882,\"description\":\"In his final State of the Art column, Farhad Manjoo reflects on the industry\u2019s changes and presents a new guide for navigating the future of technology.\\r\",\"title\":\"State of the Art: How to Survive the Next Era of Tech (Slow Down and Be Mindful)\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"technology.16.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"In an effort to shed more light on how we work, The Times is running a series of short posts explaining some of our journalistic practices. Read more of this series here. \\r\\nThis month The New York Times won a libel suit brought by an Ohio State professor over this investigative story. Here, David McCraw, deputy general counsel at The Times, talks about the paper's history of handling libel claims.\\r\\nThe undertaker was drunk.\\r\\nAt least that is what The New York Times said. The year was 1886, and The Times was reporting on a simmering public dispute between the family of Ulysses S. Grant and an undertaker from Saratoga Springs, N.Y., who showed up, apparently sauced, to take charge of the former president\u2019s body on July 23, 1885. Not surprisingly, the Grant family declined to pay his bill (an \u201cexorbitant and unjust\u201d $500), and the whole sorry episode became the subject of a Times article. \\r\\nThat was when the undertaker, one Ebenezer Holmes, sued The Times for libel, joining the long parade of unhappy people who have lodged libel complaints against The Times over the course of the paper\u2019s 167-year history.\\r\\nWhile the Holmes case long ago faded into oblivion, it still captures the essence of a libel claim: A person dissatisfied with his portrayal in the paper comes to court to make the case that the article was false, his reputation has been harmed and only an award of damages can set things right.\\r\\nMuch has changed about libel in the 130 years since undertaker Holmes undertook to sue The Times. For one thing, libel litigation has become relatively rare, at least for The Times. For example, between 2010 and 2017, The Times had 11 libel suits, all but one of them filed in the United States. The plaintiffs have ranged from college professors and a coal industry magnate to a junior high principal, a onetime candidate for vice president and an F.B.I. informant. The one case filed abroad was brought in Moscow by a close Putin chum. No surprise how that one turned out: We lost.\\r\\nThe Times has fared slightly better in the United States: The newspaper has not lost a libel case brought over one of its articles for at least 50 years. Much of the legal credit for that goes to a Times court decision that has not been forgotten: Times v. Sullivan, the 1964 Supreme Court opinion that revolutionized the law of libel. \\r\\nSullivan was a 9-0 smackdown of plaintiffs who saw libel suits as a legal extortion racket to be used to silence publishers. L.B. Sullivan, the plaintiff, was a police commissioner in Montgomery, Ala. He sued The Times over an ad from supporters of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who had bought space in the paper to protest the violence being visited upon civil rights demonstrators in the South \u2014 in particular, the police misconduct during a protest in Montgomery. \\r\\nSullivan claimed that the ad had besmirched his good name (even though he wasn\u2019t mentioned) and persuaded an Alabama jury to hit The New York Times with a $500,000 verdict. It was one of dozens of libel suits being used by Southern power brokers to try to silence the press.\\r\\nBy the time the case reached the Supreme Court, the justices had seen enough. \u201cThis technique for harassing and punishing a free press \u2014 now that it has been shown to be possible \u2014 is by no means limited to cases with racial overtones; it can be used in other fields where public feelings may make local as well as out-of-state newspapers easy prey for libel verdict seekers,\u201d one of the justices wrote. \\r\\nThe court famously held that public officials, and later all public figures, would need to show not just that an article was inaccurate and hurt their reputation, but also that the publisher acted with \u201cactual malice\u201d \u2014 with reckless disregard for the truth. It is a demanding standard, effectively requiring plaintiffs to show that editors knew a story was false, or had serious doubts about its accuracy, and published it anyway.\\r\\nSullivan led to a series of other court decisions that curtailed the ability of libel plaintiffs to win their lawsuits. None of it was intended to be a balancing. It was an imbalancing, a conscious decision by the courts to free journalists to pursue the truth without fear of triggering a lawsuit that could bankrupt their publisher. The Sullivan decision, like the First Amendment itself, was anchored in the belief that competing voices rather than lawsuits were the best way to get at the truth. The Times has long believed that as well. Its policy of not paying money to plaintiffs to settle libel suits in the United States against the newspaper traces back to a 1922 letter written by the publisher.\\r\\nAs powerful as Sullivan has been in curbing libel suits, it doesn\u2019t really change the way newspaper lawyers go about their jobs. We still want to know whether the undertaker was really drunk and how our reporters came to know that. No lawyer here has ever reviewed a story draft, concluded it was a factual wreck and then declared it was good to go because the reporter didn\u2019t have a reckless disregard for the truth. Whatever the Supreme Court may have said in Sullivan, getting it right is still what matters.\\r\\nAt The Times, Legal is asked every day to review articles and videos in advance of publication. Over time, trends emerge. We will almost always be focused on a story\u2019s minor players, who tend to be the people most likely to sue. They are often unhappy to be in an article about someone else\u2019s misconduct, have grievances about context or feel they should have been given more of a say. We spend lots of time considering the line between opinion (which is legally protected) and fact (which can give rise to a libel suit). And nothing more bedevils lawyers and editors than claims for \u201clibel by implication\u201d \u2014 when the facts may be right but a plaintiff says that the story implied something defamatory. \\r\\nUndertaker Holmes\u2019s case involved no such legal subtleties. At trial, The Times tried to prove he was drunk. That didn\u2019t work out so well. Holmes won a $3,500 verdict. The Times soldiered on and finally got the verdict set aside on appeal \u2014 after nine years of litigating. Then as now, the decision makers at The Times thought the journalism was worth defending.\\r\\nA note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.\\r\\nFollow the @ReaderCenter on Twitter for more coverage highlighting your perspectives and experiences and for insight into how we work. \\r\\nDavid McCraw is vice president and deputy general counsel of The New York Times.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-223316604,\"description\":\"In Times v.

He was 92.\\r\\nHis death was reported by British newspapers and by the Medical Research Council\u2019s Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England, where Dr. Klug had worked for decades. It did not say where he died.\\r\\nTrained as a physicist, Dr. Klug \u2014 Lithuanian-born and raised in South Africa \u2014 became interested in the 1960s in how techniques to discern the structure of crystals could be applied to biology. Initially he bounced X-rays off biological molecules, but in the mid-1960s he switched to electrons.\\r\\nElectron microscopy can make out tiny features as small as atoms, but it requires that samples be placed in a vacuum \u2014 an unfriendly environment for almost all components of living organisms.\\r\\nDr. Klug and his collaborators worked around that issue by using heavy metals to encase the molecules. In an interview, Richard Henderson, a colleague of Dr. Klug\u2019s at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology, explained the process:\\r\\n\u201cYou did a mold like a plaster of Paris mold of your hand, and then you could determine the structure of the plaster of Paris, and then, by implication, you\u2019d find out the structure of what was inside it. That\u2019s what they did in the \u203260s.\u201d\\r\\nBy making electron images from different directions, Dr. Klug was able to construct three-dimensional images.\\r\\nX-rays, not electron microscopy, was the primary method to decipher protein structures until recent years, when researchers figured out that freezing the molecules could preserve their structure. Dr. Klug was not involved with the latest advances, but \u201cthe mathematics behind it is the same mathematics that was developed in the \u203260s by Aaron Klug,\u201d Dr. Henderson said.\\r\\nThe Nobel committee cited Dr. Klug \u201cfor his development of crystallographic electron microscopy and his structural elucidation of biologically important nucleic acid-protein complexes.\u201d\\r\\nAaron Klug was born in Lithuania on Aug. 11, 1926. When he was 2, his family emigrated to South Africa, a more welcoming environment for Jews at the time. He enrolled at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg at the age of 15.\\r\\nAfter graduating with a bachelor of science degree, he obtained a master\u2019s degree at the University of Cape Town and then moved to England in 1949 to study at the University of Cambridge. He finished a doctorate there in 1953.\\r\\nDr. Klug, whose research had focused mostly on bouncing X-rays off crystals to determine their structure, had received an offer of a postdoctoral fellowship in Philadelphia at the Johnson Foundation for Medical Physics. He e was denied a visa, however, because a student organization he had belonged to in South Africa was deemed Communist. Instead he took a position at Birkbeck College in London to work on studying proteins using X-ray crystallography.\\r\\nThere he met Rosalind Franklin, whose X-ray images of DNA were crucial to Francis Crick and James D. Watson\u2019s figuring out the double helical structure of the molecule in the early 1950s.\\r\\nWhen Dr. Klug encountered her, in 1954, she was applying the same techniques to viruses, and the images enchanted Dr. Klug.\\r\\n\u201cThat determined, really, my scientific career, because up to then I hadn\u2019t had a firm idea of what I wanted to do,\u201d he said in an interview  for the Nobel Foundation in 2001. He switched to studying the structures of viruses.\\r\\nDr. Klug joined the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in 1962 and started working on the electron microscopy techniques.\\r\\nHe also moved on to other topics of research, spending six to eight years on one before switching to another. \u201cI think he quite liked the challenge of having some completely new problem to work on,\u201d Dr. Henderson said.\\r\\nDr. Klug was at the forefront of determining the structure of transfer RNA, a type of RNA molecule that helps decode the instructions for producing a protein. He studied chromatin, which holds the long strands of DNA in tight packages within a nucleus, and he discovered \u201czinc fingers,\u201d molecular motifs that can bind to specific DNA sequences. He also studied tangles of proteins associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\\r\\nDr. Klug acknowledged that he preferred being a pioneer in his research as opposed to expanding on others\u2019 work.\\r\\n\u201cAlmost everything I\u2019ve worked on, after I started, other people moved in and did all sorts of useful work,\u201d he told the Nobel Foundation. \u201cBut by then I\u2019d moved on to something else, because people jump in when they see something good and spoil the fun, really.\u201d\\r\\nDr. Klug was director of the laboratory from 1986 to 1996 and played a key role in establishing what is now the Wellcome Sanger Institute in England, which completed about a third of the sequencing of the Human Genome Project.

Although stocks surged on Wednesday, a rocky autumn wiped out most of the year\u2019s gains, and investors are having difficulty mustering arguments for a market that has been unable to sustain upward momentum.\\r\\nPaul Hickey, a founder of Bespoke Investment Group, an independent market research firm, regularly tallies what he calls \u201cthe pros and cons\u201d of the stock market. I asked him for an informal update: He came up with 14 pros versus 22 cons.\\r\\nThat abundance of negativity isn\u2019t intended as a quantitative assessment of the market\u2019s prospects, but it does give a rough sense of his view and, I think, of the perspective of many skittish investors.\\r\\n\u201cWe were bullish for a long time, but right now I\u2019d say I\u2019m in a wait-and-see mode,\u201d Mr. Hickey said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a time to be cautious.\u201d\\r\\nI also asked James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist of the Leuthold Group, an investment research firm in Minneapolis, for his sense of the market. An economist, Mr. Paulsen is worried about stocks because he is worried about the economy, he said. While the United States is not in a recession now, he said, \u201cwe have moved into the ballpark of a recession.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Paulsen said neither he nor anyone else could reliably forecast a recession. \u201cThat kind of prediction is just too hard to do,\u201d he said. But, he added, it is possible to judge when the risks of recession have risen.\\r\\n\u201cIt gets somewhat easy, with a little experience, to recognize when you\u2019re in the ballpark of a recession,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. \u201cThat is where we are now, and that alone is quite a bit of information.\u201d\\r\\nGiven his current outlook, which is that the probability of a recession within two years is reasonably high though not certain, \u201cthis is a good moment to take a little risk out of your portfolio, just in case things turn down,\u201d he said.\\r\\nThe stock market, Mr. Paulsen said, often moves in advance of a recession \u2014 and a declining market can help cause a recession \u2014 making investment timing extremely difficult now. In this dangerous environment, he said, \u201cright now, I\u2019d be a little careful.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Hickey, too, advises caution, because when he enumerates the pros and cons for the market, the positive side is scanty. It includes factors like these:\\r\\n\u25a0 Despite some difficulties, the gross domestic product in the United States rose at a 3.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter.\\r\\n\u25a0 The Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Indicators index has been rising, which suggests that a recession is probably not imminent.\\r\\n\u25a0 The yield curve \u2014 the difference between long- and short-term interest rates \u2014 remains in a bullish zone, although that positive margin has been narrowing and bears close watching.\\r\\n\u25a0 The end of the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate tightening cycle may be in sight. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman, said on Wednesday that interest rates were already close to a \u201cneutral\u201d level, which might imply that rates won\u2019t rise much higher.\\r\\n\u25a0 Finally, there is already so much bad news about the stock market that it amounts to good news. According to contrarian logic, Mr. Hickey said, the negatives are baked into stock prices, so the market has room to rise.\\r\\nThat last item may be a stretch. It is an indication, he said, that he is having difficulty being upbeat.\\r\\nThe stock market negatives on Mr. Hickey\u2019s list, by contrast, are straightforward. A sampling includes these items:\\r\\n\u25a0 The trend of stock prices has been quite negative. While a string of strong days could turn that around, momentum is bearish.\\r\\n\u25a0 Despite Mr. Powell\u2019s latest comments, the Fed is still tightening monetary policy, which could easily derail the stock market and the economy.\\r\\n\u25a0 The fiscal stimulus provided by the tax cut is, increasingly, behind us. Combined with tighter monetary policy, the loss of fiscal stimulus could hurt the American economy.\\r\\n\u25a0 Tariffs have been rising, and business sentiment has been depressed by the prospect of widening trade wars.\\r\\n\u25a0 Global economic growth has been slowing, and many stock markets around the world are already in bear market territory.\\r\\n\u25a0 The domestic housing market has weakened, homebuilder stocks have plunged, commodity prices have fallen, and auto sales are relatively weak.\\r\\n\u25a0 The tech sector, which propelled the market higher earlier in the year, has now lost hundreds of billions of dollars in value. Because of the importance of stocks like Amazon, Facebook, Netflix, Alphabet (Google) and Apple, the psychological \u201cimpact of their weakness can\u2019t be overstated,\u201d Mr. Hickey said.\\r\\n\u25a0 Corporate debt levels are high, creating new vulnerabilities.\\r\\n\u25a0 The rate of earnings growth is likely to decline. That could disappoint Wall Street analysts and shake up the market.\\r\\nAnd that\u2019s just a start. The negatives go on and on.\\r\\nIn the 10th year of both an economic expansion and a great bull market, of course, it\u2019s not surprising that warning signals have begun to flash. At this stage, as I wrote recently, it seems wise to be prepared for downturns.\\r\\nYet even despite these portents, a gloomy financial outlook may not be entirely appropriate. For example, neither Mr. Hickey nor Mr. Paulsen is confident that the bull market is over or that a recession is likely to arrive soon.\\r\\n\u201cThere could be another strong bull run,\u201d Mr. Hickey said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have a good sense of that until at least the end of the year.\u201d\\r\\nI asked Mr. Paulsen to make the strongest case he reasonably could for upbeat economic and market outcomes for the next two years. In response, he said it was possible that the Fed would soften its monetary policy enough to extend the economic recovery and bolster the stock market. If the economy keeps growing and corporate earnings keep rising, Mr. Paulsen said, stocks will rise, too.\\r\\nThe odd conditions of 2018 have already made stock valuations more attractive. Because prices have been flat while earnings have risen, the price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 has declined to about 18, from about 23.5 in January, he pointed out.\\r\\nIf that trend continues, Mr. Paulsen said, stocks might become rather enticing. \u201cIf we don\u2019t go into a recession and if interest rates don\u2019t rise too much, at some point stocks could look good enough to set off another bull run,\u201d he said.\\r\\nBut he added that he wouldn\u2019t bet on it with money needed to pay the bills in the next couple of years.\\r\\nAfter a nearly 10-year bull run, the downside of the market is becoming increasingly obvious.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1112125808,\"description\":\"When the pros and cons for stocks and the economy over the next year or two are weighed, the risks appear to be dominant, our columnist says.\\r\",\"title\":\"Strategies: The Stock Market\u2019s Dangers Are Easier to See Now\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"business.7.txt\"}],\"labelMap\":[[61447848,\"technology\"],[-2095820065,\"science\"],[1019667238,\"science\"],[1931849565,\"world\"],[1078252366,\"business\"],[400461459,\"business\"],[-1869905367,\"science\"],[-580549357,\"business\"],[-592673859,\"business\"],[1700442999,\"world\"],[-528635622,\"business\"],[621865068,\"business\"],[659434478,\"business\"],[1868053907,\"science\"],[-2031516889,\"technology\"],[-1233719476,\"business\"],[1131488870,\"health\"],[472079094,\"business\"],[275771711,\"business\"],[-1872930463,\"health\"],[2048410531,\"world\"],[-589719920,\"health\"],[-858981003,\"technology\"],[879478674,\"world\"],[2013679192,\"business\"],[1866762071,\"business\"],[-234078885,\"health\"],[-1578760496,\"business\"],[1290383668,\"world\"],[-1435074447,\"business\"],[-691696041,\"business\"],[-1729538882,\"business\"],[-223316604,\"world\"],[298995085,\"world\"],[1112125808,\"business\"]],\"confusionMatrix\":[[5,2,0,0,0],[5,0,1,0,1],[1,0,1,2,3],[4,0,0,1,2],[2,2,2,0,1]],\"confusionLabels\":[\"business\",\"health\",\"science\",\"technology\",\"world\"],\"relabelingLabelMap\":[],\"accuracy\":0.22857142857142856,\"correctRelabeled\":[],\"labelingPrecision\":null,\"labelingRecall\":0,\"correctAssignedItems\":[],\"assignmentPrecision\":null,\"openedItems\":[],\"numOpenedItems\":0,\"selectedItems\":[2013679192,-1233719476,472079094,621865068,1019667238,-287299375,1661884965,-1402549333,2146958515,-1181703224,252720659],\"selectedInCategory\":4,\"selectionRecall\":0.4444444444444444},{\"modelOperation\":\"add\",\"changedFiles\":[{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Once upon a time, everyone hoped that the internet, instead of becoming a bottomless pit of iniquity, would be filled with good and interesting information about large cattle. \\r\\nAnd lo, it is. \\r\\nBut the viral photos of Knickers, the very large Australian steer, perhaps the largest steer around, have raised more questions than a leak from the Mueller investigation. The main one being, how did he get to be 6 feet 4 inches at the shoulder, and weigh about 3,000 pounds, so big that he escaped the abattoir. The answer seems to be if you\u2019re a good-sized Holstein steer and you live long enough, you too could be a contender. \\r\\nWhat are Holsteins? \\r\\nThey are the Ben and Jerry cows, black and white. They are bred to produce milk. The breed is 2,000 years old and originated in Europe. They are also raised for their meat, and, since Knickers was a steer (a castrated bull), he unfortunately had no future in the dairy business.\\r\\nHow big do cattle usually grow?\\r\\nIt depends on the breed. According to Daren M. Sheffield, production records specialist at the Holstein Association USA, the average Holstein cow is about 4 feet, 10 inches tall at the shoulder and weighs about 1,500 pounds. Steers are usually slaughtered around 15 months at a weight of 1,300 to 1,400 pounds. It is rare for a steer to reach seven years of age. \\r\\nBut, Mr. Sheffield said, \u201cSteers can grow to tremendous sizes at a mature age. It was not uncommon for Holstein cattle raised as oxen to reach weights of 3,000 pounds.\u201d Oxen are steers raised for work like plowing.\\r\\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\\r\\nAnd what about bulls?\\r\\nMr. Sheffield said the averages for Holstein bulls are less well known, but they do reach 6 feet and weigh up to 2500 pounds. \u201cMature steers such as Knickers can reach heavier weights than the average bull,\u201d he said.\\r\\nBulls of other breeds can grow a lot bigger, though. A few years ago, Britain\u2019s biggest bull, of a different breed, was 7 feet tall and weighed 4,000 pounds. \\r\\nWhat determines size for cattle?\\r\\nGenes contribute to size, but exactly which genes and how is not clear. In humans, there are many genes and genomic regions involved in determining height. In dogs, a few regions predominate.\\r\\nAn analysis earlier this year of cattle genomes concluded that cattle are more like humans than dogs. The researchers looked at genetic data from almost 60,000 cattle and found 163 gene variants contributing to height. All those gene areas accounted for less than 14 percent of height variation. Other contributors to size are food, environment and age. \\r\\nHow unusual is a 6-foot-4 Holstein?\\r\\nIn 2016, the Daily Mail in Britain featured a Holstein steer in California named Daniel that was purported to be 6 feet 4 inches tall. \\r\\nA Holstein named Blossom, who died in 2015 at the age of 13, is still listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the tallest cow ever at 6 foot 2.8 inches. Also in 2016, the Daily Mail, which seems to love large bovines, had a story on Big Moo, then considered perhaps the biggest steer. Big Moo also lived in Australia. \\r\\nAsked if Knickers was really that unusual, Mr. Sheffield sounded less than enthusiastic, \u201cIt\u2019s rare to see an animal like that because they\u2019re not kept that long.\u201d\\r\\n\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":771271037,\"description\":\"It also helps to be castrated and live a long time.\\r\",\"title\":\"What Makes Knickers the Steer (Not Cow) So Big?

An ocean away, the corporate titan\u2019s problems were on show at the Group of 20 summit meeting: President Emmanuel Macron of France, where Renault is based, met with Japan\u2019s prime minister to discuss the alliance.\\r\\nMr. Ghosn, a charismatic leader in the auto industry, is being investigated after a whistle-blower within Nissan, the Japanese automaker, alleged he vastly understated his compensation on securities filings. He has been in detention since Nov. 19, when he was arrested on his private jet soon after landing at Tokyo\u2019s Haneda Airport.\\r\\nMr. Ghosn, who forged the alliance as a groundbreaking industry model for sharing technology and cost savings, has yet to be charged. But the Nissan board voted unanimously to fire him as chairman last week. Mitsubishi Motors, a Japanese automaker that joined the alliance in 2016, removed him as its chairman on Monday.\\r\\nGreg Kelly, Mr. Ghosn\u2019s former chief of staff and a Nissan board member, who was arrested at the same time, will also be detained for 10 more days. A former head of human resources and an American, Mr. Kelly has been described by the company as a \u201cmastermind\u201d of the alleged financial wrongdoing. Both men were in Tokyo for a board meeting.\\r\\nUnder Japanese law, prosecutors can detain suspects for up to 22 days without filing charges, and can legally question them without a lawyer present.\\r\\nThe extended detentions give the Japanese authorities more time to interrogate the men, search Nissan\u2019s offices for evidence and determine whether to press charges. Prosecutors have said they suspect Mr. Ghosn earned around 10 billion yen, or about $88 million, at Nissan from 2011 to 2015 but reported only half of it. The other half was to be parceled out as deferred compensation after Mr. Ghosn, 64, retired.\\r\\nMr. Kelly is also alleged to have overseen the surreptitious purchase of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of housing for his boss through a Dutch company, Zi-A Capital, whose financial reports are opaque. Mr. Ghosn kept homes in Paris, Amsterdam, Rio de Janeiro and Beirut, Lebanon.\\r\\nDespite his accumulated wealth, Mr. Ghosn\u2019s outsize compensation packages at Renault and Nissan were a matter of contention at both companies, and each had sought to rein in his pay. Mr. Ghosn received around 8 million euros, or about $9 million, from Renault in 2017 and about the same amount at Nissan.\\r\\nMr. Ghosn has denied the allegations, the Japanese public broadcaster NHK said this week. Mr. Kelly has also denied wrongdoing, according to his attorney, Yoichi Kitamura.\\r\\nMr. Kitamura told The New York Times that Mr. Kelly maintained that Mr. Ghosn had the right to set his own pay, and that the executive had decided to pay himself \u00a51 billion a year as chief executive. Mr. Ghosn and Mr. Kelly are accused of underreporting his compensation in required securities filings. Mr. Kelly said the securities report did not understate the pay, Mr. Kitamura said.\\r\\nMr. Kitamura said Mr. Kelly maintained that he had consulted with an outside lawyer about a plan to defer Mr. Ghosn\u2019s compensation. According to Japanese media, Mr. Kelly has said he asked that lawyer to get approval from Japan\u2019s Financial Services Agency to ensure the plan was correct and that it did not need to be reported as current compensation.\\r\\nMr. Kitamura said Mr. Kelly believed that the plan was legal under Japanese law after consulting with an outside lawyer.\\r\\nIn France, where Renault is the biggest automaker, Mr. Ghosn\u2019s arrest has had political ramifications, including for President Macron. The company, in which the French government holds a large share, has said it is keeping Mr. Ghosn as chief executive and appointed an interim leadership team to steady the company. Renault has described Mr. Ghosn as being \u201ctemporarily incapacitated.\u201d\\r\\nBruno Le Maire, the finance minister, has stated several times that France has \u201cno evidence\u201d of wrongdoing by Mr. Ghosn, and called on Nissan to turn over its dossier. Last week, he asked his Japanese counterpart to come to Paris to make a joint public statement on the matter.\\r\\nAt the G-20 meeting in Buenos Aires on Friday, Mr. Macron told Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan that he wanted to maintain the alliance between Renault and Nissan after Mr. Ghosn\u2019s arrest. Mr. Macron \u201creiterated his commitment to preserving the alliance as well as the stability of the group,\u201d the president\u2019s office said in a statement.\\r\\nIn the talks, Mr. Abe said that a stable Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance was important but that its future should be decided by stakeholders in the private sector rather than either government, according to a Japanese official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\\r\\nSince Mr. Ghosn pulled Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy over a decade ago, it has become the alliance\u2019s more profitable partner. In recent years, executives inside the company had raised the issue of rebalancing the relationship.\\r\\nRenault holds a 43 percent stake in Nissan, and the Japanese company holds a 15 percent stake in Renault, the same share as the French government. There have been tensions within the alliance \u2014 which accounted for 10.6 million car sales last year \u2014 as Renault has been the dominant partner.\\r\\nOn Thursday, officials from Renault and Nissan consulted in Amsterdam, where the alliance has its headquarters, and issued a statement that the board of directors of all three companies \u201cindividually and collectively emphatically reiterated their strong commitment to the alliance.\u201d The Japanese officials dialed in by teleconference.\\r\\nMr. Macron, who is facing low poll numbers and social unrest at home, can ill afford problems at Renault, which employs 47,000 people in France. Yet when he was France\u2019s economy minister in 2015, he helped inflame concerns within Nissan about Renault. Mr. Macron, a former Rothschild banker, ordered a surprise increase in the French government\u2019s stake in Renault, which was designed to double the state\u2019s voting rights.\\r\\nThe move, which Mr. Ghosn opposed in a bitter fight with Mr. Macron, rattled Nissan. Nissan has no voting rights in Renault, despite its 15 percent stake. Nissan threatened to leave the alliance\u2019s master agreement.\\r\\nSome French newspapers have questioned why and how Mr. Ghosn was being held for weeks without charges. On Thursday, the deputy head of the Tokyo prosecutor\u2019s office, Shin Kukimoto, rebuffed the criticism as na\u00efve.\\r\\n\u201cWe do not unnecessarily keep people in custody for a long time,\u201d Mr. Kukimoto said. \u201cI do not criticize other countries\u2019 systems just because they are different.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":201578773,\"description\":\"A Tokyo court gave prosecutors an extension as they investigate allegations of financial misconduct by Mr. Ghosn, the head of the Renault-Nissan alliance.\\r\",\"title\":\"Carlos Ghosn Can Remain in Tokyo Jail for 10 More Days\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"business.9.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Lisa Binderow had envisioned her labor a thousand times. She bought a birthing ball, hired a doula and even practiced hypnotherapy.\\r\\nHer plan was to deliver at the Mount Sinai West Birthing Center, an area of the hospital marked by pastel curtains, family-size beds and large birthing tubs. Separated from the regular labor and delivery floor, it is for women who want a natural childbirth with minimal medical intervention.\\r\\nYet after arriving in triage, Ms. Binderow, 35, was made to wait. And wait.\\r\\n\u201cThey kept coming back to tell me that the birthing center was closed, and they had no other rooms available,\u201d she said. As the minutes turned into hours, Ms. Binderow was forced to labor on an aluminum bed \u2014 there was not a mattress or even sheets for comfort. The only thing that separated her from other women in labor was a thin curtain. There was no chair for her husband, let alone space for her birthing ball, which was left to roll around in the hallway.\\r\\nAfter five hours, she was ready to push. \u201cThe baby was coming, and I was still in triage,\u201d she said. Eventually, a proper hospital bed arrived. Orderlies then rolled Ms. Binderow down the hall and into a room that was filled with all sorts of equipment.\\r\\n\u201cIt was a storage room,\u201d she said.\\r\\nAs Ms. Binderow was gripped by waves of intensifying contractions, staffers cleared out the space to make room for her bed. Minutes later, Siena Binderow was born there.\\r\\nIt isn\u2019t easy to have a natural, nonmedicated birth in New York. After years of hospitals trying to accommodate the option, most seem to be slowly backing away from the idea. The Mount Sinai West Birthing Center, which features just three birthing rooms, is often closed because of staffing issues or mothers who get \u201crisked out\u201d of the program for complicating factors like high blood pressure or stalled labor. And on Dec. 31, it will be shutting its doors for good.\\r\\nLast year, Ms. Binderow was one of more than 1,000 women who registered at the birthing center to have a baby there. Yet of those, only 200 mothers were actually admitted \u2014 less than 20 percent \u2014 according to Save the Birthing Center, a group of mothers, midwives and doulas petitioning to keep Mount Sinai West\u2019s center open. This year, even as news broke that the center would close, more than 990 women had signed up for it.\\r\\nThe demand for natural childbirth does not seem to be going away. In the United States, there are more than 350 free-standing (meaning that they are not located inside hospitals) birthing centers, an 82 percent increase since 2010, according to the American Association of Birth Centers. Texas has more than 70 such centers, and California has about 40. In contrast, New York State has just three: the Birthing Center of Buffalo, the Brooklyn Birthing Center and the Birthing Center of New York.\\r\\nOne reason that New York lags behind other states is that midwives here cannot operate birthing centers on their own, and are required to have a physician in charge. In November 2016, state legislation was passed to change this, but two years on, the Department of Health is still drafting the regulations necessary to implement the new law. Until then, the status quo remains.\\r\\n\u201cBirthing centers in New York have to be supervised by an M.D., and that is a huge barrier, since the majority of birthing centers in the country are staffed just by midwives,\u201d said Kate Bauer, the executive director of the American Association of Birth Centers. \u201cThe fact that it is taking so long to write the regulations is frustrating for all involved.\u201d\\r\\nA spokesman for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo wrote in an emailed statement that the governor\u2019s office expects \u201cto advance comprehensive regulations for midwifery birth centers across New York in the coming months.\u201d\\r\\nLegislation aside, the real reason, like so much else in the city, seems to point to money. Birthing centers have all the liability of traditional maternity wards, but bring in a fraction of the billable costs.\\r\\n\u201cOurs is a system that rewards doing more and penalizes letting nature take its course,\u201d said Nan Strauss, the director of policy and advocacy at the nonprofit Every Mother Counts.\\r\\nBeginning next year, after Mount Sinai closes its center, just three natural birth facilities will serve a city of more than eight million people. This includes two rooms at the NewYork-Presbyterian Lower Manhattan Hospital \u2014 the city\u2019s lone remaining in-hospital facility come 2019 \u2014 as well as three rooms at the Brooklyn Birthing Center, and four rooms at the Birthing Center of New York.\\r\\nOf course, there is always the option to give birth at home. The number of home births has increased in the last decade, and there are now about 35 home-birth midwives with practices in New York City, up from just a few in the early 1990s. Still, the numbers remain relatively low, in part because of the perceived risks associated with home births, and because they can be expensive, since almost no home-birth midwives accept in-network insurance.\\r\\nWith their options limited, many women are drawn to a whisper network of mothers, doulas, midwives and supportive obstetricians to discuss alternatives for nonmedicated births. Tactics include switching from obstetricians to midwives late in pregnancy so most of the expenses will be covered by insurance; patronizing hospitals in New Jersey, where space (and alternative staffing) does not come at such a premium; and aligning with one of the city\u2019s public hospitals that has formed an unusual partnership with a midwifery practice.\\r\\nMidwives who work at birthing centers and hospitals approach pregnancy and birth as healthy life events, using medical interventions only when necessary. But a \u201chealthy life event\u201d doesn\u2019t make a hospital money; medical procedures do. This partly explains why the national cesarean section rate is now at almost 32 percent, up from less than 21 percent back in 1996. According to one study, low-risk women who aspired to deliver naturally at a birth center \u2014 even if they resorted to an epidural or other medical assistance \u2014 had a C-section rate of just six percent.\\r\\nThe natural birth movement, a reaction to \u201ctwilight sleep\u201d injections, routine episiotomies and other interventionist hospital practices, began in New York in the 1960s and took off with the opening in 1975 of the city\u2019s first birth center, the Maternity Center Association Childbearing Center on East 92nd Street, said Dr. Laura Zeidenstein, the director of the graduate midwifery program at the Columbia School of Nursing.\\r\\nBy the early 2000s, things had changed. In 2003, the Elizabeth Seton Childbearing Center in Greenwich Village, the successor to the Maternity Center, closed. That same year, NewYork-Presbyterian\u2019s Allen Hospital eliminated most of its midwifery services, and then later, the Morris Heights Childbearing Center also closed. In 2009, Bellevue closed its birthing center.\\r\\n\u201cI would say we are in a really big crisis right now, but I\u2019m hopeful that it is a crisis of opportunity,\u201d said Dr. Zeidenstein, who worked at the Maternity Center and helped found Elizabeth Seton. \u201cThings that have long been true \u2014 racial disparities, high maternal and infant mortality rates, the disrespectful treatment of women in obstetrics \u2014 are finally coming to the forefront of public awareness and hopefully action will be next.\u201d\\r\\nWhen it closes later this month, the Mount Sinai West Birthing Center will be replaced with 13 neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) beds and 15 private postpartum rooms. \u201cWe are making critically necessary expansions of our NICU and postpartum rooms to address the growing volume of sick and premature babies,\u201d the hospital said in a statement. \u201cThe decision to convert the birth center into NICU and postpartum unit was in no way driven by financial considerations, any suggestion otherwise is false.\u201d\\r\\nYet many experts insist the closure is financially motivated. Because of the way that insurance companies reimburse hospitals, the more procedures, the more revenue generated. For instance, in 2010, private insurers reimbursed hospitals, on average, almost $10,000 more for a C-section birth than for a vaginal birth, according to a study by Truven Health Analytics.\\r\\nBy closing the birthing center, Mount Sinai will be more than doubling its private postpartum rooms, for which it currently charges $900 a night, a fee that is not covered by insurance. Its new neonatal intensive care unit, while undoubtedly critical for many babies, will most likely be a major profit center for the hospital.\\r\\n\u201cIt is such a clear indication that this is the continued growth of the medical-industrial complex,\u201d said Dana-Ain Davis, the director of the Center for the Study of Women and Society at the City University of New York, of the birthing center\u2019s closure. By increasing the neonatal intensive care beds, Ms. Davis added, the focus is \u201cintervention, rather than prevention.\u201d\\r\\nRecent news that NewYork-Presbyterian will be investing in a new, state-of-the-art maternity facility \u2014 without a designated birthing center \u2014 has only intensified competition among hospitals. When it opens in 2020, the Alexandra Cohen Hospital for Women and Newborns will have 75 private postpartum rooms, up from just 22 private rooms currently, as well as 60 neonatal intensive care beds, and 16 labor and delivery rooms. The hospital also claims it will have New York City\u2019s only operating room situated within a neonatal intensive care unit.\\r\\n\u201cI really do feel strongly that women \u2014 all women \u2014 have different ideas of what they want for their birth experience, and it is our job to give that to them, whatever that is,\u201d said Dr. Laura Riley, who was recently hired to run the new hospital.\\r\\n\u201cWith this new hospital, the competition is going to be all about how much hospitals can make themselves like hotels,\u201d said Bonu deCaires, a longtime doula and educator. \u201cAre there private rooms? What is the food like? How plush is it? But what really matters is the care that you receive, not the thread count.\u201d\\r\\nWhile competition is tough among hospitals, it has become dire for midwives. In recent years, a combination of high malpractice insurance costs and low reimbursement rates has forced several midwifery practices to close.\\r\\n\u201cMidwifery is very hands-on and time-intensive,\u201d said Dr. Zeidenstein of Columbia, who was also a midwife at Midwifery of Manhattan, a private practice that, despite having a patient waiting list, closed last year. \u201cMidwives utilize technology judiciously. The cost is human time and that just can\u2019t be billed for.\u201d\\r\\nDoulas, or birthing coaches, are also struggling to make ends meet. But their services aren\u2019t covered by insurance, limiting the number of women who can hire them. The New York State Department of Health, in looking to remedy this, is considering measures for Medicaid to cover doulas, although the proposal is not yet finalized.\\r\\n\u201cIt is about birth justice and body autonomy,\u201d said Chanel L. Porchia-Albert, the founder of Ancient Song Doula Services, which provides free and low-cost care. \u201cWhat happens sometimes for women of color is that we are criminalized for the choices we make,\u201d she said. \u201cIf a woman comes in and says I don\u2019t want this medical intervention, they will call child protective services because they consider it medical neglect, or if you don\u2019t want to have a C-section and want a natural birth, they will ignore your wishes or even refuse basic medical care.\u201d\\r\\nIt was these concerns that drove Marsha Willock, a nurse from Canarsie, Brooklyn, who is black, to hire a doula. \u201cI really want to survive this, and the maternity mortality rate really shook me up,\u201d said Ms. Willock, who was referring to the fact that in New York City, non-Hispanic black woman are 12 times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than non-Hispanic white women. \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t be dying,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially for something that is supposed to be natural.\u201d\\r\\nAt Lower Manhattan Hospital, the situation is similar to that of Mount Sinai West. Rooms are often inaccessible or closed, and disgruntled midwives have quit. Ms. deCaires, for instance, recently attended a birth with a mother who was told when she arrived that the birthing center was full; the mother would have to give birth in a regular labor and delivery room. Yet when she settled into her room, it turned out to be a birthing center room, with with a tub and other accoutrements. The mother was prohibited from making use of these things; she ended up with an epidural.\\r\\n\u201cThe Birth Center at NewYork-Presbyterian Lower Manhattan Hospital has two fully operational rooms,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cOne of the Birth Center rooms can also accommodate all labor and delivery patients.\u201d\\r\\nJennifer Adair decided to leave the city to have her baby. \u201cI loved my obstetrician, but as I got into my third trimester, there was a lot more talk about medical interventions,\u201d said Ms. Adair, an assistant professor at Fairfield University who lives in Inwood. At 31 weeks, she switched to a midwife, but since she was so far along, her options were limited. A doula suggested that she consider giving birth in New Jersey.\\r\\n\u201cI found the level of care there was exactly what I wanted,\u201d said Ms. Adair, who delivered at Pascack Valley Medical Center in Westwood, a short drive over the George Washington Bridge. The hospital doesn\u2019t have a separate birthing center, but it does offer midwifery care, and Ms. Adair gave birth without medical interventions. \u201cMy insurance was accepted, and unlike the hospitals I saw in New York, you were guaranteed a private postpartum room at no extra charge.\u201d\\r\\nFor those who would like to stay in the city, there is, perhaps, a new option. Two years ago, Jamee Gidwitz planned to give birth at Mount Sinai East on Fifth Avenue. But after touring the hospital, she said, she grew fearful that the staff there wouldn\u2019t support her choices. When she told her doctors at Village Obstetrics, who are affiliated with Mount Sinai East, they suggested that she be the first of their patients to try a new model of care they were offering.\\r\\nThe doctors, George Mussalli and Jaqueline Worth, were opening Village Maternity, a private midwifery practice. It was to be a separate business from Village Obstetrics. Dr. Mussalli and Dr. Worth would continue delivering babies at Mount Sinai East, but Village Maternity midwives would deliver babies at Metropolitan Hospital, a public hospital in East Harlem.\\r\\nLocated on First Avenue and 97th Street, Metropolitan is a part of New York City\u2019s Health and Hospitals Corporation. The majority of its patients are part of its pre- and postnatal clinic, which serves mostly lower- and middle-income women with either no insurance or public insurance.\\r\\nThere are several reasons Dr. Mussalli and Dr. Worth chose Metropolitan. The hospital has midwives on staff, and Dr. Mussalli did his residency there. Moreover, unlike most private hospitals in New York, Metropolitan offers private postpartum rooms at no extra cost.\\r\\n\u201cAs private hospitals have gotten busier, the city\u2019s hospital system hasn\u2019t enjoyed the same increase in their volume,\u201d Dr. Mussalli said. \u201cIt is a leftover reputation from the 1970s, when people wanted to avoid city hospitals. But I know firsthand that the city system has changed.\u201d\\r\\nMs. Gidwitz, a publicist who lives in the financial district, toured Metropolitan. She was impressed. \u201cThere were huge private labor and delivery rooms,\u201d she said, \u201cpostpartum rooms with en-suite bathrooms, your toddlers could come in \u2014 my partner slept in the same bed with me. I have no idea why it wasn\u2019t filled to capacity.\u201d\\r\\nBack at Mount Sinai West, the 90-member Save the Birthing Center group is holding out hope that the hospital will reverse course. It has been meeting regularly, and its petition has so far garnered more than 14,000 signatures.\\r\\nLauren Alzamora, a member of the group, has seen the benefits of her advocacy firsthand. The former dancer wrote a letter asking for confirmation from the hospital that she would not be turned away from the center when she went into labor. The letter was co-signed by more than a dozen women who are also set to deliver at the center before it closes.\\r\\nMount Sinai refused to give Ms. Alzamora any such assurances. But when she arrived, the nurses, who knew of her activism, ushered her through triage and directly to the birthing center. Her daughter Kascher was born there without medical intervention. \u201cIt was a beautiful birth,\u201d Ms. Alzamora said. \u201cA natural birth should be every woman\u2019s right.

In Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s absence, officials spent more than three hours grilling a Facebook executive who stood in for him, criticizing the company\u2019s influence on democracy, its distribution of false news and its use of personal user data.\\r\\n\u201cYou have lost the trust of the international community,\u201d said Charlie Angus, an official representing Canada.

The documents were originally uncovered during a California lawsuit over data sharing between Facebook and the maker of an app called Six4Three, and are under seal in the United States.\\r\\nBut Mr. Collins did not release the documents on Tuesday, saying he needed more time to go through them.\\r\\nThat left most of the hearing\u2019s spotlight on Richard Allan, Facebook\u2019s vice president for policy solutions, who attended the session in place of Mr. Zuckerberg and who sat next to the empty seat left for his boss.\\r\\nMr. Allan, also a member of the British House of Lords, said Facebook accepted a need for new regulation, without specifying which policies it would support.\\r\\n\u201cWe have damaged public trust through some of the actions we\u2019ve taken,\u201d said Mr. Allan, who later repeated variations of the same apology.\\r\\nHe added, \u201cThere were things that we missed that we were either not sufficiently focused on or too slow to react to.\u201d\\r\\nBut policymakers at the hearing were less than satisfied.

The issue is sensitive since Russia  used Facebook to manipulate American voters during the 2016 presidential election.\\r\\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Facebook said that \u201cthe engineer who had flagged those initial concerns subsequently looked into this further and found no evidence of specific Russian activity.\u201d Facebook also released the emails.\\r\\nOther policymakers, alluding to other internal Facebook documents, asked whether the company had ever restricted app developers\u2019 access to user data unless the developer had purchased mobile advertising.

Hall, a trader and a prolific art collector, $465,000.\\r\\nThe lawyer for the Gascards, William B. Pribis, had no comment and said no decision had been made about an appeal. But the finding seemed to end a saga that began when Mr. Hall, who had amassed a fortune with canny trades in oil markets, started building a personal art collection, including many works by Golub, an American postwar painter whose art explored dire political conditions with expressionistic, heroic-scale figures. Mr. Hall believed Golub\u2019s work was undervalued and due to appreciate.\\r\\n[Read more about the case.]\\r\\nFrom 2009 to 2011, Mr. Hall bought 24 paintings from the Gascards, including several at Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s auction houses in New York, one on an online auction site, and 16 directly from the Gascards after Nikolas Gascard reached out and made contact with Mr. Hall.\\r\\nBut Mr. Hall became suspicious in 2015 when he set out to stage an exhibition of Golub\u2019s art at the private rural museum he established near his home in Reading, Vt.\\r\\nA foundation established to promote work by Golub and his wife, the artist Nancy Spero, examined the paintings and found problems, including no record of the Gascard Golubs in the foundation\u2019s database and \u201ca number of unusual formal characteristics during in-person examinations of the paintings,\u201d according to court papers.\\r\\nThe Gascards denied the paintings were fakes. Ms. Gascard said that she had gotten to know Golub while attending his classes at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Teaneck, N.J., in the late 1970s, and that they had become close friends until his death in 2004.\\r\\nShe and her son told the court that Golub had given her some works and that members of her family who lived in Germany had separately collected Golubs, which the Gascards found and retrieved following their relatives\u2019 deaths. Mr. Gascard did admit to making up titles and dates for some of the paintings, saying in a deposition that he had arrived at the dates based \u201con my research and the style of painting,\u201d according to The Keene Sentinel.\\r\\nMr. Hall\u2019s lawyer, Ted Poretz, called to the stand a Golub expert, Jon Bird, a professor emeritus at Middlesex University in London, who testified that the works Mr. Hall was sold demonstrated clear differences with Golub\u2019s style.\\r\\nShowing some of the works to the jurors, Professor Bird said that the dates of the works did not match Golub\u2019s style at that time and that they did not appear to have been made with Golub\u2019s familiar scraping technique. Instead, the paint had been layered on, Mr. Poretz said.\\r\\nProfessor Bird also said the depiction of human forms did not share the same nuance that Golub was known for, Mr. Poretz said.\\r\\nAt Franklin Pierce, Ms. Gascard taught undergraduate art history and drawing and supervised the college art gallery. An artist herself, practicing a technique called rust art, she often walked around campus wearing white gloves and dark glasses, faculty colleagues said. She left Franklin Pierce in 2015 after an unrelated dispute with the administration.\\r\\nMs. Gascard said that she did not paint, but a former neighbor came forward at the last minute, testifying at the trial that she had often smelled paint and had seen painting tools and unfinished paintings in the basement she shared with Ms. Gascard, Mr. Hall said.\\r\\nIn an interview, Mr. Hall said that even though some people wondered why he had wanted to draw attention to the fact that he had been tricked, he said he was glad he had pursued the case and now felt vindicated. \u201cPeople thought maybe I was rash and should put it down to one of life\u2019s rich experiences,\u201d he said. \u201cBut people defrauding other people, especially in the art market, should not be allowed to get away with it.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Hall said that though he was satisfied because he was getting his money back, \u201cI am even happier for Leon Golub and his legacy that was being impaired by this whole business.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cI hope it\u2019s cleared the air,\u201d he said.\\r\\nMr. Hall earned his fortune making large bets in commodities markets.

But even before their arrival, there was a severe bottleneck in asylum processing at the crossing, with some 3,000 people cramming the city\u2019s migrant shelters and cheap hotels waiting for their turn to apply.\\r\\nThis long-running crush at the border gave rise to The List.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat Is The List?\\r\\nFor the migrants seeking to apply for asylum in the United States at the San Ysidro border crossing, the first step is to get their names on The List, an informal numbering system that puts them in a virtual line for their appointment with the American immigration authorities.\\r\\nIt is a critical part of the American asylum application process, yet, strangely, its operation has nothing to do with the United States government. It is an entirely Mexican construct that begins and ends on the Mexican side of the border.\\r\\nThat said, it\u2019s a direct result of American migration policy. For years, most migrants seeking asylum in the United States needed only to show up at a port of entry to begin the asylum process, and there was usually no delay.\\r\\nBut the Trump administration has used a system known as \u201cmetering,\u201d which limits the number of asylum-seekers allowed to present their cases to the United States each day at certain ports of entry. The system was instituted by the Obama administration in 2016 to respond to the thousands of Haitian migrants who had ended up in Tijuana and the nearby city of Mexicali seeking to cross into the United States.\\r\\nAt the incredibly busy crossing in Tijuana, known as El Chaparral, the metering system caused severe backups and disorder.\\r\\nSo The List was born.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho Runs It?\\r\\nThis is where things get even more unusual.\\r\\nThe List is not operated by the Mexican government, at least not officially. It is maintained by the asylum-seekers themselves \u2014 an extraordinary effort to impose order on what for many migrants is a bewildering and opaque bureaucratic system.\\r\\nA continually rotating cast of migrants has assumed control of the process. As the managers have moved further up the very list they coordinate, eventually having their own day of reckoning with the American immigration authorities, other asylum-seekers have been selected to replace them.\\r\\nThe List is currently under the management of a group of eight migrants from four countries: Mexico, Honduras, Peru and Nicaragua. They were voted in by other migrants, they said, to replace another team that had been accused of taking bribes in return for advancing people on the list.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow Does a Migrant Get on The List? \\r\\nThe List is defined by a series of rituals, which unfold shortly after daybreak every day on the plaza outside the border crossings at El Chaparral.\\r\\nMigrants seeking to apply for American asylum line up to put their names on a register, a hard-bound ledger maintained by the managers of The List. In return each receives a number, handwritten on a scrap of paper, and is told to return in several weeks and start checking to see if that number is coming up. In the meantime, they remain in Tijuana, fending off boredom.\\r\\n\u201cAs long as I\u2019m not in Honduras, there\u2019s no problem,\u201d said Marlon Cerrato, 30, who put his name on The List one morning this week. He said he had fled political repression in Honduras, his home country. \u201cI feel very relaxed waiting,\u201d he said.\\r\\nMore than 5,000 people are on The List now, which translates into waits of two months or more. Since January, more than 11,600 people have put their names on The List.\\r\\nMexican migration officials assert that they have nothing to do with The List, that it\u2019s a system managed by and for the migrants. Yet, officers from Mexico\u2019s National Migration Institute are present as the process unfolds. At the end of the day, the volunteers hand over the ledgers to the officers for safekeeping.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow Do Asylum-Seekers Progress?\\r\\nAmerican border officials tell their Mexican counterparts how many people will be interviewed on a given day \u2014 in recent weeks, the daily capacity has ranged from about 40 to 100 \u2014 and the Mexican officials inform the volunteers managing The List.\\r\\nAround 8 a.m., the volunteers organize the group of migrants who will be applying for asylum that day.\\r\\nAs expectant migrants gather on the plaza, many carrying packed bags or pulling roller suitcases, a volunteer reads out the numbers and names of the people who will be able to make their cases in the United States that day.\\r\\nThose whose numbers are called are put on a minibus and driven by Mexican migration officials to a crossing into the United States. On a recent morning, the migrants were from countries including Mexico, Haiti, Cameroon, Russia, Honduras and El Salvador.\\r\\nIf someone is not present when his name is called, he is given 24 hours to resurface.

A deficiency of vitamin B12 can cause neurological and psychiatric problems that \u201ccan progress if left untreated, and can lead to irreversible damage,\u201d said Dr. Donald Hensrud, director of the Mayo Clinic\u2019s Healthy Living Program. Fortunately, it can be reversed fairly easily with vitamin pills or injections.\\r\\nVitamin B12 is required for proper red blood cell formation, nerve function and DNA synthesis. It is naturally present in fish, meat, eggs and dairy products, as well as some fortified breakfast cereals and nutritional yeast products.\\r\\nStrict vegans who avoid animal products can develop a deficiency of B12 over time if they don\u2019t take a supplement. But two-thirds of cases occur in the elderly, who are susceptible because they may not absorb adequate amounts of B12 from foods but who are not routinely tested, Dr. Hensrud said.\\r\\nConsequences of B12 deficiency can cause a range of symptoms that include fatigue, weakness, constipation, loss of appetite and weight loss. Other symptoms include difficulty maintaining balance, depression, confusion, dementia, poor memory and soreness in the mouth or tongue.\\r\\nB12 deficiency may also result in a form of anemia called megaloblastic anemia, which can also result from a deficiency of folic acid, another B vitamin. If anemia is detected on blood tests, levels of both vitamins should be checked.\\r\\nNeurological symptoms can, however, occur in the absence of anemia. Early treatment is critical to avoid potentially irreversible damage.\\r\\nOlder adults are susceptible to B12 deficiency because they may have decreased secretion of hydrochloric acid in the stomach, which makes it difficult to absorb B12. \\r\\nAlso vulnerable to B12 deficiency are those with gastrointestinal disorders like celiac disease or Crohn\u2019s disease; those who have had weight loss or other gastrointestinal surgery; and those who use certain acid reflux drugs or the diabetes drug metformin. Individuals with pernicious anemia, which affects up to 2 percent of older adults, are also susceptible.\\r\\nDo you have a health question?

Mr. Duma said that made the 11th-hour effort from the Western powers \u201ca bit patronizing.\u201d\\r\\nThe competing offer comes as concerns have grown in Australia and allied nations about China\u2019s investments in the resource-rich island countries of the Pacific Ocean. This year, Australia agreed to fund an undersea communications cable linking Sydney with the Solomon Islands, following a similar deal with Papua New Guinea.\\r\\nAustralian officials were worried that if the project went to Huawei, as the Solomon Islands had agreed in 2016, the Chinese company might gain access to Australia\u2019s internet infrastructure. In 2012, Huawei was barred out of security concerns from bidding on projects for Australia\u2019s national broadband network. The company has, however, sold equipment to Australian cellular operators.\\r\\nLike Australia, New Zealand has been grappling with a series of scandals related to Chinese influence. Last month, a New Zealand lawmaker was accused of trying to hide a campaign contribution from a businessman with ties to the Chinese Communist Party. Another lawmaker was revealed last year to have been a member of the Communist Party in China who taught English to spies there.\\r\\nMore recently, agents of Beijing were blamed for a burglary targeting a New Zealand professor who studies the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s influence in Western countries.\\r\\nDespite those concerns, New Zealand has been relatively tactful in dealing with China, experts say. As a result, its two-way trade with China has more than tripled in the past decade, according to government statistics, and the bilateral relationship has become one of New Zealand\u2019s most important.\\r\\nLast year, New Zealand became the first advanced economy to join China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, an ambitious infrastructure program stretching through much of Asia that is widely seen as an effort to extend Beijing\u2019s political influence.\\r\\nPapua New Guinea is also a signatory to the Belt and Road Initiative, which has drawn it closer to China. That has not stopped officials there from raising questions about potential ties between Huawei and the Chinese government, according to a report on Tuesday by Danielle Cave, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.\\r\\nBut in a region in desperate need of infrastructure, officials may take funding where they can get it, said Mr. Duma, the Papua New Guinea minister.\\r\\nSecurity concerns are \u201cfor the big boys to worry about,\u201d he said.\\r\\nThe joint offer that Papua New Guinea rejected on Tuesday came too late, said Jonathan Pryke, director of the Pacific islands program at the Lowy Institute in Sydney. Still, he said, it was meant to show that the United States and its allies remain a viable alternative to China\u2019s money and influence.\\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to show that we\u2019re still in this game,\u201d Mr. Pryke said, referring to the position of the three allies. \u201cWe wanted to maintain our position as a partner of choice.\u201d\\r\\nOfficials from Pacific island countries have also complained about the West\u2019s paternalistic approach in providing aid packages. Still, the United States and its allies are trying to adapt.\\r\\nThis month, Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Japan said they would help Papua New Guinea significantly expand its electrical grid. Ms. Cave said in an interview that it was an \u201cambitious and very good example of listening and responding.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1464142267,\"description\":\"The announcement came a day after Papua New Guinea said it would uphold a deal with Huawei, illustrating the growing global divide over the risks of Chinese technology.\\r\",\"title\":\"New Zealand Blocks Huawei, in Blow to Chinese Telecom Giant\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"technology.17.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"JERUSALEM \u2014 For as long as she has anchored her own television news program \u2014 about five years, in different iterations \u2014 Lucy Aharish has always opened by greeting her viewers in both Hebrew and Arabic.\\r\\nIt\u2019s only natural: She is Israeli \u2014 born and raised in Dimona \u2014 and Arab and Muslim, the daughter of parents who moved to the south from Nazareth. Her frequent monologues are a trademark and have sometimes resonated far afield: Impassioned diatribes about the failure of both the West and Arab leaders to protect innocent victims of the Syrian civil war were seen by millions of viewers worldwide.\\r\\nYet, because so few Arabs and Muslims have prominent roles in Hebrew-language news in Israel, and because racism is so commonplace in Israeli society, Ms. Aharish says, she continues to receive a steady supply of hate mail merely for adding \u201cmasa\u2019a al-kheir\u201d to the \u201cerev tov\u201d she wishes her audience at the top of each weeknight show.\\r\\nShe ignores most complaints, but one letter a month ago stirred her interest. The anonymous writer called her Arabic salutations \u201cinappropriate and very jarring,\u201d and said it was \u201cimproper\u201d for the station to allow them. Yet the writer sounded respectful, and closed with an old-fashioned Hebrew expression: \u201cAlu v\u2019hatzlichu,\u201d or \u201cGo forth and succeed.\u201d\\r\\nMs. Aharish posted the missive online and drew comments praising her support for coexistence and religious tolerance, most of them from Israeli Jews \u2014 including some who took note of the letter writer\u2019s polished Hebrew phraseology.\\r\\nOn Monday, however, the same anonymous viewer renewed his complaint in a more belligerent tone. If Ms. Aharish needed the \u201crelief\u201d of speaking Arabic, he wrote in an email, \u201clet her go to the bathroom, give a speech in Arabic to the toilet bowl and come back and talk to us only in Hebrew.\u201d If it was so important to her, he said, \u201clet her go to Al-Jazeera.\u201d\\r\\nMs. Aharish shared this screed online, too. But that was not enough for her.\\r\\nShe had been struck by the musicality of the first, more respectful letter, she said. So she asked her husband \u2014 Tsahi Halevi, a well-known Israeli actor and singer-songwriter \u2014 to help her set it to music.\\r\\nOn Wednesday night, Mr. Halevi brought a guitar to the set of \u201cSichat Hayom\u201d (\u201cToday\u2019s Conversation\u201d), his wife\u2019s half-hour show on Israel\u2019s Channel 13. Just before the credits rolled, he sang the letter in a plaintive, minor-key tune, with Ms. Aharish chiming in on the refrain: \u201cmasa\u2019a al-kheir,\u201d the offending hello.\\r\\nIt was a witty rejoinder to an unseen umbrage-taker. The clip spread rapidly on social media in Israel.\\r\\nThe duet was both a striking tableau and a tentative stepping out for a husband and wife who had earned fame in the Israeli art and media worlds very much on their own, only to be attacked when their marriage became public.\\r\\nMs. Aharish, 37, and Mr. Halevi, 43, a star of the Netflix hit series \u201cFauda,\u201d who is Jewish, had kept their relationship secret even from some members of their families before they married on Oct. 10 in a private interfaith ceremony.\\r\\nNo sooner had their wedding been reported than the interior minister, Aryeh Deri, condemned their union as an example of assimilation that he said was \u201cconsuming the Jewish people,\u201d and urged Ms. Aharish to convert, lest their children face \u201cserious problems.\u201d\\r\\nA right-wing lawmaker known for rabble-rousing, Oren Hazan, accused Mr. Halevi of becoming \u201cIslamicized\u201d and suggested he had gotten carried away with his role in \u201cFauda\u201d as an Israeli counterterrorism agent who goes undercover as an Arab.\\r\\nIt wasn\u2019t just from politicians that they encountered criticism, Ms. Aharish said. A woman on a motorcycle accosted her husband on the street in Tel Aviv, warning him that \u201c \u2018What you\u2019re doing is a big mistake, and we need to talk about it,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that people feel they can be involved in the decisions you make in your private life.\u201d\\r\\nBut Ms. Aharish and Mr. Halevi got support in some quarters, even from other politicians, and many Jewish TV colleagues went on the air and wished them \u201cmabrouk\u201d and \u201cmazal tov.\u201d\\r\\nJewish-Muslim marriages are relatively uncommon in Israel, although Arab citizens make up some 21 percent of the population, and those Muslim-Jewish couples who do tie the knot rarely garner much attention. But the Aharish-Halevi union may have been the first such high-profile, celebrity wedding.\\r\\nLehava, a far-right Jewish extremist group, has long campaigned against assimilation; some of its leaders were detained for questioning last year, suspected of intimidation for allegedly threatening Arab men who were dating young Jewish women.\\r\\nIsrael is replete with opinionated people, of course; and Ms. Aharish is no exception. On her return to the anchor\u2019s chair in October after her wedding, Ms. Aharish delivered a broadside against politicians who had bothered to pontificate about her marriage when serious social and security problems \u2014 women being murdered, sick children waiting for their medications, the \u201cburning south\u201d near the Gaza border \u2014 were languishing unsolved.\\r\\nMr. Halevi, for his part, suggested that Mr. Hazan instead \u201coccupy himself with love.\u201d\\r\\nOn Wednesday, the newlyweds concluded their song with a mock marital spat poking fun at the sensibilities of anyone irked by the sound of Arabic, or by the idea of Mr. Halevi and Ms. Aharish living happily ever after.\\r\\nMr. Halevi grumbled that he was going \u201ccrazy\u201d with \u201cthat masa\u2019a al-kheir\u201d and stalked off the set.\\r\\n\u201cDarling,\u201d Ms. Aharish called after him, as if she would be following him home shortly and would need a shower at the end of her shift, \u201cturn on the hot water, will you?\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-158803391,\"description\":\"Lucy Aharish, a TV anchor, and her husband, Tsahi Halevi, an actor, deflect condemnation from politicians and angry strangers with humor and song.\\r\",\"title\":\"Hate Mail and Conversion Advice: Interfaith Couple Caught in Israel\u2019s Fault Lines\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"world.8.txt\"}],\"labelMap\":[[61447848,\"technology\"],[-2095820065,\"science\"],[1019667238,\"science\"],[1931849565,\"world\"],[1078252366,\"business\"],[400461459,\"business\"],[-1869905367,\"science\"],[-580549357,\"business\"],[-592673859,\"business\"],[1700442999,\"world\"],[-528635622,\"business\"],[621865068,\"business\"],[659434478,\"business\"],[1868053907,\"science\"],[-2031516889,\"technology\"],[-1233719476,\"business\"],[1131488870,\"health\"],[472079094,\"business\"],[275771711,\"business\"],[-1872930463,\"health\"],[2048410531,\"world\"],[-589719920,\"health\"],[-858981003,\"technology\"],[879478674,\"world\"],[2013679192,\"business\"],[1866762071,\"business\"],[-234078885,\"health\"],[-1578760496,\"business\"],[1290383668,\"world\"],[-1435074447,\"business\"],[-691696041,\"business\"],[-1729538882,\"business\"],[-223316604,\"world\"],[298995085,\"world\"],[1112125808,\"business\"],[771271037,\"health\"],[-78975018,\"business\"],[201578773,\"world\"],[39893877,\"world\"],[-51772054,\"health\"],[-2112452557,\"world\"],[-864051157,\"business\"],[625140182,\"business\"],[-1464142267,\"science\"],[-158803391,\"world\"]],\"confusionMatrix\":[[5,2,0,0,2],[6,0,1,0,2],[2,1,1,2,3],[4,1,1,1,2],[3,2,2,0,2]],\"confusionLabels\":[\"business\",\"health\",\"science\",\"technology\",\"world\"],\"relabelingLabelMap\":[],\"accuracy\":0.2,\"correctRelabeled\":[],\"labelingPrecision\":null,\"labelingRecall\":0,\"correctAssignedItems\":[],\"assignmentPrecision\":null,\"openedItems\":[],\"numOpenedItems\":0,\"selectedItems\":[2013679192,-1233719476,472079094,621865068,1019667238,-287299375,1661884965,-1402549333,2146958515,-1181703224,252720659],\"selectedInCategory\":4,\"selectionRecall\":0.36363636363636365},{\"modelOperation\":\"add\",\"changedFiles\":[{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Ryan Smith spent years planning to sell shares of his software company, Qualtrics, on the stock market, meeting with bankers, carefully auditing financials and shaping a Wall Street-friendly narrative about the company\u2019s prospects. Two weeks ago, the finish line was close, with a listing on the Nasdaq just a few days away.\\r\\nBut shortly before a staff meeting to update Qualtrics\u2019 employees about the public listing, Mr. Smith received a phone call from Bill McDermott, chief executive of SAP. \u201cIt\u2019s on,\u201d Mr. McDermott told Mr. Smith.\\r\\nMr. Smith then stunned Qualtrics\u2019 workers with a totally different message: SAP had agreed to buy the company for $8 billion in cash, nearly double the valuation bankers had set for the company\u2019s public listing. It was a decision, Mr. Smith said in an interview, that he did not second-guess one bit.\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019ve never felt more peace in my life,\u201d he said.\\r\\nThat kind of last-minute deal, an increasingly common occurrence in the tech industry, is contributing to a major reshaping of the American financial landscape that has been underway for years.\\r\\nSmall and midsize companies are fading from stock markets, leaving far fewer publicly traded companies. Many of the smaller companies are bought by larger organizations or are enticed to stay private by the sharp rise in venture capital money, both of which allow them to avoid the volatility and scrutiny that come with going public. The number of listed companies peaked in the late 1990s, before the dot-com bust, plummeting 52 percent by 2016.\\r\\nThe shift leaves big companies with an outsize influence. That effect was  on display last week, as tech giants like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, whose sky-high profits had powered leading indexes on their long march up, led a retreat of major stock indexes.\\r\\nSome economists say the buyouts of early-stage companies by large dominant players help explain why, by many measures, the American economy has been less dynamic in recent years. Less competition can contribute to sluggish rates of entrepreneurship, business creation, wage growth and productivity, they say.\\r\\nTechnology companies are still going public. But Qualtrics\u2019 last-minute deal mirrored similar moves by other software companies. This year Adaptive Insights, a financial planning software company, sold to Workday two days before it was scheduled to go public. Last year, AppDynamics, a software analytics company, sold to Cisco the night before its I.P.O.\\r\\nEven some companies that do go public can find that their time there is short-lived. In March, Salesforce acquired Mulesoft, a software integration company, just a year after its public offering.\\r\\n\u201cCompanies like Qualtrics are saying, \u2018Huh, why bother the fighting in the public markets if I can do just as well by presenting myself for acquisition in sort of a premarket sale?\u2019\u201d said Andrew Karolyi, a Cornell University finance professor who has studied the decline of publicly traded companies.\\r\\nThe traditionally vibrant American small business sector was long viewed as a strength for the economy. Small businesses are more likely to develop innovative new technologies, forcing large companies to reinvest significant amounts of profits to keep pace. The economy benefits from that competition, improving productivity and generating new and higher-quality products and services for consumers.\\r\\nBut there is evidence that the competitive climate has changed. Across industries \u2014 from retailing to manufacturing to construction \u2014 start-up businesses are playing a smaller role as new companies are slower to form and employ a smaller share of America\u2019s workers.\\r\\nAt the same time, the market share of the largest companies in many industries has risen. Merger and acquisition activity is much higher than it used to be. And companies are spending less of their profits on investment than they used to.\\r\\nThe ability of large, cash-rich companies to buy smaller businesses before they have the chance to emerge as formidable competitors has altered the corporate landscape, said Thomas Philippon, a professor of economics at New York University, who has studied the increased dominance of large companies in many American industries.\\r\\n\u201cWhat would have happened to Instagram if Facebook hadn\u2019t had bought them?\u201d Mr. Philippon said. \u201cThey would have competed with Facebook for sure.\u201d\\r\\nThe technology sector has been a big part of the shift away from the public markets, including in the area of cloud computing, one of the fastest-growing corners of the industry. The abundance of private sources of capital \u2014 driven by outsize \u201cmega-rounds\u201d of funding \u2014 means start-ups can stay private longer.\\r\\nFrom 2001 to 2017, the median age of a venture-backed start-up going public was 11 years, according to a study by Jay R. Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida. That\u2019s three years older than in the 1980s and 1990s, excluding the dot-com boom.\\r\\nBig tech companies like SAP and Cisco are attracted to the reliable revenue streams of the new class of cloud-based software providers, which charge monthly subscription fees for their offerings.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s a game-changer for some of these big companies that need to adapt to a new way of doing business,\u201d said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital, a provider of I.P.O.-related research and services.\\r\\nMeanwhile, the start-ups that are bought just before a public offering get a powerful overnight lift to their planned valuations, a strong assurance in the face of a shaky stock market.\\r\\n\u201cThe public markets would not have awarded these companies those kinds of multiples,\u201d Ms. Smith said.\\r\\nWhile Qualtrics is growing quickly, its $290 million in annual revenue will not make an immediate difference in the earnings of SAP, which brought in more than $20 billion in 2017. But Mr. Smith of Qualtrics said that joining with SAP would help him accomplish in two years what would have taken five.\\r\\n\u201cOur only reason to go public was not for the financial side. It was to go take this to the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got that in one swoop.\u201d\\r\\nTraditional investors in early-stage companies that used to go public have had to adjust to the new reality. For instance, the asset manager and mutual fund company T. Rowe Price, based in Baltimore, has increased its investing activity in pre-I.P.O. companies, including Airbnb and Uber, as well as Snap, the social media company, before it went public in 2017.\\r\\n\u201cWe are seeing opportunities to invest in companies with very similar characteristics to what would have been early-stage public market companies decades ago \u2014 only these companies are oftentimes raising money through private markets instead,\u201d Corey Shull, an analyst who leads early-stage internet investments at T. Rowe Price, wrote in an email.\\r\\nInvesting in hot private start-ups is not generally available to the public. Retail investors seeking to ride the wave of hot cloud companies, for example, have had numerous opportunities to jump on an enterprise tech public offering this year. But some of the most notable ones, including Qualtrics, Adaptive Insights and Mulesoft, are now under the umbrella of much larger conglomerates.\\r\\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t have to tap the public markets to raise money, then why would you?\u201d said Barrett Daniels, a partner at Deloitte who focuses on I.P.O. advisory work.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1873518404,\"description\":\"Small and midsize firms are increasingly steering clear of going public, giving big companies outsize influence over stock markets and hampering business creation, wage growth and productivity.\\r\",\"title\":\"More Small Companies Avoid I.P.O.s, Sapping U.S. Economy\u2019s Vitality\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"technology.20.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"On the morning of Nov. 9, a wildfire busted out of a small area outside Los Angeles, jumped Highway 101 and ignited the jagged hills of the Santa Monica Mountains. In its fiery path were thousands of homes and residents, and a mountain lion named P-74.\\r\\nIt was the last day P-74 was seen alive. While the wildfire, known as the Woolsey Fire, raged through the slopes and canyons over the next two weeks, scorching over 1,500 buildings and killing three people, park rangers in the Santa Monica Mountains searched for GPS signals from about a dozen mountain lions constantly tracked there. All of them were eventually located alive except for P-74, a roughly one-year-old male and the newest member of the group.\\r\\nOn Monday, rangers in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, a vast area of trails and parks on federal land overlooking the Pacific Ocean, confirmed what they had feared was true: P-74 likely died in the blaze. His GPS collar last sent a signal at 1 p.m. on Nov. 9, but failed to register at the next automatic check-in, at 5 p.m. that same day.\\r\\n\u201cWe never got another point after that,\u201d Seth Riley, the wildlife branch chief at the recreation area, said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cThe fire came through that evening in his area.\u201d\\r\\nWith the help of firefighters, Mr. Riley and other park officials searched the seared terrain, including the exact area of P-74\u2019s last known location, for any signs that he survived. But they came up with nothing, leading Mr. Riley to conclude that P-74 was trapped in the fire and his collar destroyed.\\r\\nNo other animals that are tracked by rangers, including coyotes and four bobcats, were believed to have died, he said.\\r\\nThe Woolsey Fire engulfed a swath of subdivisions and wildlife in the hills above Malibu, charring nearly 97,000 acres by the time firefighters were able to contain it on Nov. 21. A separate wildfire in Northern California, the Camp Fire, roared during the same period and has killed at least 88 people, though it was contained on Nov. 25. While many people lost homes, the Woolsey Fire also devastated the delicate urban habitat home to an estimated 10 to 15 mountain lions in the Santa Monica Mountains.\\r\\nThe Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area stretches about 154,000 acres in northwest Los Angeles County and is largely defined by Highway 101 to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the south. The imposing boundaries trap wildlife in the area and make it nearly impossible for newcomers to enter.\\r\\nAbout half of the park\u2019s natural area burned, destroying vegetation and small animals that could not outrun the fast-moving fire and smoke, Mr. Riley said. The region\u2019s population of wood rats was hit particularly hard, because they naturally retreat to their nests made of sticks when threatened.\\r\\n[Sign up for the Morning Briefing newsletter for a look at what you need to know to begin your day.]\\r\\nThe animals that did survive had to flee to the fertile and habitable areas that remain. Park rangers are closely monitoring how they adapt and survive in what is one of the largest urban wildlife areas in the world.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting and massive experiment,\u201d Mr. Riley said. \u201cYou eliminate the natural habitat from half of it, and then what is going to happen?\u201d\\r\\nWhile the site became a national recreation area in 1978, the park did not begin to track the mammals there until the 1990s, starting with bobcats and coyotes. In 2002, rangers started to trap mountain lions, affix GPS devices to them and map their movements.\\r\\nThe latest addition to the group was P-74, who wandered into a cage in mid-September that park rangers had set up with the remains of a recently killed deer. With his GPS collar attached, P-74 was spotted about a month later with a female mountain lion believed to be his mother.\\r\\nPark rangers do not know whether that female, which did not have a GPS collar, also died, Mr. Riley said.\\r\\nWhile all the other mountain lions with collars survived, rangers are still concerned about the health of one male named P-64, perhaps the most adventurous member of the group. Mr. Riley said that P-64 had found a safe way to travel between parts of the park separated by the busy Highway 101: through a narrow, dark tunnel under the highway.\\r\\nSince the Woolsey Fire, the GPS collar on P-64 has indicated that he is moving around but only in a several hundred yard area in the Simi Hills. For cats that travel more than a mile in a day, the lack of movement is concerning, Mr. Riley said.\\r\\nA park biologist was expected to visit the area of P-64\u2019s last location soon. The mountain lion, which was captured and tagged in February, could have been injured.\\r\\n\u201cClearly he survived the fire, but we are not sure what he is doing since then,\u201d Mr. Riley said. \u201cWe have some concerns.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1299341993,\"description\":\"P-74, the newest mountain lion electronically tracked by park rangers in the Santa Monica Mountains, was last seen in one of the first areas to be scorched in the blaze.\\r\",\"title\":\"Mountain Lion Tracked in Southern California Likely Died in Woolsey Fire, Park Says\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.25.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.__________\\r\\n\u201cType A Behavior and Your Heart,\u201d a 1970s best-selling book, claimed that heart disease was more likely among people who were involved in an \u201caggressive and incessant struggle to achieve more and more in less and less time.\u201d The connection with cardiac health has been questioned. But many managers could do with a different title: \u201cType A Behavior and Your Soul.\u201d Carlos Ghosn would be the prime exhibit.\\r\\nThe 64-year-old former multinational chief executive, now sitting in a Japanese jail, is the ultimate Type A personality. He hardly sleeps, pushed his way to the top of two large and troubled car companies \u2014 first Renault and then Nissan \u2014 and energetically broke a series of corporate and national industrial taboos to bring them to good health. He even acquired a nickname suited to a business action-movie superhero: \u201cLe Cost Killer.\u201d\\r\\nIt looks like Mr. Ghosn was too bold. Despite reported annual remuneration of close to $20 million, he stands accused of not disclosing his full Nissan pay. According to Japanese press reports, he also bought property in Lebanon and Brazil with company money, among other alleged transgressions.\\r\\nMr. Ghosn is in custody and has not spoken publicly about the allegations. But even if he did not break any rules, the disclosures suggest that an enormously successful, almost universally lauded and hugely wealthy executive thought he deserved more than a sum which looks absurdly high to most people.\\r\\nIt looks like a dismal end for a glorious career. The sudden reversal of fortune makes Mr. Ghosn something of a tragic hero. Here is a great man whose greatness is inseparable from a devastating character flaw.\\r\\nThe combination of greatness and great weakness is fairly common among successful chief executives. From General Electric\u2019s Jack Welch to film mogul Harvey Weinstein, the careers of many of the most dynamic and successful bosses have been tarnished by scandals of excess pay, sexual intimidation or reckless risk-taking.\\r\\nThe tragic curse is closely connected to the professional blessing. The restless confidence and endless desire to get things done which leads to breaking established corporate patterns and reshaping cultures can sometimes also lead to inappropriate efforts to satisfy what the Bible calls the \u201cthe lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life\u201d \u2014 the desire for inordinate quantities of sex, money and power.\\r\\nIn other words, Type-A transgressions that initially spur corporate success can easily slip into classic individual sins. The tendency is not exclusively corporate. Power has been corrupting rulers for millenniums. However, emperors and kings often escaped punishment because they were considered quasi-divine and were therefore allowed to behave differently from lesser mortals.\\r\\nCorporate bosses are an uncomfortable hybrid of chief and executive. They are paid and honored like royalty, but are expected to follow the same rules and show the same restraint as every other employee. Type-A behavior often enhances the chief side of the job, but is always an imperfect fit with good conduct.\\r\\nCompanies have four lines of defense to avoid Mr. Ghosn-style debacles. Each of them needs to be kept strong.\\r\\n\u2022 The first is bureaucracy. Like all of their underlings, chief executives are expected to subject their decisions to committees and submit to audit trails and standard rules of conduct. These systems never work perfectly, but without them there would be far more tales of Type-A bosses suffering from the ethical equivalent of cardiac arrest. Still, additional bureaucratic checks \u2014 say regular personalized audits and a direct line between whistle-blowers and the board of directors \u2014 might be even more effective.\\r\\n\u2022 The board is the second firewall. Powerful bosses all too often choose directors who are Type-B weaklings and give them a free hand. Without genuine discipline from strong, cautious types, though, the boss\u2019s lack of restraint is all too likely to wander into inappropriate pursuits. A special committee to supervise the chief executive, made up of truly independent directors, could help.\\r\\n\u2022 Third comes the conscience of the boss. Successful Type-A people are usually very persuasive, and can usually persuade themselves that, say, very high salaries do not provide an adequate reward for their exceptional contributions. It is hard to stimulate helpful self-doubt, but mandatory spiritual retreats are worth a try. Or perhaps, like absolute monarchs of the past, bosses need court jesters with a license to tell the chief executive some hard truths.\\r\\n\u2022 Finally, there is punishment. Fear can helpfully concentrate otherwise unwilling minds. Imprisoning, impoverishing and shaming one or two bosses will not discourage many egomaniacs. Their confidence that they should be judged by different standards is remarkably hard to shake. However, as chief executive pay has risen, punishment has declined. Both trends make moral errors more likely.\\r\\nThe common theme in all of these defenses is disbelief. If underlings, directors, shareholders and prosecutors did not think that the big boss walked on water, professionally speaking, then bad behavior would be less tolerated. Then future cost killers and company builders would be less likely to also destroy their souls.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1042698165,\"description\":\"There are four obvious lines of defense that can be used to stop chief executives from engulfing themselves and their companies in scandal.\\r\",\"title\":\"Breakingviews: How to Stop Radical C.E.O.s From Going Rogue\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"business.12.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"\u201cMommy? I threw up.\u201d\\r\\nThe phrase is uttered so innocently, but it incites in me an immediate dark panic. I know right then \u2014 which way too often is in the middle of the night \u2014 that my vomiting child probably has a stomach virus, and that our family has just begun another weeklong round of ring-around-the-toilet. First it\u2019ll be my son, then my daughter, then me, then my husband. My symptoms, for some reason, are the worst. The first time my husband saw me with a stomach bug, he said, \u201cI really thought you were going to die.\u201d\\r\\nSo which stomach bug is responsible? Salmonella? The flu? No, it\u2019s probably norovirus, which causes the vast majority of stomach bugs in the United States. Research suggests that noroviruses can survive on surfaces for as long as 42 days, and it takes only about 20 viral particles to make a person sick. Yet one tablespoon of vomit contains a whopping 15 million viruses, and the same amount of stool contains up to 75 billion of the buggers. So \u201cif it does spread in your house, it\u2019s not your fault,\u201d said Eli Perencevich, a physician and epidemiologist at the University of Iowa. (Small consolation, though, if you\u2019re puking everywhere.)\\r\\nNow that we\u2019re again approaching winter \u2014 a.k.a., norovirus season \u2014 I\u2019ve decided to arm myself against stomach bugs with science, and you should, too. Here\u2019s how.\\r\\nKeep your hands and the bathroom clean\\r\\nWhen someone in your household gets sick, everyone in the family needs to wash their hands frequently with soap. Focus on scrubbing fingertips and nailbeds, where viruses linger. Hand sanitizers, sadly, aren\u2019t effective.\\r\\nIf you can, quarantine the sick. Keep them home, of course, and ideally in one part of the house. If you\u2019re fortunate enough to have a home with multiple bathrooms, designate one as the \u201csick\u201d one that healthy family members don\u2019t use.\\r\\nIf that\u2019s not possible, or if everyone has to share a bathroom, \u201cI would not call it overkill to clean surfaces every time\u201d a sick person uses the toilet, said Mary Wikswo, viral epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\r\\nThis means cleaning the toilet, the handle, the sink, the doorknob \u2014 anything that a sick person or his or her fluids might have touched. Close the toilet lid before every flush, too, and maybe even flush a second time after pouring in a half cup to a cup of bleach.\\r\\nCleaning wipes don\u2019t work. Get the right gear.\\r\\nA little-known fact about noroviruses is that many household cleaners and wipes don\u2019t kill them. Clorox and Lysol Disinfecting wipes claim to kill 99.9 percent of viruses and bacteria, but that doesn\u2019t include noroviruses. Your best bet is to wipe down surfaces with a bleach solution \u2014 mix between a half cup and cup of bleach with a gallon of water \u2014 or to use health-care-grade bleach wipes, such as Clorox Healthcare Bleach Germicidal Wipes, which are hard to find in stores but are sold on websites like Amazon. Let the bleach sit on the surface for at least five minutes, ideally 10, because it takes time to kill these resilient jerks. Hydrogen peroxide cleaners are another effective option.\\r\\nIf a family member doesn\u2019t make it to the toilet in time, you\u2019ll have to clean up even more carefully. Angela Fraser, a researcher at Clemson University who studies vomit and fecal cleanup strategies (seriously!), suggests that you wear disposable gloves and goggles. Dr. Perencevich said a face mask is good, too, because it keeps you from touching your mouth. In any case, \u201creally concentrate on not touching your face while you\u2019re doing all this,\u201d he says.\\r\\nTo keep the viruses from becoming airborne as you clean, cover the fluid with paper towels, or shake kitty litter or sawdust on it, before scooping it all into a plastic bag. Then close it with a twist tie and dispose of it. Scrub the area with soap and water and then disinfect it with one of the cleaners mentioned above.\\r\\nAlso, don\u2019t just clean where you saw the fluid. Dr. Fraser recommends sanitizing a 25-foot radius, including walls, table legs and any other surfaces that might have been inadvertently sprinkled with virus. (The good news is that by the time you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll have reached your 30 minutes of exercise for the day.)\\r\\nIf you have to disinfect a rug or upholstered furniture, you probably can\u2019t use bleach because it will cause color damage. If you have a steam cleaner, use it for five minutes at 170 degrees Fahrenheit, Dr. Fraser said. Dr. Perencevich said that another option is to spray it with a hydrogen peroxide cleaner after testing that it won\u2019t cause damage.\\r\\nIf clothes or washable linens get soiled, either wash them in a washing machine on the \u201chot\u201d or \u201csanitize\u201d setting (ideally with a half cup of bleach, if bleaching won\u2019t damage them) or put them in a plastic bag and quarantine them for a few days or weeks, because every time you handle soiled clothes, you risk spreading the virus, Dr. Perencevich said. Consider also designating specific plates, utensils and cups for sick family members, because some dishwashers don\u2019t eliminate all noroviruses. And don\u2019t let anyone who\u2019s sick prepare food for anyone else.\\r\\nStick to science, and do what you can\\r\\nSpeaking of things that don\u2019t kill noroviruses: Drinking grape juice or apple cider vinegar won\u2019t keep you healthy, despite what friends may have told you. (I know, I really wanted to believe it, too.) These \u201ccures\u201d supposedly work because they change the pH of the stomach, making it too acidic for noroviruses to grow. But \u201cnorovirus grows in the small intestine, so changing the stomach environment is really not going to do you much good,\u201d Dr. Wikswo said.\\r\\nIf this all sounds overwhelming, I hear you. Do what you can. And there is good news: Some people are naturally more resistant to noroviruses because of genetic mutations that affect sugars found on cell surfaces. People with B or AB blood types are more resistant, too. (Of course, I\u2019m type O.) And most of the time, noroviruses are more unpleasant than they are dangerous. Maybe \u201cunpleasant\u201d is too generous a word, but the other words I\u2019m thinking of aren\u2019t fit for print. I\u2019ll be yelling them into my toilet the next time I get sick, though, that\u2019s for sure.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1443018166,\"description\":\"It can survive on surfaces for days, is tricky to kill, and is the source of most stomach bugs in America.

It is not clear how the Kurdish captives were killed.\\r\\nThe captured operative, Jamal al-Mashadani, who was known by the nom de guerre Abu Hamza al-Kurdi, was an officer in President Saddam Hussein\u2019s security apparatus before joining Al Qaeda in Iraq after Mr. Hussein\u2019s fall. Mr. Mashadani later shifted his loyalty to the Islamic State.\\r\\nHe is one of a relatively small number of midlevel and higher level officials to have been captured by the Iraqis, the Americans or through the combined efforts of American and Iraqi intelligence services. Five other Islamic State officials were captured in May. The Iraqis have also captured several thousand lower-level fighters. Many other Islamic State officials and fighters were killed in battle.\\r\\nIn a 17-minute confession video released by Iraqi intelligence on Friday, Mr. Mashadani, who appears to be solidly built and balding with a salt-and-pepper beard, says that he was born in 1973 and is from Tarmiya, a town north of Baghdad, and that he graduated from Iraq\u2019s College of National Security in 1992 before joining the country\u2019s military intelligence.\\r\\nThere was no way to tell if the confession had been coerced or obtained through torture. Iraq has a record of disregarding due process protections and using confessions as evidence of guilt.\\r\\nMr. Mashadani, unlike many of the foreign fighters who came to Iraq and Syria from elsewhere to support the Islamic State, had technical and organizational skills that the group needed to expand its reach.\\r\\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the real professionals and brains who built ISIS, the faces not usually recognized in discussions about the group,\u201d said Hassan Hassan, the author of a book tracing the rise of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.\\r\\nHe added that Mr. Mashadani was \u201cone of the little-known but critical leaders within ISIS who served under Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime.\u201d\\r\\nWhile not a senior leader, Mr. Mashadani held important midlevel managerial positions within the Islamic State. More important, he is among the trained cadre of military and intelligence professionals that the group, much like Al Qaeda before it, was able to recruit from the ranks of Mr. Hussein\u2019s dissolved police state.\\r\\nMr. Hassan says that Mr. Mashadani was involved in the terrorist group\u2019s chemical weapons program. He also served as the Islamic State\u2019s governor in Kirkuk and in northern Baghdad, two administrative areas that had belonged to the Islamic State\u2019s Britain-sized caliphate.\\r\\nAmerican officials familiar with Mr. Mashadani confirmed his role in the organization and that he was captured.\\r\\nHe had previously been captured by the Americans in 2006 and imprisoned at Camp Cropper, one of the two major detention centers run by the United States. He was released in mid-2011, he said in the video, and joined the Islamic State two years later.\\r\\nHis detention in an American facility was considerably longer than that of the Islamic State\u2019s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who spent a little less than a year in an American prison in Bucca, Iraq.\\r\\nIn the video, Mr. Mashadani detailed his involvement in the Islamic State, including his meetings in 2014 with Mr. Baghdadi, whom he said gathered the governors of different Iraqi provinces in Mosul to give them instructions on running their areas and to have joint discussions on issues such as what to do with the \u201cspoils\u201d that the Islamic State commanders took from people in areas they captured.\\r\\nLater, Mr. Mashadani moved to Kirkuk as the Islamic State governor, he said, and there he supervised or was involved in several higher profile operations. They included the bombing of the small northern town of Taza with rockets, some of which were loaded with chemical agents \u2014 sulfur mustard and chlorine \u2014 that seeped out although few if any exploded, according to news reports at the time.\\r\\nHe then was involved in the operation that captured the Kurdish pesh merga soldiers, although he says that 18 were captured, not 21, the number given in news reports and by Iraqi intelligence. The pesh merga were dressed in orange jumpsuits and paraded around the city of Hawija in cages \u201cto lift morale\u201d of Islamic State supporters, Mr. Mashadani said.\\r\\nLater that year, Mr. Mashadani participated in Islamic State operations near the ancient Roman ruins of Palmyra, Syria, which was taken by the Islamic State in 2015 and held for about a year. By then, the Islamic State\u2019s power and geographic reach had shrunk drastically, but he still appears to have been entrenched: He held several administrative positions, some involving considerable responsibility.\\r\\nIn 2017, he decided to leave Syria and the Islamic State, he said.\\r\\nHe cited as reasons for his departure the bombing by coalition forces, the targeting of commanders like himself and the \u201cpoor management\u201d by some of Mr. Baghdadi\u2019s lieutenants.\\r\\nHe was captured at his son\u2019s house in Baghdad, he said. Iraqi intelligence confirmed that he was captured in Baghdad.\\r\\nThat he was captured relatively close to his family home in Tarmiya suggests that some Islamic State fighters who have not been killed may be trying to return to their homes and meld into the local population.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1843556299,\"description\":\"The captured operative was a midlevel official best known for having paraded captured Kurdish soldiers in cages.\\r\",\"title\":\"ISIS Official Known for Caging Foes Is Captured by Iraq\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"world.9.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"HONG KONG \u2014 Jack Ma, China\u2019s richest man and the guiding force behind its biggest e-commerce company, belongs to an elite club of power brokers, 89 million strong: the Chinese Communist Party.\\r\\nThe party\u2019s official People\u2019s Daily newspaper included Mr. Ma, executive chairman of the Alibaba Group and the country\u2019s most prominent capitalist, in a list it published on Monday of 100 Chinese people who had made extraordinary contributions to the country\u2019s development over the last 40 years. The entry for Mr. Ma identified him as a party member.\\r\\nIt may sound contradictory that the wealthy Mr. Ma belongs to an organization that got its start calling for the empowerment of the proletariat. But Mr. Ma\u2019s political affiliation came as no surprise to many Chinese and China watchers. Though it still publicly extols the principles of Karl Marx, the Chinese Communist Party largely abandoned collectivist doctrine in the post-Mao era, freeing private entrepreneurs to help build the world\u2019s second-largest economy after the United States.\\r\\nIn fact, the disclosure reveals a party that is eager to prove its legitimacy by affiliating itself with capitalist success stories. Mr. Ma is a tech rock star in China, and his membership in the party could prod others to follow his lead.\\r\\n\u201cEven Jack Ma is a party member,\u201d said Kellee Tsai, dean of humanities and social science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, referring to the party\u2019s pitch. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it make you want to join the party, too?\u201d\\r\\nAlibaba declined to comment on the matter. The Hurun Report, a research organization in Shanghai that tracks the wealthy in China, estimates Mr. Ma and his family\u2019s net worth at 270 billion renminbi, or $39 billion.\\r\\nToday\u2019s party isn\u2019t exactly exclusive. Its members represent nearly 7 percent of China\u2019s population. Its ranks include government officials, businesspeople and even dissidents. Being a member often suggests a desire to network and get ahead rather than express one\u2019s political views.\\r\\nFor businesspeople in particular, membership is more often a matter of expediency. Party membership provides a layer of protection in a country where private ownership protections are often haphazardly enforced or ignored entirely.\\r\\nThough its constitution still describes members as \u201cvanguard fighters of the Chinese working class imbued with communist consciousness,\u201d the party has veered away from its communist roots and welcomed private entrepreneurs since 2001. Some of the richest men in China are party members, including Wang Jianlin of the Dalian Wanda Group, a property and entertainment conglomerate, and Xu Jiayin of the Evergrande Group, a property developer.\\r\\nIt is unclear when Mr. Ma joined the party or how much he pays in dues. The party sets dues at 2 percent of monthly salary for higher-income members.\\r\\nThe star power of the Chinese entrepreneur class has dimmed since Xi Jinping became the country\u2019s top leader in 2012. Under Mr. Xi, the Communist Party plays a bigger role in not only Chinese politics but also the economy and everyday life. Any entity with more than three party members is required to set up a party cell. Some three-quarters of private enterprises, or 1.9 million, had done so in 2017, according to official data.\\r\\nCompanies say they face much greater pressure to set up the cells than in the past. Even some of the coolest start-ups in tech-savvy Beijing have designated party-building spaces.\\r\\nThe disclosure of Mr. Ma\u2019s membership reflects the thinking that the party controls the economy and society, said Guo Yuhua, a sociology professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing and a critic of the party.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s going backward from the Deng Xiaoping era, when the party advocated the separation of the party and the government,\u201d she said, referring to the party leader who ultimately governed China during its early years of reform in the 1970s and \u201980s.\\r\\nThe disclosure also drew attention because Mr. Ma had in the past tried to keep his distance from the government. When asked at public appearances how he managed government relations, he often said, \u201cFall in love with the government, but don\u2019t get married.\u201d\\r\\nBut as Mr. Xi tightens ideological controls and the power of the state grows, many successful entrepreneurs have made a point of showing their party loyalty.\\r\\nMr. Ma visited Yan\u2019an, the city often considered the birthplace of the Chinese Communist Revolution, in 2015, according to the Chinese news media. Pony Ma, who is chief executive of the internet giant Tencent Holdings but is not a party member, nonetheless showed up in Yan\u2019an as well this year, wearing a Red Army uniform. Yan\u2019an is also where Mr. Xi spent much of his teenage years.\\r\\nIn recent weeks, amid signs of a slowing economy and an intensifying trade war with the United States, China\u2019s leaders have taken a softer tone toward private enterprise, making supportive remarks and promising tax cuts.\\r\\nMaking it clear that Mr. Ma, the most successful businessman in China, is a member could strengthen the party\u2019s legitimacy.\\r\\n\u201cAbove all,\u201d said Ms. Tsai of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, \u201cthe party is quite open about the fact that it wants to survive.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":768893525,\"description\":\"Many business figures join the organization out of expedience.

Ihor Voronchenko, acknowledged.\\r\\nInstead, Ukraine has proposed that Turkey, a member of NATO, seal off the Bosporus, one of the world\u2019s busiest waterways, and that the alliance send a convoy into the Sea of Azov.\\r\\nThe chances of any of that happening are near zero, but the Ukrainian commander\u2019s Hail Mary proposal highlights the extent to which the country is dependent on outside help as it struggles to hold its own as a sovereign state in the face of a hostile Kremlin.\\r\\nThe episode has also put a spotlight on a vexing question that has dogged Ukraine\u2019s efforts to break out of Moscow\u2019s orbit since its 2014 revolution: Just how far is the West willing to go to help a country addled by corruption but, for all its problems, offers its citizens liberties, including real elections and a free press, that Mr. Putin has ground to dust in Russia?\\r\\nNearly a week after Russia opened fire on Ukrainian naval vessels passing from the Black Sea to the adjoining Sea of Azov, there is little agreement on what triggered the sudden escalation in a four-year-long confrontation between the two neighbors: a power play by Moscow or just a minor \u201cborder incident, nothing more,\u201d as Mr. Putin said.\\r\\nWhat is not in dispute, though, is that Ukraine is now in a curious state of high anxiety. Officials are warning that the country could well face a major war with Russia while insisting that a declaration of martial law will have no effect on ordinary life.\\r\\nTensions were raised further on Friday when Russia said it was transferring the three Ukrainian ship captains to Moscow and Ukraine said all Russian men between the ages of 16 and 60 would be barred from entering the country.\\r\\nYet, for the capital of a country now on a war footing, Kiev seems bizarrely calm. The only tangible signs of panic are the anxious phone calls and email messages from friends and relatives living abroad and wild accounts in the Russian news media of Ukrainians digging trenches and stocking food.\\r\\n\u201cPeople I haven\u2019t heard from in years are contacting me in a panic to ask whether I am safe,\u201d said Andrew Bain, a retired United States Marine Corps officer who served in Iraq and now runs a business in the Ukranian capital. \u201cIt is fairly comical given how calm Kiev is.\u201d\\r\\nUkraine\u2019s desperate pleas for help, however, have put its friends abroad in an agonizing dilemma: how to support the country without stoking an even wider conflict or playing into Ukraine\u2019s labyrinthine political feuds before the presidential election in March.\\r\\nAs has often been the case since relations with its neighbor curdled after the ouster of Ukraine\u2019s pro-Russian president in 2014, Kiev says it is not appealing for charity but simply to the self-interest of the United States and its allies.\\r\\n\u201cUkraine is now protecting the Western world, not only itself,\u201d Admiral Voroncheko told a meeting in Kiev on Thursday attended by a counterpart from the United States Sixth Fleet, a British naval commander, foreign military attach\u00e9s and other military experts.\\r\\nFor more than four years, ever since Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine and fomented a separatist rebellion in the country\u2019s Russian-speaking east, the Ukrainian military has managed to hold Russia and rebels armed by Moscow to a standstill in a grinding, undeclared war of attrition on land. More than 10,000 people have been killed.\\r\\nBut the clash at sea last weekend marked the first time the Russian military has confronted Ukraine openly instead of through special forces without insignia and local proxies. That has opened a dangerous new front in which Ukraine knows it cannot possibly prevail on its own.\\r\\nDozens of shipping vessels have been left stranded, unable to enter or exit the Sea of Azov because of what Ukraine has described as effectively a naval blockade of cities on its southeastern coast.\\r\\nFear that Russia intends to slowly strangle a coastal region that is still under the control of the government in Kiev but perilously close to territory occupied by Russian-backed separatists has led to a flurry of anguished appeals in Kiev for political and military help.\\r\\n\u201cWe obviously can\u2019t compete with Russia by force,\u201d said Hanna Hopko, chairwoman of the Ukrainian Parliament\u2019s foreign affairs committee.\\r\\nMs. Hopko and others are demanding tougher sanctions on Russia to deter what they describe as brazen aggression at sea. Europe, already divided over whether to continue existing sanctions imposed in 2014, is split even further over any new measures.\\r\\nIt took the European Union three days to issue a simple statement expressing \u201cutmost concern\u201d over the events near Crimea and demand that Russia release the detained Ukrainian sailors.\\r\\nEven less likely to find much support is a proposal by the president of Ukraine, Petro O. Poroshenko, that NATO send warships into the disputed Sea of Azov. NATO says it has no plans to do this.\\r\\nRussian efforts to impede access to the Sea of Azov, which is guaranteed by a treaty signed by Moscow and Kiev in 2003, started the clash on Sunday, with Russia opening fire when three vessels from the Ukrainian Navy \u2014 two small gunboats and a tugboat \u2014 tried to enter through the Kerch Strait between Russia and Crimea.\\r\\nRussia denies doing anything wrong, despite photographs showing what look like large holes in at least one Ukrainian ship from shell fire, and it accused Kiev of provoking the crisis at the behest of the United States.\\r\\nPresident Trump, after initially suggesting that both sides were to blame for the flaring tensions, on Thursday tilted toward supporting Ukraine, or at least its demand that Russia return its seized ships and sailors.\\r\\nMr. Trump also  announced that he was canceling a meeting planned with Mr. Putin at a get-together of leaders of the G-20 industrialized nations in Argentina because of the Russian actions at sea. But Ukraine wants far more than just a gesture of sympathy from the president.\\r\\nWarships from the United States regularly cruise the Black Sea but have avoided passing into the Sea of Azov under a new Russia-built bridge to Crimea across the Kerch Strait. Anders Aslund, a Russia expert at the Atlantic Council, said the United States must be more assertive if Mr. Putin is to be restrained, but there is little appetite in Washington to put American sailors in harm\u2019s way.\\r\\nThere are also concerns that a highly unpopular Mr. Poroshenko has seized on the crisis to lift his flagging political fortunes and muffle his many critics before the presidential election. Western diplomats in Kiev said they were particularly concerned by the president\u2019s decision to impose martial law, which was approved in a watered-down form by a large majority of legislators.\\r\\nSpeaking in Kiev on Thursday, the American ambassador, Marie L. Yovanovitch, described the firing on Ukrainian naval vessels and the capture of their sailors by Russia as a \u201cdangerous escalation and part of a pattern of Russia\u2019s malign activities.\u201d But she also called the imposition of martial law a \u201cgrave decision\u201d and added that the way it is carried out \u201cwill be closely watched.\u201d\\r\\nMs. Hopko, the foreign affairs committee chairwoman, dismissed worries that civil liberties could be at risk, saying that those fears had been fueled by Russian propaganda painting Ukraine as a lawless land overrun by fascists.\\r\\nAndrii Klymenko, chairman of Maidan of Foreign Affairs, a research group in Kiev that has monitored Russian restrictions on shipping in the Sea of Azov, said Moscow had sharply increased efforts to impede access to the sea after Mr. Putin opened the new bridge in May, built at a cost of more than $3 billion by a construction company owned by a close friend of the president.\\r\\nAfter letting ships pass freely for years, Russia stopped 21 vessels in May, 25 in June and 40 in July, he said.

Several investigations into his behavior at the agency are still pending, and he also faces a possible Department of Justice inquiry into his involvement in a land deal in Whitefish, Mont., linked to the energy giant Halliburton. \\r\\nMr. Zinke\u2019s spokeswoman, Heather Swift, did not respond to requests for comment about the national monument investigation. \\r\\nMr. Noel, reached by phone in Utah on Tuesday, said he felt vindicated. He called the investigation, requested by the Western Values Project, an environmental watchdog group, \u201cpretty spurious\u201d and said he spent more than two hours speaking with federal investigators who traveled to Utah to interview him. \\r\\nThe Associated Press earlier reported on the inspector general\u2019s findings.\\r\\nThe Western Values Project had claimed that Mr. Noel \u2014 who had toured the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument with Mr. Zinke during a review last year of the boundaries \u2014 failed to properly disclose that he owned 40 acres of land within the monument. The land was ultimately removed from the monument boundaries. Mr. Noel on Tuesday said he owns thousands of acres of land in the region, adding, \u201cThere was really nothing to report because I have never talked to the secretary about any of my property.\u201d \\r\\nRepresentative Raul Grijalva of Arizona, a Democrat who is expected to chair the House Natural Resources Committee next year, said in a statement he accepts the results of the investigation into Mr. Zinke. He also said that \u201cthe process he and President Trump used to destroy Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante will be front and center in our oversight and investigations efforts\u201d when Democrats formally take control of the House.\\r\\nChris Saeger, director of the Western Values Project, criticized the Interior Department for not releasing the full investigative report.\\r\\nRepresentative Rob Bishop of Utah, the current Republican chairman of committee, noted in a statement that the inspector general found Mr. Zinke acted in good faith. \u201cThis investigation\u2019s closure marks the end of one politically-motivated attack against Secretary Zinke\u2019s efforts to empower local communities against government overreach,\u201d he said.\\r\\nShortly after taking office, President Trump launched a review of about two dozen national monuments. From the start, though, Bears Ears National Monument (created by former President Obama in 2016) and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument (created by President Clinton in 1996) were in the administration\u2019s cross hairs, with Mr. Trump calling their creation an \u201cegregious use of federal power.\u201d\\r\\nIn December, Mr. Trump announced he would shrink Bears Ears by 85 percent and diminish Grand Staircase nearly by half, from its original 1.9 million acres to 1 million acres.\\r\\nFor more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1195195447,\"description\":\"The investigation looked at whether he had redrawn the boundaries of a national monument in Utah to avoid the nearby land holdings of a state lawmaker and supporter of President Donald Trump.\\r\",\"title\":\"Interior Department Watchdog Clears Zinke of Wrongdoing in National Monument Inquiry\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.23.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"German law enforcement authorities targeted offices of the Deutsche Bank management board Friday as they spent a second day gathering evidence in an investigation into whether the bank helped clients launder money in an offshore tax haven.\\r\\nSearches at the top level of management significantly raised the stakes for Deutsche Bank, which was already reeling at the prospect of another scandal.

And the expectations had never been higher: Love and his Cavaliers teammates won an N.B.A. championship the year before and were widely expected to return to the N.B.A. Finals.\\r\\nThen, in the middle of a game on Nov. 5 against the Atlanta Hawks, Love \u2014 a five-time N.B.A. All-Star and an Olympic gold medalist \u2014 had his first panic attack.\\r\\n\u201cI thought I was fully having a heart attack and that I was going to die,\u201d he recalled in an interview on Thursday night with Juliet Macur, a Sports of The Times columnist.\\r\\nLove recounted his harrowing experience as part of a broad discussion of mental health and sports culture at a New York Times live event at Tufts University. During an hourlong interview with Ms. Macur, Love spoke about the struggle to be open about his feelings and acknowledged that he was initially afraid that if he spoke openly about his battle with depression and anxiety, his teammates would think he was \u201cweak\u201d and \u201cunreliable.\u201d\\r\\nThe event, the latest edition of a conversation series called Get With The Times, was shown live and broadcast to watch parties held on college campuses across the country.\\r\\n\u201cI really truly believe that everybody is going through something,\u201d he said, echoing what he wrote in a deeply personal essay in The Players\u2019 Tribune in March, several months after the panic attack.\\r\\nSince the publication of his essay, Love has emerged as a high-profile voice on the topic of mental health. Around the same time as the essay, another player, DeMar DeRozan, who then played for the Toronto Raptors, spoke out about his depression. Several other players have discussed their mental health struggles, and in May, the N.B.A. appointed its first director of mental health.\\r\\nThough Love said Thursday that he was initially uneasy about how his article would be received, thousands of positive emails came pouring in; he heard from close friends who were deeply affected; and employees of other teams have pulled him aside to say they are glad he got the conversation started.\\r\\n\u201cThe biggest thing in my 11-year career so far that I\u2019ve done has been this,\u201d he said.\\r\\nAnd as for how his teammates would react? Love said he was on a bus with his team in Denver soon after the essay was published when his former teammate Kyle Korver immediately told him he wanted to find a way to help. As the team walked off the bus, Love said, LeBron James \u2014 who has poured money and time into various charitable endeavors \u2014 pulled Love aside, shook his hand and said, \u201cToday you helped a lot of people.\u201d\\r\\nDuring the event on Thursday, Love took questions from college students \u2014 both in the audience at Tufts and from other campuses via video.

But to the pests, there are far scarier dangers out there.\\r\\nTrue terror? That\u2019s getting zombified \u2014 and then eaten alive.\\r\\nWhen some unlucky American cockroaches encounter the emerald jewel wasp, the wasp delivers a paralyzing sting to the roach\u2019s body. Then, with surgeon-like precision, it injects a mind-altering cocktail into the roach\u2019s brain. The roach, now a zombie slave, is forced to cater to the wasp\u2019s every whim. But the wasp has only one desire: to reproduce.\\r\\nLike a handler leading a horse, the wasp grabs hold of the roach\u2019s antenna and steers it into a hole. There, it lays an egg on the roach that eventually hatches into a hungry larva that chows down on the cockroach. When the baby matures, it bursts from the roach\u2019s chest ready to continue the gruesome ritual.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of straight out of Alien,\u201d said Kenneth Catania, a biologist from Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, \u201cand it\u2019s about the only thing I can think of that\u2019ll make you feel sorry for a cockroach.\u201d\\r\\nBut as Dr. Catania has studied, some roaches defend themselves from the wasps with a swift and powerful karate kick.\\r\\nUsing high-speed cameras, Dr. Catania recorded scuffles between adult roaches and wasps in his lab and documented the cockroaches\u2019 defensive techniques in a paper published last month in the journal Brain, Behavior and Evolution.\\r\\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\\r\\nFirst, some roaches detected an intruding wasp with their antenna. Next, they raised themselves up, as if on stilts, and lifted their hind legs. And then they waited until just the right moment when the wasp tried to strike. In that instant, the roaches knocked back the would-be attacker with brutal kicks.\\r\\n\u201cIt reminded me in slow motion of one of those old Batman and Robin videos where you see the words \u2018Pow\u2019 appear on the screen,\u201d said Dr. Catania.\\r\\nRoaches\u2019 legs are covered in spikes that act like barbed wire, making the hit extra damaging.\\r\\nAlthough the strike doesn\u2019t kill the wasp, it makes the attacker back off. Dr. Catania found that 63 percent of the cockroaches that defended themselves were able to avoid getting stung by the wasp. But the roaches that didn\u2019t put up a fight nearly always got stung.\\r\\nScientists don\u2019t know why not every roach fights back, and Dr. Catania would like to study whether the kick evolved specifically to combat the wasp or as a general method of self-defense. \\r\\nWhatever the answer, it seems that striking the first blow keeps the American cockroach from becoming a mindless zombie.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":532103020,\"description\":\"Scientists documented the fancy footwork that helps some cockroaches fend off a wasp's paralyzing sting.\\r\",\"title\":\"ScienceTake: The Wasp Wants a Zombie.

No matter what form it took \u2014 creamy, crunchy, straight from the jar or smeared between two slices of bread \u2014 it caused Sunny Gold enormous anxiety.\\r\\nIn fact, the gooey spread posed such a threat that during her first few years of recovery from binge eating disorder, between 2006 and 2007, Ms. Gold, 42, a communications specialist in Portland, Ore., couldn\u2019t keep it around the house. It was one of her favorite foods, and she feared she would binge on it. Just knowing it was there, lurking in her cupboard, made her feel \u201cunsafe,\u201d as she put it.\\r\\nAnd that\u2019s when things got really tricky. Because her boyfriend at the time, John Pavlus, didn\u2019t think twice about peanut butter \u2014 or any food, for that matter. When Ms. Gold, the author of \u201cFood: The Good Girl\u2019s Drug,\u201d told him that it would be a casualty of her getting healthy, he was taken aback.\\r\\n\u201cIt was a bit uncomfortable for me at first,\u201d Mr. Pavlus, a 40-year-old writer and filmmaker, admitted. He knew that Ms. Gold had grappled with binge eating since she was a teenager, but food was something they\u2019d bonded over. So when she decided that she needed to \u201ccut herself off,\u201d he felt that he was losing something, \u201cless for the practical inconvenience than the unexpected feeling of being subtly disconnected from her,\u201d he said.\\r\\n\u201cIt was strange to think of these parts of our shared reality as being so radically \u2014 to me \u2014 redefined. Is peanut butter literally dangerous now? Does that mean I have to treat it that way too? Will it be like this forever?\u201d\\r\\nMr. Pavlus\u2019s reaction is echoed by many romantic partners of someone with an eating disorder, many of whom \u2014 though certainly not all \u2014 are women. Partners often want to help, but simply don\u2019t know how.\\r\\nOr else they have no idea there\u2019s a problem, or might not recognize its severity. Because the symptoms of anorexia nervosa, bulimia or binge eating disorder can be easy to miss, even if they\u2019re accompanied by drastic weight loss or a decrease in emotional or sexual intimacy.\\r\\nThe latter, after all, can happen during any relationship. As for the former, many people, especially men, don\u2019t recognize pathological behavior when it comes to women and food.\\r\\n\u201cI had a client who said he had three sisters and they were always dieting and thought they were fat,\u201d said Cynthia Bulik, a professor of eating disorders at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, and director of the Centre for Eating Disorders Innovation at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. When the client\u2019s wife developed a full-blown eating disorder, he was blindsided. He had thought her behavior was \u201cnormal.\u201d\\r\\nIn other instances, a partner might truly not see any changes, what Gayle Lewis, a New York psychologist who specializes in eating disorders and works with couples, calls \u201cunconscious collusion.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve worked with anorexics who are incredibly thin to the point of needing hospitalization,\u201d she said. \u201cI once asked a spouse, \u2018Did you notice she was losing weight, or that her moods were changing?\u2019 His conscious response was, \u2018I see her every day, I didn\u2019t notice.\u2019 Her family didn\u2019t notice. No one confronted her about it.\u201d\\r\\nWhen he did discover the truth, he felt betrayed. Like any addiction, eating disorders involve hidden worlds that are kept secret from others. \u201cThe sense is, \u2018if you\u2019re lying to me about this, what else are you lying about?\u2019\u201d said Dr. Lewis. \\r\\nThere has been scant research focusing on romantic partners of people with eating disorders. But experts are now recognizing how critical a partner\u2019s response can be to recovery, and how partners are a critical part of treatment.\\r\\nSince the late \u201990s, family-based treatment, previously called the Maudsley approach, has been the therapy of choice for treating children and adolescents with anorexia and bulimia. But adult patients were usually treated individually. \u201cWe would never involve the partners in actual treatment,\u201d said Dr. Bulik.\\r\\nIn 2006, Dr. Bulik and Donald H. Baucom, a professor of psychology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, decided to do just that, enlisting partners in the treatment process in a study of 20 couples, one of whom had anorexia. Results showed encouraging improvements in weight-gain and a lessening of anxiety and depression along with a low dropout rate, a perennial problem when treating any kind of eating disorder.\\r\\n\u201cThat\u2019s really a significant outcome, because in other treatments up to 50 percent of people leave outpatient treatment,\u201d said Dr. Bulik. \u201cWe can\u2019t treat people if they don\u2019t come to the office.\u201d\\r\\nIn a recent study of 11 couples working with a therapist \u2014 this one focused on binge eating disorders \u2014 researchers, including Dr. Bulik and Dr. Baucom, found that by the end of the trial, after 22 weeks, 82 percent of patients had stopped binge eating, which they maintained for up to three months (the researchers had funding for only three months of follow-up). The researchers also noticed a major reduction in depression, along with a low dropout rate.\\r\\n\u201cI think it is very important to instead think about couples as dealing with the eating disorder together,\u201d said Deanna Linville, an associate professor of couples and family therapy at the University of Oregon, in Eugene. \u201cThey both need to figure out how to best support each other and connect and communicate as a team.\u201d\\r\\nThat\u2019s what Lauren and Brandon Hill learned to do. Ms. Hill, 29, met her husband in 2012, about two months after she had completed inpatient treatment for anorexia. She\u2019d been wrestling with the disorder since she was 13 and had been hospitalized for it five times.\\r\\nThroughout the years, she\u2019d been with both helpful and hurtful partners, like the college boyfriend who told her that \u201cno one is ever going to love you or deal with you.\u2019\u201d\\r\\nWhen she met Mr. Hill, she wasn\u2019t sure how he was going to react to her illness. But she decided to be honest. \u201cI told him that I had just gotten out of treatment and was seeing a dietitian and therapist and trying to get better,\u201d said Ms. Hill, of Wilmington, N.C. \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem freaked out by it.\u201d\\r\\nHe wasn\u2019t. But he was, he said, \u201cuneducated.\u201d He didn\u2019t realize how huge an impact the eating disorder had on her life, and would soon have on his.\\r\\nFor example, Mr. Hill liked to cook. But Ms. Hill didn\u2019t want anyone to cook for her; she needed to be in control of her meals. Her illness \u201climited our ability to have a variety of foods in the house,\u201d said Mr. Hill, 32, a training specialist for a software company.\\r\\nIt also prevented her from being spontaneous; she was comfortable only in certain restaurants. The few times she did allow Mr. Hill to take her out, they had to order something \u201csafe.\u201d But she didn\u2019t enjoy herself, and her husband knew it.\\r\\n\u201cI always felt really guilty,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to do these things for him, but something was just not letting me.\u201d\\r\\nSeven months into their marriage, in 2013, she checked herself into the Eating Recovery Center, in Denver, for a three month stay.\\r\\nMr. Hill did telephone sessions with her and her therapist, and also flew in to do in-person therapy. He also went to support groups with spouses of other patients, along with some patients. They would hold a question and answer period to help spouses deal with their mates. He found it helpful to ask questions that he couldn\u2019t ask his wife, like what factors they felt contributed to her eating disorders, and why she had entered treatment now.\\r\\nWhen Ms. Hill returned home, the couple tried to figure out a way to make her recovery a joint effort. On weekends they planned their weekly menu, weaving in occasional \u201cchallenge meals.\u201d After eating, they\u2019d walk their dog or watch a movie. The idea was to \u201ctake away some of the power food has over you,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, the next time it\u2019s a little less scary. It\u2019s like I took a little bit of my power back, doing it one fear food at a time.\u201d\\r\\nLast November, Ms. Hill gave birth to a baby girl, something she never imagined doing. The weight gain was difficult, she admits. \u201cFor so long I had been obsessed with controlling my body, and all of a sudden it felt so out of control,\u201d said Ms. Hill, who is now a mental health counselor in private practice.\\r\\nShe credits Mr. Hill with helping her cope with her negative feelings. \u201cMy husband is very reassuring and tells me that I am beautiful and that he loves the way I look,\u201d she said.\\r\\nAs for Ms. Gold and Mr. Pavlus, they married in 2009 and have two children. Their relationship is strong, but they had to figure out some ground rules concerning food early on. When he questioned something she ate, even if it was a simple, \u201cAre you O.K. with that?\u201d she bristled.\\r\\n\u201cIt was like, ouch, you caught me!\u201d she said. \u201cOr, are you shaming me, as other people have shamed me in the past? Are you trying to be the food police?\u201d\\r\\nBut the more they talked, the more comfortable she felt telling him what she really needed. \u201cI said, \u2018Thank you, I know you love me, but I can take care of myself. I have my therapist. You just need to trust me. Don\u2019t watch me; be there for me. It\u2019s not your job to help me not binge.\u2019\u201d\\r\\nHer responses helped him to understand where she was coming from, and also put the onus squarely on her shoulders, and not his.\\r\\n\u201cI was never made to feel like it was my responsibility to police certain foods,\u201d he said. \u201cShe asked for my support in sticking to the choices that she decided she needed to make. And, frankly, the \u2018it\u2019s not necessarily forever\u2019 felt reassuring. I didn\u2019t want to imagine us never groaning in delight together over pizza or a crazy dessert ever again, even though \u2014 of course \u2014 I\u2019d be fine with it if that\u2019s what it took.\u201d\\r\\nMs. Gold still works on her relationship with her body and practices daily mindful eating. She has \u201cslip-ups\u201d a few times a year, when she might binge. Sometimes she shares this with her husband, but sometimes not.\\r\\nPeanut butter is now allowed in the house and not only in Mr. Pavlus\u2019s home office, along with sweets that aren\u2019t hidden. It can still be fraught, especially when Mr. Pavlus is out of town and Ms. Gold is juggling work and solo parenting. During such stressful moments, \u201cSomething like marshmallows or chocolate chips just aren\u2019t a great idea to have around,\u201d she said. She doesn\u2019t want to risk eating them, but wants her husband to be able to have them.\\r\\nUltimately, Mr. Pavlus said he liked being able to help support her in her recovery in this particular way. \u201cJust recently she asked me to hide some marshmallows where she\u2019d never find them, while I was away on a business trip,\u201d said Mr. Pavlus. \u201cI did it without a second thought, and with love.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1661884965,\"description\":\"Romantic partners of someone with an eating disorder often want to help, but simply don\u2019t know how.\\r\",\"title\":\"To Treat Eating Disorders, It Sometimes Takes Two\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"health.20.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Some of the most critical work in advancing China\u2019s technology goals takes place in a former cement factory in the middle of the country\u2019s heartland, far from the aspiring Silicon Valleys of Beijing and Shenzhen.

Two dozen young people go through photos and videos, labeling just about everything they see. That\u2019s a car. That\u2019s a traffic light. That\u2019s bread, that\u2019s milk, that\u2019s chocolate. That\u2019s what it looks like when a person walks.\\r\\n\u201cI used to think the machines are geniuses,\u201d Ms. Hou, 24, said. \u201cNow I know we\u2019re the reason for their genius.\u201d\\r\\nIn China, long the world\u2019s factory floor, a new generation of low-wage workers is assembling the foundations of the future. Start-ups in smaller, cheaper cities have sprung up to apply labels to China\u2019s huge trove of images and surveillance footage. If China is the Saudi Arabia of data, as one expert says, these businesses are the refineries, turning raw data into the fuel that can power China\u2019s A.I. ambitions.\\r\\nConventional wisdom says that China and the United States are competing for A.I. supremacy and that China has certain advantages. The Chinese government broadly supports A.I. companies, financially and politically. Chinese start-ups made up one third of the global computer vision market in 2017, surpassing the United States. Chinese academic papers are cited more often in research papers. In a key policy announcement last year, the China government said that it expected the country to become the world leader in artificial intelligence by 2030.\\r\\nMost importantly, this thinking goes, the Chinese government and companies enjoy access to mountains of data, thanks to weak privacy laws and enforcement. Beyond what Facebook, Google and Amazon have amassed, Chinese internet companies can get more because people there so heavily use their mobile phones to shop, pay for meals and buy movie tickets.\\r\\nStill, many of those claims are iffy. Chinese papers and patents can be suspect. Government money may go to waste. It isn\u2019t clear that the A.I. race is a zero sum game, in which the winner gets the spoils. Data is useless unless somebody can parse and catalog it.\\r\\nBut the ability to tag that data may be China\u2019s true A.I. strength, the only one that the United States may not be able to match. In China, this new industry offers a glimpse of a future that the government has long promised: an economy built on technology rather than manufacturing.\\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019re the construction workers in the digital world. Our job is to lay one brick after another,\u201d said Yi Yake, co-founder of a data labeling factory in Jiaxian, a city in central Henan province. \u201cBut we play an important role in A.I. Without us, they can\u2019t build the skyscrapers.\u201d\\r\\nWhile A.I. engines are superfast learners and good at tackling complex calculations, they lack cognitive abilities that even the average 5-year-old possesses. Small children know that a furry brown cocker spaniel and a black Great Dane are both dogs. They can tell a Ford pickup from a Volkswagen Beetle, and yet they know both are cars.\\r\\nA.I. has to be taught. It must digest vast amounts of tagged photos and videos before it realizes that a black cat and a white cat are both cats. This is where the data factories and their workers come in.\\r\\nTaggers helped AInnovation, a Beijing-based A.I. company, fix its automated cashier system for a Chinese bakery chain. Users could put their pastry under a scanner and pay for it without help from a human. But nearly one-third of the time, the system had trouble telling muffins from doughnuts or pork buns thanks to store lighting and human movement, which made images more complex. Working with photos from the store\u2019s interior, the taggers got the accuracy up to 99 percent, said Liang Rui, an AInnovation project manager.\\r\\n\u201cAll the artificial intelligence is built on human labor,\u201d Mr. Liang said.\\r\\nAInnovation has fewer than 30 taggers, but a surge in labeling start-ups has made it easy to farm out the work. Once, Mr. Liang needed to get about 20,000 photos in a supermarket labeled in three days. Colleagues got it done with the help of data factories for only a couple thousand dollars.\\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019re the assembly lines 10 years ago,\u201d said Mr. Yi, the co-founder of the data factory in Henan.\\r\\nThe data factories are popping up in areas far from the biggest cities, often in relatively remote areas where both labor and office space are cheap. Many of the data factory workers are the kinds of people who once worked on assembly lines and construction sites in those big cities. But work is drying up, wage growth has slowed and many Chinese people prefer to live closer to home.\\r\\nMr. Yi, 36, was out of a job and trying to get other ventures going with elementary school classmates when someone mentioned A.I. tagging. After online searches, he decided it wasn\u2019t super technical but needed cheap labor, something Henan has in abundance.\\r\\nIn March, Mr. Yi and his friends set up Ruijin Technology, which rents offices the size of two professional basketball courts in an industrial park for $21,000 a year. It was previously the park\u2019s Communist Party committee\u2019s event space, so the ceiling lights are covered with red hammers and sickles.\\r\\nRuijin, which means smart gold, now employs 300 workers but plans to expand to 1,000 after the Chinese New Year holiday, when many migrant workers come home.\\r\\nUnlike workers and business around the world, Mr. Yi isn\u2019t worried that A.I. will take his job.\\r\\n\u201cThe machines aren\u2019t smart enough to teach themselves yet,\u201d he said.\\r\\nHiring is a bigger worry.\\r\\nRuijin\u2019s pay of $400 to $500 a month is higher than average in Jiaxian. Some potential job candidates worry that they don\u2019t know anything about A.I. Others find the work boring.\\r\\nJin Weixiang, 19, said he would quit Ruijin after the Chinese New Year and go to sell furniture in a physical store in southern city Guangzhou.\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019m a people\u2019s person,\u201d said Mr. Jin. \u201cI\u2019m doing labeling for the money.\u201d\\r\\nBut for some former migrant workers, the job is better than working on assembly lines.\\r\\n\u201cIt was the same work, same movement, day after day,\u201d said Yi Zhenzhen, a 28-year-old Ruijin employee who once worked at an electronic component company. \u201cNow I have to use my brain a little bit.\u201d\\r\\nMost of the time, customers don\u2019t tell these data factories what the task is for. Some are obvious. Labeling traffic lights, road signs and pedestrians are usually for autonomous driving. Labeling many types of camellia flowers could be for search engines.\\r\\nOnce Ruijin was given the task of labeling the images of millions of human mouths. Mr. Yi said he wasn\u2019t sure what it was for. Maybe facial recognition?\\r\\nRoughly 300 miles to the north, in the Hebei city of Nangongshi, Hou Xiameng runs her data factory out of her in-laws\u2019 former cement factory. Her first job out of college was labeling faces for Megvii, the Chinese facial recognition company with a $2 billion valuation that\u2019s most famous for its technology platform called Face++. To this day, some facial recognition systems recognize her before they do her friends because, she says, \u201cmy face is in the original database.\u201d\\r\\nBut life in Beijing was too tough and expensive. She and her then-fianc\u00e9, Zhao Yacheng, decided to move back to their hometown and start a data factory. Ms. Hou\u2019s parents would pay for computers and desks. They are renovating the warehouse next door to hire 80 more people.\\r\\nLike Mr. Yi, Ms. Hou doesn\u2019t spend time thinking about the implications of her work. Are they contributing to a surveillance state and a dystopian future that machines will control human?\\r\\n\u201cCameras make me feel safe,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in control of the machines for now.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-935213790,\"description\":\"If China is the Saudi Arabia of data, its data factories are the refineries, turning raw data into the fuel that can power China\u2019s goal of A.I. supremacy.\\r\",\"title\":\"The New New World: How Cheap Labor Drives China\u2019s A.I.

What\u2019s less usual is that the two papers he relies on, the Vossische Zeitung and the Berliner Tageblatt, have been out of print for more than seven decades.\\r\\nIn the papers \u2014 which he reads front to back on microfilm in the city\u2019s old state library, weeks\u2019 worth in one sitting \u2014 he finds news of violent demonstrations, rising rents, traffic accidents, robberies and murders. He finds reviews of risqu\u00e9 cabarets, modern theater and promising new media (talking films). And in federal politics, there is endless news of weak coalition governments that take far too long to form.\\r\\nTo modern Germans all this \u201cnews\u201d would seem eerily familiar.\\r\\nThe ritual is part of a painstaking research effort that has led to a series of seven best-selling detective novels and \u201cBabylon Berlin,\u201d a blockbuster TV series based on them. The books and the TV show, set in the Berlin of the 1920s and \u201930s, have fed into a national discussion about the Weimar Republic, the roots of German democracy, the unfathomable rise of the Nazis and the pressing question of whether history might be repeating itself.\\r\\nMr. Kutscher has sold more than 1.7 million books in Germany, while tens of millions have watched the TV show there. Two of his books are in print in the United States, with at least two more coming, and Netflix is offering \u201cBabylon Berlin\u201d in America.\\r\\n\u201cHis trick is ingenious,\u201d said Tom Tykwer, the principal creator of \u201cBabylon Berlin.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s created a portrait of an era through the lens of genre fiction.\u201d\\r\\nHaving spent a good part of his professional life in the two tumultuous decades between two world wars, the 55-year-old former journalist has found success as Germans have increasingly become fascinated with the era.\\r\\nBy bringing an American-style detective story to Weimar Berlin \u2014 a city Mr. Kutscher calls the most American European city \u2014 he has helped popularize an era that has remained shrouded in Germany because of the monstrosities and guilt of the Nazi era that succeeded it. His novels have become almost essential reading in a German discussion about the creation of the modern democratic state, founded 100 years ago.\\r\\nAnd with the contemporary rise of populist nationalism and the perception that \u2014 despite a booming, culturally blossoming era \u2014 chaos is at the doorstep, the era is one that many Germans recognize as a mirror \u2014 if a warped one \u2014 of their present-day country.\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019m very much against direct comparisons: to say that we live in the Weimar Republic again is not \u2014 luckily \u2014 true,\u201d said Mr. Kutscher, before gamely pointing out the key differences.\\r\\nThe modern German economy is humming, whereas in 1929, the year Mr. Kutscher\u2019s first novel is set, the stock market crash had shaken a nation already traumatized by hyperinflation. The current populists, the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany, who entered Parliament last year for the first time, are not the National Socialists.\\r\\n\u201cBut when I started writing, I would not have thought that we would once more live in a time where democracy is similarly endangered,\u201d he said.\\r\\nDaniel Sch\u00f6npflug, a historian of the era, has praised \u201cBabylon Berlin\u201d for its historical accuracy and for making the era accessible to a wide audience.\\r\\nMr. Kutscher has done this in part by giving his characters modern habits and placing well-known brands in the story.\\r\\n\u201cSome of my characters shower almost every day, which wasn\u2019t normal then, but I wanted them to be relatable,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are just much cleaner than their brethren.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Kutscher admits that part of his success is luck. His works became best sellers at a time when Germans were ready to re-examine the Weimar Republic. Mr. Tykwer, of \u201cBabylon Berlin,\u201d concurs.\\r\\n\u201cWe started writing the script in 2013,\u201d he said, \u201cand it was almost uncanny how the real world around us seemed to want to conform to the era we were describing.\u201d\\r\\nBesides the $45.5 million TV show \u2014 the most expensive ever made in Germany \u2014 the books have spawned radio theater, a comic book, a podcast and walking tours. Mr. Kutscher created one picture book with Kat Menschik, a well-known illustrator, that tells the back story of one of the characters in his world without being part of the detective series.\\r\\nLike his main character, the dogged and ethically compromised police inspector Gereon Rath, Mr. Kutscher is actually not a Berliner, but a longtime resident of Cologne.\\r\\nHe grew up in the 1960s and 1970s in Wipperf\u00fcrth, a small market town in the west of the country, far from the Berlin hustle. After college, where he studied German literature and history, he landed a trainee position at the K\u00f6lnische Rundschau, a regional paper. He was offered a full-time job after graduation, but it came with a catch: He would have to cover his hometown, the very place he was trying to leave.\\r\\n\u201cIt was like being the priest or the mayor, maybe less important, but you were visible and had to be responsible,\u201d he said.\\r\\nMr. Kutscher\u2019s love for Berlin and the Weimar era came through its literature (which because of his novels is experiencing renewed popularity). In the mid-1980s he started regularly visiting the city, going to East Berlin to follow the footsteps of the writers Alfred D\u00f6blin and Erich K\u00e4stner. He draws on his memories of the grayness he experienced there in imagining Berlin in the 1920s, he said.\\r\\n\u201cThe city was much less colorful then,\u201d he said during an extensive interview in a hip hotel in Berlin, right at a spot where a fictional tobacconist introduced Inspector Rath to Camel Cigarettes in 1931.\\r\\nAfter seven years as the local editor of the paper, he quit to focus on his project: a series of books that would document the Weimar Republic and the first years of the Nazi era. Since he had written only three relatively unknown local crime thrillers (a new genre in Germany at the time), finding a publisher to consider such a hefty project took nearly two years. By the time Kiepenheuer & Witsch signed on for the first book \u2014 with options for the following manuscripts \u2014 he had almost given up and was looking for his next job in journalism.\\r\\n\u201cThe goal really was just to be able to do this full-time,\u201d he said. That was assured after his third book, \u201cGoldstein,\u201d came out in 2010 and made it onto the German best-seller list (it\u2019s available as an e-book in the United States from Picador Press, with a paperback to follow next year).\\r\\nHis latest novel, \u201cMarlow,\u201d yet to be translated, is set in the city after the Nazis have come to power. The Vossische Zeitung has closed after a nearly two-century run, while the liberal Berliner Tageblatt, in Jewish hands since its founding in 1872, has been taken over by the Nazis.\\r\\nMr. Kutscher still forces himself to read it, to know what his characters, navigating Berlin in 1935, would have read.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s just awful now,\u201d he said.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1589159170,\"description\":\"With seven hit novels, now the basis of a blockbuster TV show, Volker Kutscher has helped ignite a debate in Germany about whether history is repeating itself.\\r\",\"title\":\"The Saturday Profile: The Man Who Brought Weimar Into Germans\u2019 Living Rooms\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"world.12.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Send questions about the office, money, careers and work-life balance to workfriend@nytimes.com.

I was stunned to find out that he was effectively doubling the cost of each trip by charging for every conceivable cost of maintaining his car \u2014 including depreciation, tires, routine maintenance \u2014 and soon, the cost of a new car.

Is it not something like a key party, but the keys are for the starting of cars? Like gender-reveal parties and premade pie crusts in grocery stores, this is totally baffling to me. Run, quit, emigrate, anything, just get away!\\r\\nA More Serious Question\\r\\nI cannot stand my colleagues. For two years, one has asked me uncomfortable, emotionally manipulative questions that I know purposefully push my boundaries: personal financial questions, extremely personal relationship questions about my boyfriend, asking repeatedly exactly where I live and the route I take to get home. Once, he said he \u201cneeded help watering his plant,\u201d and then came up behind me and pushed me into his desk, which I certainly consider sexual harassment. I would report this, but I know it would destroy my small team and not end well \u2014 not to mention that my other colleagues have made their views on #MeToo clear. \\r\\nI feel stuck. I know only very bad bad uncomfortable things would come of reporting the guy, because the rest of the team would not support me, and it could jeopardize my ability to get a reference from my boss in the future. But I hate working with this guy, and I believe that women should report this stuff. I am planning to move cities in the next year and I don\u2019t want to find another job to fill only a short gap.

I\u2019d be snacking on a muffin and then suddenly I\u2019d be crunching down on a sliver of tooth. I felt more comfortable with the agony I knew and didn\u2019t want to risk something worse.

Then I looked it up, and I was being gaslighted, and then some.\\r\\nI came close to a nervous breakdown, and hid out for long enough that their baby company began to crumble without me.

They say the secret is communication. But communication is the worst! Communication usually involves feelings and telephones, two of the most gross things. The best I could ever do in a business marriage is how I try to do regular love-marriage. If you can truly explain and manage the most important values to your partner that are also alien to you \u2014 whether they\u2019re about privacy, or dignity, or fairness, or money \u2014 then you\u2019re doing the best job possible, even if you\u2019re doing a shabby job otherwise. Partners have to stand together in the face of adversity. If you can\u2019t explain what your partner cares about and why, it\u2019s time to get divorced in the great state of Delaware.

Specifically, something was missing.\\r\\nIt was summer. He was out in the country, moving fast. But strangely, he wasn\u2019t eating any bugs.\\r\\nFor a moment, Riis was transported to his childhood on the Danish island of Lolland, in the Baltic Sea. Back then, summer bike rides meant closing his mouth to cruise through thick clouds of insects, but inevitably he swallowed some anyway. When his parents took him driving, he remembered, the car\u2019s windshield was frequently so smeared with insect carcasses that you almost couldn\u2019t see through it. But all that seemed distant now. He couldn\u2019t recall the last time he needed to wash bugs from his windshield; he even wondered, vaguely, whether car manufacturers had invented some fancy new coating to keep off insects. But this absence, he now realized with some alarm, seemed to be all around him. Where had all those insects gone? And when? And why hadn\u2019t he noticed?\\r\\nRiis watched his son, flying through the beautiful day, not eating bugs, and was struck by the melancholy thought that his son\u2019s childhood would lack this particular bug-eating experience of his own. It was, he granted, an odd thing to feel nostalgic about. But he couldn\u2019t shake a feeling of loss. \u201cI guess it\u2019s pretty human to think that everything was better when you were a kid,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe I didn\u2019t like it when I was on my bike and I ate all the bugs, but looking back on it, I think it\u2019s something everybody should experience.\u201d\\r\\nI met Riis, a lanky high school science and math teacher, on a hot day in June. He was anxious about not having yet written his address for the school\u2019s graduation ceremony that evening, but first, he had a job to do. From his garage, he retrieved a large insect net, drove to a nearby intersection and stopped to strap the net to the car\u2019s roof. Made of white mesh, the net ran the length of his car and was held up by a tent pole at the front, tapering to a small, removable bag in back. Drivers whizzing past twisted their heads to stare. Riis eyed his parking spot nervously as he adjusted the straps of the contraption. \u201cThis is not 100 percent legal,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I guess, for the sake of science.\u201d\\r\\nRiis had not been able to stop thinking about the missing bugs. The more he learned, the more his nostalgia gave way to worry. Insects are the vital pollinators and recyclers of ecosystems and the base of food webs everywhere. Riis was not alone in noticing their decline. In the United States, scientists recently found the population of monarch butterflies fell by 90 percent in the last 20 years, a loss of 900 million individuals; the rusty-patched bumblebee, which once lived in 28 states, dropped by 87 percent over the same period. With other, less-studied insect species, one butterfly researcher told me, \u201call we can do is wave our arms and say, \u2018It\u2019s not here anymore!\u2019\u2009\u201d Still, the most disquieting thing wasn\u2019t the disappearance of certain species of insects; it was the deeper worry, shared by Riis and many others, that a whole insect world might be quietly going missing, a loss of abundance that could alter the planet in unknowable ways. \u201cWe notice the losses,\u201d says David Wagner, an entomologist at the University of Connecticut. \u201cIt\u2019s the diminishment that we don\u2019t see.\u201d\\r\\nBecause insects are legion, inconspicuous and hard to meaningfully track, the fear that there might be far fewer than before was more felt than documented. People noticed it by canals or in backyards or under streetlights at night \u2014 familiar places that had become unfamiliarly empty. The feeling was so common that entomologists developed a shorthand for it, named for the way many people first began to notice that they weren\u2019t seeing as many bugs. They called it the windshield phenomenon.\\r\\nTo test what had been primarily a loose suspicion of wrongness, Riis and 200 other Danes were spending the month of June roaming their country\u2019s back roads in their outfitted cars. They were part of a study conducted by the Natural History Museum of Denmark, a joint effort of the University of Copenhagen, Aarhus University and North Carolina State University. The nets would stand in for windshields as Riis and the other volunteers drove through various habitats \u2014 urban areas, forests, agricultural tracts, uncultivated open land and wetlands \u2014 hoping to quantify the disorienting sense that, as one of the study\u2019s designers put it, \u201csomething from the past is missing from the present.\u201d\\r\\nWhen the investigators began planning the study in 2016, they weren\u2019t sure if anyone would sign up. But by the time the nets were ready, a paper by an obscure German entomological society had brought the problem of insect decline into sharp focus. The German study found that, measured simply by weight, the overall abundance of flying insects in German nature reserves had decreased by 75 percent over just 27 years. If you looked at midsummer population peaks, the drop was 82 percent.\\r\\nRiis learned about the study from a group of his students in one of their class projects. They must have made some kind of mistake in their citation, he thought. But they hadn\u2019t. The study would quickly become, according to the website Altmetric, the sixth-most-discussed scientific paper of 2017. Headlines around the world warned of an \u201cinsect Armageddon.\u201d\\r\\nWithin days of announcing the insect-collection project, the Natural History Museum of Denmark was turning away eager volunteers by the dozens. It seemed there were people like Riis everywhere, people who had noticed a change but didn\u2019t know what to make of it. How could something as fundamental as the bugs in the sky just disappear? And what would become of the world without them?\\r\\nAnyone who has returned to a childhood haunt to find that everything somehow got smaller knows that humans are not great at remembering the past accurately. This is especially true when it comes to changes to the natural world. It is impossible to maintain a fixed perspective, as Heraclitus observed 2,500 years ago: It is not the same river, but we are also not the same people.\\r\\nA 1995 study, by Peter H. Kahn and Batya Friedman, of the way some children in Houston experienced pollution summed up our blindness this way: \u201cWith each generation, the amount of environmental degradation increases, but each generation takes that amount as the norm.\u201d In decades of photos of fishermen holding up their catch in the Florida Keys, the marine biologist Loren McClenachan found a perfect illustration of this phenomenon, which is often called \u201cshifting baseline syndrome.\u201d The fish got smaller and smaller, to the point where the prize catches were dwarfed by fish that in years past were piled up and ignored. But the smiles on the fishermen\u2019s faces stayed the same size. The world never feels fallen, because we grow accustomed to the fall.\\r\\nBy one measure, bugs are the wildlife we know best, the nondomesticated animals whose lives intersect most intimately with our own: spiders in the shower, ants at the picnic, ticks buried in the skin. We sometimes feel that we know them rather too well. In another sense, though, they are one of our planet\u2019s greatest mysteries, a reminder of how little we know about what\u2019s happening in the world around us.\\r\\nWe\u2019ve named and described a million species of insects, a stupefying array of thrips and firebrats and antlions and caddis flies and froghoppers and other enormous families of bugs that most of us can\u2019t even name. (Technically, the word \u201cbug\u201d applies only to the order Hemiptera, also known as true bugs, species that have tubelike mouths for piercing and sucking \u2014 and there are as many as 80,000 named varieties of those.) The ones we think we do know well, we don\u2019t: There are 12,000 types of ants, nearly 20,000 varieties of bees, almost 400,000 species of beetles, so many that the geneticist J.B.S. Haldane reportedly quipped that God must have an inordinate fondness for them. A bit of healthy soil a foot square and two inches deep might easily be home to 200 unique species of mites, each, presumably, with a subtly different job to do. And yet entomologists estimate that all this amazing, absurd and understudied variety represents perhaps only 20 percent of the actual diversity of insects on our planet \u2014 that there are millions and millions of species that are entirely unknown to science.\\r\\nWith so much abundance, it very likely never occurred to most entomologists of the past that their multitudinous subjects might dwindle away. As they poured themselves into studies of the life cycles and taxonomies of the species that fascinated them, few thought to measure or record something as boring as their number. Besides, tracking quantity is slow, tedious and unglamorous work: setting and checking traps, waiting years or decades for your data to be meaningful, grappling with blunt baseline questions instead of more sophisticated ones. And who would pay for it? Most academic funding is short-term, but when what you\u2019re interested in is invisible, generational change, says Dave Goulson, an entomologist at the University of Sussex, \u201ca three-year monitoring program is no good to anybody.\u201d This is especially true of insect populations, which are naturally variable, with wide, trend-obscuring fluctuations from one year to the next.\\r\\nWhen entomologists began noticing and investigating insect declines, they lamented the absence of solid information from the past in which to ground their experiences of the present. \u201cWe see a hundred of something, and we think we\u2019re fine,\u201d Wagner says, \u201cbut what if there were 100,000 two generations ago?\u201d Rob Dunn, an ecologist at North Carolina State University who helped design the net experiment in Denmark, recently searched for studies showing the effect of pesticide spraying on the quantity of insects living in nearby forests. He was surprised to find that no such studies existed. \u201cWe ignored really basic questions,\u201d he said. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019ve dropped the ball in some giant collective way.\u201d\\r\\nIf entomologists lacked data, what they did have were some very worrying clues. Along with the impression that they were seeing fewer bugs in their own jars and nets while out doing experiments \u2014 a windshield phenomenon specific to the sorts of people who have bug jars and nets \u2014 there were documented downward slides of well-studied bugs, including various kinds of bees, moths, butterflies and beetles. In Britain, as many as 30 to 60 percent of species were found to have diminishing ranges. Larger trends were harder to pin down, though a 2014 review in Science tried to quantify these declines by synthesizing the findings of existing studies and found that a majority of monitored species were declining, on average by 45 percent.\\r\\nEntomologists also knew that climate change and the overall degradation of global habitat are bad news for biodiversity in general, and that insects are dealing with the particular challenges posed by herbicides and pesticides, along with the effects of losing meadows, forests and even weedy patches to the relentless expansion of human spaces. There were studies of other, better-understood species that suggested that the insects associated with them might be declining, too. People who studied fish found that the fish had fewer mayflies to eat. Ornithologists kept finding that birds that rely on insects for food were in trouble: eight in 10 partridges gone from French farmlands; 50 and 80 percent drops, respectively, for nightingales and turtledoves. Half of all farmland birds in Europe disappeared in just three decades. At first, many scientists assumed the familiar culprit of habitat destruction was at work, but then they began to wonder if the birds might simply be starving. In Denmark, an ornithologist named Anders Tottrup was the one who came up with the idea of turning cars into insect trackers for the windshield-effect study after he noticed that rollers, little owls, Eurasian hobbies and bee-eaters \u2014 all birds that subsist on large insects such as beetles and dragonflies \u2014 had abruptly disappeared from the landscape.\\r\\nThe signs were certainly alarming, but they were also just signs, not enough to justify grand pronouncements about the health of insects as a whole or about what might be driving a widespread, cross-species decline. \u201cThere are no quantitative data on insects, so this is just a hypothesis,\u201d Hans de Kroon, an ecologist at Radboud University in the Netherlands, explained to me \u2014 not the sort of language that sends people to the barricades.\\r\\nThen came the German study. Scientists are still cautious about what the findings might imply about other regions of the world. But the study brought forth exactly the kind of longitudinal data they had been seeking, and it wasn\u2019t specific to just one type of insect. The numbers were stark, indicating a vast impoverishment of an entire insect universe, even in protected areas where insects ought to be under less stress. The speed and scale of the drop were shocking even to entomologists who were already anxious about bees or fireflies or the cleanliness of car windshields.\\r\\nThe results were surprising in another way too. The long-term details about insect abundance, the kind that no one really thought existed, hadn\u2019t appeared in a particularly prestigious journal and didn\u2019t come from university-affiliated scientists, but from a small society of insect enthusiasts based in the modest German city Krefeld.\\r\\nKrefeld sits a half-hour drive outside D\u00fcsseldorf, near the western bank of the Rhine. It\u2019s a city of brick houses and bright flower gardens and a stadtwald \u2014 a municipal forest and park \u2014 where paddle boats float on a lake, umbrellas shade a beer garden and (I couldn\u2019t help noticing) the afternoon light through the trees illuminates small swarms of dancing insects.\\r\\nNear the center of the old city, a paper sign, not much larger than a business card, identifies the stolid headquarters of the society whose research caused so much commotion. When it was founded, in 1905, the society operated out of another building, one that was destroyed when Britain bombed the city during World War II. (By the time the bombs fell, members had moved their precious records and collections of insects, some of which dated back to the 1860s, to an underground bunker.) Nowadays, the society uses more than 6,000 square feet of an old three-story school as storage space. Ask for a tour of the collections, and you will hear such sentences as \u201cThis whole room is Lepidoptera,\u201d referring to a former classroom stuffed with what I at first took to be shelves of books but which are in fact innumerable wooden frames containing pinned butterflies and moths; and, in an even larger room, \u201cevery bumblebee here was collected before the Second World War, 1880 to 1930\u201d; and, upon opening a drawer full of sweat bees, \u201cIt\u2019s a new collection, 30 years only.\u201d\\r\\nOn the shelves that do hold books, I counted 31 clearly well-loved volumes in the series \u201cBeetles of Middle Europe.\u201d A 395-page book that cataloged specimens of spider wasps \u2014 where they were collected; where they were stored \u2014 of the western Palearctic said \u201c1948-2008\u201d on the cover. I asked my guide, a society member named Martin Sorg, who was one of the lead authors of the paper, whether those dates reflected when the specimens were collected. \u201cNo,\u201d Sorg replied, \u201cthat was the time the author needed for this work.\u201d\\r\\nSorg, who rolls his own cigarettes and wears John Lennon glasses and whose gray hair grows long past his shoulders, is not a freewheeling type when it comes to his insect work. And his insect work is really all he wants to talk about. \u201cWe think details about nature and biodiversity declines are important, not details about life histories of entomologists,\u201d Sorg explained after he and Werner Stenmans, a society member whose name appeared alongside Sorg\u2019s on the 2017 paper, dismissed my questions about their day jobs. Leery of an article that focused on him as a person, Sorg also didn\u2019t want to talk about what drew him to entomology as a child or even what it was about certain types of wasps that had made him want to devote so much of his life to studying them. \u201cWe normally give life histories when someone is dead,\u201d he said.\\r\\nThere was a reason for the wariness. Society members dislike seeing themselves described, over and over in news stories, as \u201camateurs.\u201d It\u2019s a framing that reflects, they believe, a too-narrow understanding of what it means to be an expert or even a scientist \u2014 what it means to be a student of the natural world.\\r\\nAmateurs have long provided much of the patchy knowledge we have about nature. Those bee and butterfly studies? Most depend on mass mobilizations of volunteers willing to walk transects and count insects, every two weeks or every year, year after year. The scary numbers about bird declines were gathered this way, too, though because birds can be hard to spot, volunteers often must learn to identify them by their sounds. Britain, which has a particularly strong tradition of amateur naturalism, has the best-studied bugs in the world. As technologically advanced as we are, the natural world is still a very big and complex place, and the best way to learn what\u2019s going on is for a lot of people to spend a lot of time observing it. The Latin root of the word \u201camateur\u201d is, after all, the word \u201clover.\u201d\\r\\nSome of these citizen-scientists are true beginners clutching field guides; others, driven by their own passion and following in a long tradition of \u201camateur\u201d naturalism, are far from novices. Think of Victorians with their butterfly nets and curiosity cabinets; of Vladimir Nabokov, whose theories about the evolution of Polyommatus blue butterflies were ignored until proved correct by DNA testing more than 30 years after his death; of young Charles Darwin, cutting his classes at Cambridge to collect beetles at Wicken Fen and once putting a live beetle in his mouth because his hands were already full of other bugs.\\r\\nThe Krefeld society is volunteer-run, and many members have other jobs in unrelated fields, but they also have an enormous depth of knowledge about insects, accumulated through years of what other people might consider obsessive attention. Some study the ecology or evolutionary taxonomy of their favorite species or map their populations or breed them to study their life histories. All hone their identification skills across species by amassing their own collections of carefully pinned and labeled insects like those that fill the society\u2019s storage rooms. Sorg estimated that of the society\u2019s 63 members, a third are university-trained in subjects such as biology or earth science. Another third, he said, are \u201chighly specialized and highly qualified but they never visited the university,\u201d while the remaining third are actual amateurs who are still in the process of becoming \u201creal\u201d entomologists: \u201cSome of them may also have a degree from the university, but in our view, they are beginners.\u201d\\r\\nThe society members\u2019 projects often involved setting up what are called malaise traps, nets that look like tents and drive insects flying by into bottles of ethanol. Because of the scientific standards of the society, members followed certain procedures: They always employed identical traps, sewn from a template they first used in 1982. (Sorg showed me the original rolled-up craft paper with great solemnity.) They always put them in the same places. (Before GPS, that meant a painstaking process of triangulating with surveying equipment. \u201cWe are not sure about a few centimeters,\u201d Sorg granted.) They saved everything they caught, regardless of what the main purpose of the experiment was. (The society bought so much ethanol that it attracted the attention of a narcotics unit.)\\r\\nThose bottles of insects were gathered into thousands of boxes, which are now crammed into what were once offices in the upper reaches of the school. When the society members, like entomologists elsewhere, began to notice that they were seeing fewer insects, they had something against which to measure their worries.\\r\\n\u201cWe don\u2019t throw away anything, we store everything,\u201d Sorg explained. \u201cThat gives us today the possibility to go back in time.\u201d\\r\\nIn 2013, Krefeld entomologists confirmed that the total number of insects caught in one nature reserve was nearly 80 percent lower than the same spot in 1989. They had sampled other sites, analyzed old data sets and found similar declines: Where 30 years earlier, they often needed a liter bottle for a week of trapping, now a half-liter bottle usually sufficed. But it would have taken even highly trained entomologists years of painstaking work to identify all the insects in the bottles. So the society used a standardized method for weighing insects in alcohol, which told a powerful story simply by showing how much the overall mass of insects dropped over time. \u201cA decline of this mixture,\u201d Sorg said, \u201cis a very different thing than the decline of only a few species.\u201d\\r\\nThe society collaborated with de Kroon and other scientists at Radboud University in the Netherlands, who did a trend analysis of the data that Krefeld provided, controlling for things like the effects of nearby plants, weather and forest cover on fluctuations in insect populations. The final study looked at 63 nature preserves, representing almost 17,000 sampling days, and found consistent declines in every kind of habitat they sampled. This suggested, the authors wrote, \u201cthat it is not only the vulnerable species but the flying-insect community as a whole that has been decimated over the last few decades.\u201d\\r\\nFor some scientists, the study created a moment of reckoning. \u201cScientists thought this data was too boring,\u201d Dunn says. \u201cBut these people found it beautiful, and they loved it. They were the ones paying attention to Earth for all the rest of us.\u201d\\r\\nThe current worldwide loss of biodiversity is popularly known as the sixth extinction: the sixth time in world history that a large number of species have disappeared in unusually rapid succession, caused this time not by asteroids or ice ages but by humans. When we think about losing biodiversity, we tend to think of the last northern white rhinos protected by armed guards, of polar bears on dwindling ice floes. Extinction is a visceral tragedy, universally understood: There is no coming back from it. The guilt of letting a unique species vanish is eternal.\\r\\nBut extinction is not the only tragedy through which we\u2019re living. What about the species that still exist, but as a shadow of what they once were? In \u201cThe Once and Future World,\u201d the journalist J.B. MacKinnon cites records from recent centuries that hint at what has only just been lost: \u201cIn the North Atlantic, a school of cod stalls a tall ship in midocean; off Sydney, Australia, a ship\u2019s captain sails from noon until sunset through pods of sperm whales as far as the eye can see. ... Pacific pioneers complain to the authorities that splashing salmon threaten to swamp their canoes.\u201d There were reports of lions in the south of France, walruses at the mouth of the Thames, flocks of birds that took three days to fly overhead, as many as 100 blue whales in the Southern Ocean for every one that\u2019s there now. \u201cThese are not sights from some ancient age of fire and ice,\u201d MacKinnon writes. \u201cWe are talking about things seen by human eyes, recalled in human memory.\u201d\\r\\nWhat we\u2019re losing is not just the diversity part of biodiversity, but the bio part: life in sheer quantity. While I was writing this article, scientists learned that the world\u2019s largest king penguin colony shrank by 88 percent in 35 years, that more than 97 percent of the bluefin tuna that once lived in the ocean are gone. The number of Sophie the Giraffe toys sold in France in a single year is nine times the number of all the giraffes that still live in Africa.\\r\\nFinding reassurance in the survival of a few symbolic standard-bearers ignores the value of abundance, of a natural world that thrives on richness and complexity and interaction. Tigers still exist, for example, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that 93 percent of the land where they used to live is now tigerless. This matters for more than romantic reasons: Large animals, especially top predators like tigers, connect ecosystems to one another and move energy and resources among them simply by walking and eating and defecating and dying. (In the deep ocean, sunken whale carcasses form the basis of entire ecosystems in nutrient-poor places.) One result of their loss is what\u2019s known as trophic cascade, the unraveling of an ecosystem\u2019s fabric as prey populations boom and crash and the various levels of the food web no longer keep each other in check. These places are emptier, impoverished in a thousand subtle ways.\\r\\nScientists have begun to speak of functional extinction (as opposed to the more familiar kind, numerical extinction). Functionally extinct animals and plants are still present but no longer prevalent enough to affect how an ecosystem works. Some phrase this as the extinction not of a species but of all its former interactions with its environment \u2014 an extinction of seed dispersal and predation and pollination and all the other ecological functions an animal once had, which can be devastating even if some individuals still persist. The more interactions are lost, the more disordered the ecosystem becomes. A 2013 paper in Nature, which modeled both natural and computer-generated food webs, suggested that a loss of even 30 percent of a species\u2019 abundance can be so destabilizing that other species start going fully, numerically extinct \u2014 in fact, 80 percent of the time it was a secondarily affected creature that was the first to disappear. A famous real-world example of this type of cascade concerns sea otters. When they were nearly wiped out in the northern Pacific, their prey, sea urchins, ballooned in number and decimated kelp forests, turning a rich environment into a barren one and also possibly contributing to numerical extinctions, notably of the Steller\u2019s sea cow.\\r\\nConservationists tend to focus on rare and endangered species, but it is common ones, because of their abundance, that power the living systems of our planet. Most species are not common, but within many animal groups most individuals \u2014 some 80 percent of them \u2014 belong to common species. Like the slow approach of twilight, their declines can be hard to see. White-rumped vultures were nearly gone from India before there was widespread awareness of their disappearance. Describing this phenomenon in the journal BioScience, Kevin Gaston, a professor of biodiversity and conservation at the University of Exeter, wrote: \u201cHumans seem innately better able to detect the complete loss of an environmental feature than its progressive change.\u201d\\r\\nIn addition to extinction (the complete loss of a species) and extirpation (a localized extinction), scientists now speak of defaunation: the loss of individuals, the loss of abundance, the loss of a place\u2019s absolute animalness. In a 2014 article in Science, researchers argued that the word should become as familiar, and influential, as the concept of deforestation. In 2017 another paper reported that major population and range losses extended even to species considered to be at low risk for extinction. They predicted \u201cnegative cascading consequences on ecosystem functioning and services vital to sustaining civilization\u201d and the authors offered another term for the widespread loss of the world\u2019s wild fauna: \u201cbiological annihilation.\u201d\\r\\nIt is estimated that, since 1970, Earth\u2019s various populations of wild land animals have lost, on average, 60 percent of their members. Zeroing in on the category we most relate to, mammals, scientists believe that for every six wild creatures that once ate and burrowed and raised young, only one remains. What we have instead is ourselves. A study published this year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that if you look at the world\u2019s mammals by weight, 96 percent of that biomass is humans and livestock; just 4 percent is wild animals.\\r\\nWe\u2019ve begun to talk about living in the Anthropocene, a world shaped by humans. But E.O. Wilson, the naturalist and prophet of environmental degradation, has suggested another name: the Eremocine, the age of loneliness.\\r\\nWilson began his career as a taxonomic entomologist, studying ants. Insects \u2014 about as far as you can get from charismatic megafauna \u2014 are not what we\u2019re usually imagining when we talk about biodiversity. Yet they are, in Wilson\u2019s words, \u201cthe little things that run the natural world.\u201d He means it literally. Insects are a case study in the invisible importance of the common.\\r\\nScientists have tried to calculate the benefits that insects provide simply by going about their business in large numbers. Trillions of bugs flitting from flower to flower pollinate some three-quarters of our food crops, a service worth as much as $500 billion every year. (This doesn\u2019t count the 80 percent of wild flowering plants, the foundation blocks of life everywhere, that rely on insects for pollination.) If monetary calculations like that sound strange, consider the Maoxian Valley in China, where shortages of insect pollinators have led farmers to hire human workers, at a cost of up to $19 per worker per day, to replace bees. Each person covers five to 10 trees a day, pollinating apple blossoms by hand.\\r\\nBy eating and being eaten, insects turn plants into protein and power the growth of all the uncountable species \u2014 including freshwater fish and a majority of birds \u2014 that rely on them for food, not to mention all the creatures that eat those creatures. We worry about saving the grizzly bear, says the insect ecologist Scott Hoffman Black, but where is the grizzly without the bee that pollinates the berries it eats or the flies that sustain baby salmon? Where, for that matter, are we?\\r\\nBugs are vital to the decomposition that keeps nutrients cycling, soil healthy, plants growing and ecosystems running. This role is mostly invisible, until suddenly it\u2019s not. After introducing cattle to Australia at the turn of the 19th century, settlers soon found themselves overwhelmed by the problem of their feces: For some reason, cow pies there were taking months or even years to decompose. Cows refused to eat near the stink, requiring more and more land for grazing, and so many flies bred in the piles that the country became famous for the funny hats that stockmen wore to keep them at bay. It wasn\u2019t until 1951 that a visiting entomologist realized what was wrong: The local insects, evolved to eat the more fibrous waste of marsupials, couldn\u2019t handle cow excrement. For the next 25 years, the importation, quarantine and release of dozens of species of dung beetles became a national priority. And that was just one unfilled niche. (In the United States, dung beetles save ranchers an estimated $380 million a year.) We simply don\u2019t know everything that insects do. Only about 2 percent of invertebrate species have been studied enough for us to estimate whether they are in danger of extinction, never mind what dangers that extinction might pose.\\r\\nWhen asked to imagine what would happen if insects were to disappear completely, scientists find words like chaos, collapse, Armageddon. Wagner, the University of Connecticut entomologist, describes a flowerless world with silent forests, a world of dung and old leaves and rotting carcasses accumulating in cities and roadsides, a world of \u201ccollapse or decay and erosion and loss that would spread through ecosystems\u201d \u2014 spiraling from predators to plants. E.O. Wilson has written of an insect-free world, a place where most plants and land animals become extinct; where fungi explodes, for a while, thriving on death and rot; and where \u201cthe human species survives, able to fall back on wind-pollinated grains and marine fishing\u201d despite mass starvation and resource wars. \u201cClinging to survival in a devastated world, and trapped in an ecological dark age,\u201d he adds, \u201cthe survivors would offer prayers for the return of weeds and bugs.\u201d\\r\\nBut the crux of the windshield phenomenon, the reason that the creeping suspicion of change is so creepy, is that insects wouldn\u2019t have to disappear altogether for us to find ourselves missing them for reasons far beyond nostalgia. In October, an entomologist sent me an email with the subject line, \u201cHoly [expletive]!\u201d and an attachment: a study just out from Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that he labeled, \u201cKrefeld comes to Puerto Rico.\u201d The study included data from the 1970s and from the early 2010s, when a tropical ecologist named Brad Lister returned to the rain forest where he had studied lizards \u2014 and, crucially, their prey \u2014 40 years earlier. Lister set out sticky traps and swept nets across foliage in the same places he had in the 1970s, but this time he and his co-author, Andres Garcia, caught much, much less: 10 to 60 times less arthropod biomass than before. (It\u2019s easy to read that number as 60 percent less, but it\u2019s sixtyfold less: Where once he caught 473 milligrams of bugs, Lister was now catching just eight milligrams.) \u201cIt was, you know, devastating,\u201d Lister told me. But even scarier were the ways the losses were already moving through the ecosystem, with serious declines in the numbers of lizards, birds and frogs. The paper reported \u201ca bottom-up trophic cascade and consequent collapse of the forest food web.\u201d Lister\u2019s inbox quickly filled with messages from other scientists, especially people who study soil invertebrates, telling him they were seeing similarly frightening declines. Even after his dire findings, Lister found the losses shocking: \u201cI didn\u2019t even know about the earthworm crisis!\u201d\\r\\nThe strange thing, Lister said, is that, as staggering as they are, all the declines he documented would still be basically invisible to the average person walking through the Luquillo rain forest. On his last visit, the forest still felt \u201ctimeless\u201d and \u201cphantasmagorical,\u201d with \u201ccascading waterfalls and carpets of flowers.\u201d You would have to be an expert to notice what was missing. But he expects the losses to push the forest toward a tipping point, after which \u201cthere is a sudden and dramatic loss of the rain-forest system,\u201d and the changes will become obvious to anyone. The place he loves will become unrecognizable.\\r\\nThe insects in the forest that Lister studied haven\u2019t been contending with pesticides or habitat loss, the two problems to which the Krefeld paper pointed. Instead, Lister chalks up their decline to climate change, which has already increased temperatures in Luquillo by two degrees Celsius since Lister first sampled there. Previous research suggested that tropical bugs will be unusually sensitive to temperature changes; in November, scientists who subjected laboratory beetles to a heat wave reported that the increased temperatures made them significantly less fertile. Other scientists wonder if it might be climate-induced drought or possibly invasive rats or simply \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts\u201d \u2014 a confluence of many kinds of changes to the places where insects once thrived.\\r\\nLike other species, insects are responding to what Chris Thomas, an insect ecologist at the University of York, has called \u201cthe transformation of the world\u201d: not just a changing climate but also the widespread conversion, via urbanization, agricultural intensification and so on, of natural spaces into human ones, with fewer and fewer resources \u201cleft over\u201d for nonhuman creatures to live on. What resources remain are often contaminated. Hans de Kroon characterizes the life of many modern insects as trying to survive from one dwindling oasis to the next but with \u201ca desert in between, and at worst it\u2019s a poisonous desert.\u201d Of particular concern are neonicotinoids, neurotoxins that were thought to affect only treated crops but turned out to accumulate in the landscape and to be consumed by all kinds of nontargeted bugs. People talk about the \u201closs\u201d of bees to colony collapse disorder, and that appears to be the right word: Affected hives aren\u2019t full of dead bees, but simply mysteriously empty. A leading theory is that exposure to neurotoxins leaves bees unable to find their way home. Even hives exposed to low levels of neonicotinoids have been shown to collect less pollen and produce fewer eggs and far fewer queens. Some recent studies found bees doing better in cities than in the supposed countryside.\\r\\nThe diversity of insects means that some will manage to make do in new environments, some will thrive (abundance cuts both ways: agricultural monocultures, places where only one kind of plant grows, allow some pests to reach population levels they would never achieve in nature) and some, searching for food and shelter in a world nothing like the one they were meant for, will fail. While we need much more data to better understand the reasons or mechanisms behind the ups and downs, Thomas says, \u201cthe average across all species is still a decline.\u201d\\r\\nSince the Krefeld study came out, researchers have begun searching for other forgotten repositories of information that might offer windows into the past. Some of the Radboud researchers have analyzed long-term data, belonging to Dutch entomological societies, about beetles and moths in certain reserves; they found significant drops (72 percent, 54 percent) that mirrored the Krefeld ones. Roel van Klink, a researcher at the German Center for Integrative Biodiversity Research, told me that before Krefeld, he, like most entomologists, had never been interested in biomass. Now he is looking for historical data sets \u2014 many of which began as studies of agricultural pests, like a decades-long study of grasshoppers in Kansas \u2014 that could help create a more thorough picture of what\u2019s happening to creatures that are at once abundant and imperiled. So far he has found forgotten data from 140 old data sets for 1,500 locations that could be resampled.\\r\\nIn the United States, one of the few long-term data sets about insect abundance comes from the work of Arthur Shapiro, an entomologist at the University of California, Davis. In 1972, he began walking transects in the Central Valley and the Sierras, counting butterflies. He planned to do a study on how short-term weather variations affected butterfly populations. But the longer he sampled, the more valuable his data became, offering a signal through the noise of seasonal ups and downs. \u201cAnd so here I am in Year 46,\u201d he said, nearly half a century of spending five days a week, from late spring to the end of autumn, observing butterflies. In that time he has watched overall numbers decline and seen some species that used to be everywhere \u2014 even species that \u201ceveryone regarded as a junk species\u201d only a few decades ago \u2014 all but disappear. Shapiro believes that Krefeld-level declines are likely to be happening all over the globe. \u201cBut, of course, I don\u2019t cover the entire globe,\u201d he added. \u201cI cover I-80.\u201d\\r\\nThere are also new efforts to set up more of the kind of insect-monitoring schemes researchers wish had existed decades ago, so that our current level of fallenness, at least, is captured. One is a pilot project in Germany similar to the Danish car study. To analyze what is caught, the researchers turned to volunteer naturalists, hobbyists similar to the ones in Krefeld, with the necessary breadth of knowledge to know what they\u2019re looking at. \u201cThese are not easy species to identify,\u201d says Aletta Bonn, of the German Center for Integrative Biodiversity Research, who is overseeing the project. (The skills required for such work \u201care really extreme,\u201d Dunn says. \u201cThese people train for decades with other amateurs to be able to identify beetles based on their genitalia.\u201d) Bond would like to pay the volunteers for their expertise, she says, but funding hasn\u2019t caught up to the crisis. That didn\u2019t stop the \u201camateurs\u201d from being willing to help: \u201cThey said, \u2018We\u2019re just curious what\u2019s in there, we would like to have samples.\u2019\u2009\u201d\\r\\nGoulson says that Europe\u2019s tradition of amateur naturalism may account for why so many of the clues to the falloff in insect biodiversity originate there. (Tottrup\u2019s design for the car net in Denmark, for example, was itself adapted from the invention of a dedicated beetle-collecting hobbyist.) As little as we know about the status of European bugs, we know significantly less about other parts of the world. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t know anything if it weren\u2019t for them,\u201d the so-called amateurs, Goulson told me. \u201cWe\u2019d be entirely relying on the fact that there\u2019s no bugs on the windshield.\u201d\\r\\nThomas believes that this naturalist tradition is also why Europe is acting much faster than other places \u2014 for example, the United States \u2014 to address the decline of insects: Interest leads to tracking, which leads to awareness, which leads to concern, which leads to action. Since the Krefeld data emerged, there have been hearings about protecting insect biodiversity in the German Bundestag and the European Parliament. European Union member states voted to extend a ban on neonicotinoid pesticides and have begun to put money toward further studies of how abundance is changing, what is causing those changes and what can be done. When I knocked on the door of de Kroon\u2019s office, at Radboud University in the Dutch city Nijmegen, he was looking at some photos from another meeting he had that day: Willem-Alexander, the king of the Netherlands, had taken a tour of the city\u2019s efforts to make its riverside a friendlier habitat for bugs.\\r\\nStemming insect declines will require much more than this, however. The European Union already had some measures in place to help pollinators \u2014 including more strictly regulating pesticides than the United States does and paying farmers to create insect habitats by leaving fields fallow and allowing for wild edges alongside cultivation \u2014 but insect populations dropped anyway. New reports call for national governments to collaborate; for more creative approaches such as integrating insect habitats into the design of roads, power lines, railroads and other infrastructure; and, as always, for more studies. The necessary changes, like the causes, may be profound. \u201cIt\u2019s just another indication that we\u2019re destroying the life-support system of the planet,\u201d Lister says of the Puerto Rico study. \u201cNature\u2019s resilient, but we\u2019re pushing her to such extremes that eventually it will cause a collapse of the system.\u201d\\r\\nScientists hope that insects will have a chance to embody that resilience. While tigers tend to give birth to three or four cubs at a time, a ghost moth in Australia was once recorded laying 29,100 eggs, and she still had 15,000 in her ovaries. The fecund abundance that is insects\u2019 singular trait should enable them to recover, but only if they are given the space and the opportunity to do so.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s a debate we need to have urgently,\u201d Goulson says. \u201cIf we lose insects, life on earth will. ...\u201d He trailed off, pausing for what felt like a long time.\\r\\nIn Denmark, Sune Boye Riis\u2019s transect with his car net took him past a bit of woods, some suburban lawns, some hedges, a Christmas-tree farm. The closest thing to a meadow that we passed was a large military property, on which the grass had been allowed to grow tall and golden. Riis had received instructions not to drive too fast, so traffic backed up behind us, and some people began to honk. \u201cWell,\u201d Riis said, \u201cso much for science.\u201d After three miles, he turned around and drove back toward the start. His windshield stayed mockingly clean.\\r\\nRiis had four friends who were also participating in the study. They had a bet going among them: Who would net the biggest bug? \u201cI\u2019m way behind,\u201d Riis said. \u201cA bumblebee is in the lead.\u201d His biggest catch? \u201cA fly. Not even a big one.\u201d\\r\\nAt the end of the transect, Riis stopped at another parlous roadside spot, unfastened the net and removed the small bag at its tip. Some volunteers, captivated by what the study revealed about the world around them, asked the organizers for extra specimen bags, so they could do more sampling on their own. Some even asked if they could buy the entire car-net apparatus. Riis, though, was content to peer through the mesh, inside of which he could make out a number of black specks of varying tininess.\\r\\nThere was also a single butterfly, white-winged and delicate. Riis thought of the bet with his friends, for which the meaning of bigness had not been defined. He wondered how it might be reckoned. What gave a creature value?\\r\\n\u201cIs it weight?\u201d he asked, staring down at the butterfly. In the big bag, it looked small and sad and alone. \u201cOr is it grace?\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":828589321,\"description\":\"What does it mean for the rest of life on Earth?\\r\",\"title\":\"Feature: The Insect Apocalypse Is Here\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.27.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"NAYPYIDAW, Myanmar \u2014 In the colossal museum built by Myanmar\u2019s military to honor itself, the general barred from Facebook has his face up everywhere.\\r\\nHis portrait graces the cavernous entrance hall of the museum, with its soaring ceilings and marble floors. In an exhibition recounting Myanmar\u2019s martial history, his photo is at the top of a pyramid of 32 framed shots of other military leaders.\\r\\nIn other halls, his image hangs alone.\\r\\nFor years, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, one of the most powerful people in Myanmar, presided over ruthless campaigns targeting minority groups along Myanmar\u2019s borders.\\r\\nUnder his charge, the military drove out more than 700,000 Rohingya from the country\u2019s west.\\r\\nAn important part of the campaign against the Rohingya was waged on Facebook, and the general, along with other military leaders, used troll farms and fake accounts to seed ethnic hatred and build support for what the United Nations has called \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201d\\r\\nNow, though, the general has been driven off Facebook; the company shut down his accounts in August.\\r\\nYet the museum remains \u2014 a kind of Facebook profile for his accomplishments, and those of the military.\\r\\n\u201cI think the military wanted to build this massive museum to show off its guardianship of the country,\u201d said U Ye Myo Hein, an executive director at the Tagaung Institute of Political Studies in Yangon, Myanmar\u2019s largest city. \u201cBut it\u2019s also a sign of their megalomania.\u201d\\r\\nThe museum sits in the country\u2019s capital, Naypyidaw, itself an even larger show of the military\u2019s long legacy of almost unlimited power in the country.\\r\\nBuilt from scratch in the early 2000s when the military junta held full power, the city was carved out of an expanse of scrubland nestled between two mountain ranges in the center of the country.\\r\\nIn 2005, with little warning, the military announced that the artificial city would become the country\u2019s new capital, even though it was still a construction site. Bureaucrats dutifully picked up and relocated to a half-complete city that lacked basic amenities.\\r\\nSome have theorized that the new city was created as a safeguard against invasion, and also protests. It has remained the seat of political power, even as the military stepped back and allowed for elections that paved the way for the country\u2019s partial democracy.\\r\\nFifteen years on, Naypyidaw is a reminder that although the country now has the veneer of democracy, the military retains true power. Much in the city is a testament to its authority and its desire to shape how it is perceived.\\r\\nThe monumental buildings seem designed to impress, but mostly they accentuate an overwhelming lack of people.\\r\\nThe roads in the city, which in places swell to 16 lanes, would seem unnecessarily huge even with a crush of vehicles, but there is almost no traffic at all, at rush hour or anytime. Motor scooters easily outnumber cars.\\r\\nDriving down them feels like cruising on a runway instead of a highway, and many seem like alternate landing strips for the country\u2019s Air Force in case of war.\\r\\nThe Parliament complex, a series of giant concrete structures, has the air of a fortress, with the reservoir surrounding it resembling a moat.\\r\\nA gilded pagoda towers over the nearby jungle. A replica of the country\u2019s famed Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, it stands just a tad shorter than the original to show a smidgen of deference to the sacred Buddhist monument.\\r\\nThe military has a self-appointed role as a protector of Buddhism, the majority religion in this country with Muslim and Christian minorities.\\r\\nYet even in a city filled with reminders of the military\u2019s might, the country\u2019s sprawling Defense Services Museum, set on 600 acres, perhaps best showcases the mind-set of a military force preoccupied with its reputation and showing off its power. Unofficial estimates of the museum\u2019s floor space put its size at around 540,000 square feet, not much smaller than the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.\\r\\n\u201cThere are military museums in other countries, but the one in Naypyidaw is way too big in comparison,\u201d Mr. Ye Myo Hein said.\\r\\nA dozen display halls, each easily as big as a football field, show off bombs, mines, machine guns, mortars, warplanes and artillery. Photos of military leaders saluting and congratulating one another are everywhere.\\r\\nElaborate dioramas portray optimistic versions of the military\u2019s capabilities. One demonstrating the military\u2019s communications capabilities includes a tiny model of an aircraft carrier. Myanmar\u2019s Navy has no aircraft carrier.\\r\\nLess overtly militaristic mementos abound, too \u2014 like a soccer ball from when Myanmar\u2019s national team was ably coached by a colonel, and a plaque from the U.S.S. North Carolina Battleship Commission, sent in thanks for Myanmar\u2019s help supplying teak to replace the decks of the World War II-era ship.\\r\\nBut aside from groups of soldiers, whose visits are likely mandatory, there are not many people to admire these artifacts. On a recent visit, museum staff members easily outnumbered the civilians wandering the halls, mostly monks in small groups. One attendant said the museum typically has just a few visitors each day, with an occasional school group.\\r\\nNine Burmese political analysts contacted said they couldn\u2019t talk about the museum \u2014 because none had been there.\\r\\nA military representative declined to discuss details of the museum.\\r\\nFor decades the military used newspapers, radio and television to spread propaganda. In the museum\u2019s wing dedicated to psychological warfare, a to-scale model of a television studio recalled those efforts.\\r\\nNew technology has both threatened, and amplified, those abilities. As Facebook began to proliferate in the country in 2012, many voices on the platform were anti-military.\\r\\nBut Myanmar\u2019s military quickly recognized Facebook\u2019s potential as a convenient way to connect to people, making it an important new tool in an ongoing information war, even if its senior general is no longer allowed on the site.\\r\\n\u201cFacebook is great for propaganda,\u201d said U Myat Thu, a researcher who works to combat hate speech on the site.\\r\\nAnd while the museum may struggle to attract visitors, the military has figured out how to draw crowds to a far more accessible location: the internet.\\r\\n\u201cNo one watches military television or reads their newspaper,\u201d Mr. Myat Thu said. \u201cBut they do look at social media.

Forget small talk: The pair will focus on trade.\\r\\nA deal may be in the works. The WSJ reports that the U.S. and China \u201care exploring a trade deal in which Washington would hold off on further tariffs through the spring in exchange for new talks looking at big changes in Chinese economic policy,\u201d according to unidentified sources.\\r\\nBut Mr. Trump remains unpredictable. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we want to do it,\u201d he told reporters yesterday. \u201cI\u2019m open to making a deal, but frankly, I like the deal we have now.\u201d The president said this week that he would probably still increase tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods on Jan. 1.\\r\\nAnd a long-term truce may be a pipe dream. \u201cAny agreement in Argentina will be a tactical pause at best,\u201d Ely Ratner argues in Foreign Affairs. \u201cOn most issues of consequence, there is simply no overlap between Xi\u2019s vision for China\u2019s rise and what the United States considers an acceptable future for Asia and the world beyond.\u201d\\r\\n____________________________\\r\\nToday\u2019s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York, and Michael J. de la Merced and Jamie Condliffe in London.\\r\\n____________________________\\r\\nTrump\u2019s business ties with Russia run deeper than we thought\\r\\nMichael Cohen pleaded guilty yesterday to lying to Congress. It\u2019s the first charge that President Trump\u2019s former top lawyer faced from Robert Mueller, the special counsel. But Mr. Cohen\u2019s admission that Mr. Trump was more involved in trying to build a tower in Moscow than had originally been stated was the real news.\\r\\nWhat happened: Mr. Cohen said that he and an associate spoke with Russian contacts for months in 2016 about the Trump group\u2019s plans for a huge new building in Moscow. The proposal included giving President Vladimir Putin of Russia a $50 million penthouse in the tower, BuzzFeed News reports, citing unnamed sources.\\r\\nWhy it might be a big deal: The NYT reports that Mr. Cohen\u2019s admission \u201craises the possibility that he might have information about the central focus of the inquiry: whether President Trump or any of his associates conspired with Russia\u2019s efforts to disrupt the 2016 election.\u201d The NYT also asks: Did the effort influence Mr. Trump\u2019s views on U.S. sanctions on Russia?\\r\\nThe White House response: Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers played down the news, saying that the president\u2019s written statements about his Moscow dealings matched Mr. Cohen\u2019s account. The president said yesterday that he would have gone back to business had he lost in 2016, so \u201cwhy should I lose lots of opportunities?\u201d\\r\\nFacebook\u2019s vetting of George Soros finances\\r\\nIt seems that Sheryl Sandberg wasn\u2019t thrilled when the liberal billionaire delivered a speech at the World Economic Forum in January calling Facebook and Google a \u201cmenace\u201d to society and expressing support for more regulation of the companies.\\r\\nMs. Sandberg is said to have questioned his motivations. She \u201casked Facebook\u2019s communications staff to research George Soros\u2019s financial interests in the wake of his high-profile attacks on tech companies, according to three people with knowledge of her request,\u201d write Nicholas Confessore and Matthew Rosenberg of the NYT. Specifically, she wanted to know whether he was betting against the company\u2019s stock.\\r\\nFacebook says the vetting started earlier. \u201cMr. Soros is a prominent investor, and we looked into his investments and trading activity related to Facebook,\u201d the company said. \u201cThat research was already underway when Sheryl sent an email asking if Mr. Soros had shorted Facebook\u2019s stock.\u201d\\r\\nThis compounds Facebook\u2019s recent P.R. scandal. \u201cThe revelation complicates Ms. Sandberg\u2019s shifting explanations of her role in Facebook\u2019s decisions to hire Definers and go on the offensive against the social network\u2019s growing legion of critics,\u201d including Mr. Soros, Mr. Confessore and Mr. Rosenberg add.\\r\\nMore Facebook news: The company will reportedly release findings of an audit of civil rights on its platform this year.

But The Intercept writes that internally, some executives tried to push the work forward while shutting out its own privacy and security specialists.\\r\\nSome staff members didn\u2019t like what they heard. Citing unidentified sources who worked on the China project, the Intercept claims that some Google workers were \u201cleft stunned\u201d by a February 2017 meeting that detailed the China work. They worried about how the Chinese government could use a new search product against its citizens.\\r\\nSenior executives reportedly dismissed those concerns. Scott Beaumont, Google\u2019s head of operations in China, is said to have \u201cshut out members of the company\u2019s security and privacy team from key meetings about the search engine, the four people said, and tried to sideline a privacy review of the plan that sought to address potential human rights abuses.\u201d\\r\\nAnd they were super-nervous about leaks. \u201cGoogle\u2019s leadership considered Dragonfly so sensitive that they would often communicate only verbally about it and would not take written notes during high-level meetings to reduce the paper trail, two sources said.\u201d\\r\\nThe bottom line: Google knows how controversial its China project is, but that doesn\u2019t appear to be stopping its executives from pushing the plans forward.\\r\\nThe Fed will raise rates in December. After that, things are less clear.\\r\\nThe U.S. central bank is poised to raise interest rates next month, according to minutes from its November meeting.

It will also lay off 12,000 employees, or about 10 percent of its work force. It\u2019s a sign that some of its biggest-ever deals have become burdensome, and two in particular appear to be too unwieldy for shareholders\u2019 liking:\\r\\nThe Merck deal. Bayer bought Merck\u2019s consumer businesses, including Coppertone and Dr. Scholl\u2019s, for $14.2 billion in 2014. But in yesterday\u2019s announcement, Bayer said selling them would help it \u201cfocus on driving profitable growth in its core consumer health categories.\u201d\\r\\nThe Monsanto acquisition.

Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.\\r\\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump had a clear message Monday when asked about the core conclusion of a scientific report issued by his own administration: that climate change will batter the nation\u2019s economy. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d he said.\\r\\nMr. Trump then laid responsibility for cleaning the atmosphere on other countries like China and Japan: \u201cRight now we\u2019re at the cleanest we\u2019ve ever been, and that\u2019s very important to me. But if we\u2019re clean but every other place on Earth is dirty, that\u2019s not so good. So I want clean air. I want clean water. Very important.\u201d \\r\\nThe remarks fit a pattern, and not just for their bluntness. In almost two years since taking office, Mr. Trump has denied the scientific reality of climate change and taken aggressive steps that will increase emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases \u2014 despite unequivocal scientific evidence that those pollutants are warming the planet to dangerous levels.\\r\\n\u201cSince virtually the first day the administration came into office they have systematically worked to reverse policies in place to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d said Robert N. Stavins, a professor of environmental economics at Harvard. \u201cBut this report, which is mandated by law, shows that greenhouse gas emissions are going to have profound effects on the United States in this century.\u201d\\r\\nThe report Mr. Trump referred to, the National Climate Assessment, issued on Friday, was the product of four years of work by 13 federal agencies. It concluded that \u201cEarth\u2019s climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities,\u201d and adds, \u201cthe severity of future impacts will depend largely on actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d\\r\\nThose impacts include more devastating wildfires, severe storms and coastal flooding, droughts, crop failures, water shortages, threats to public health and the loss of hundreds of billions of dollars to the American economy, according to the authors. \\r\\nBut in his disregard for scientific evidence, Mr. Trump has made the dismantling of policies to curb greenhouse pollution a centerpiece of his deregulatory agenda.\\r\\nThe most direct way the Trump administration is working to allow more greenhouse gas emissions is by weakening the Obama-era regulations meant to reduce pollution at its source: the smokestacks of power plants and tailpipes of automobiles.\\r\\nA \u2018calculated effort\u2019 on coal\\r\\nIn 2015 the Obama administration put forward its signature climate measure, the Clean Power Plan, designed to cut greenhouse pollution from power plants 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. That would be the equivalent of preventing more than 365 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere.\\r\\nBy contrast, the Trump administration\u2019s replacement unveiled in August, known as the Affordable Clean Energy rule, sets no national benchmark. It aims to cut carbon dioxide emissions from 2005 levels by 0.7 to 1.5 percent by 2030.\\r\\nAccording to estimates by environmental groups, that means the amount of carbon dioxide emitted from American power plants over the next decade could be up to 12 times higher than it would have been under the Obama-era plan.\\r\\n\u201cThese are life-extension projects for coal plants,\u201d said Jody Freeman, a Harvard law professor and former counsel to the Obama administration. \u201cIt\u2019s a very calculated effort to go in the opposite direction from what\u2019s needed.\u201d\\r\\nThe \u2018exact opposite signal\u2019 on car emissions\\r\\nIn 2012, the Obama administration put forth a major regulation on planet-warming pollution from vehicle tailpipes, requiring automakers to nearly double the fuel economy of passenger vehicles to an average of about 54 miles per gallon by 2025.\\r\\nIf fully implemented, the plan would have cut about six billion tons of greenhouse gas pollution over its lifetime, the equivalent of roughly a year\u2019s worth of greenhouse pollution for the entire country. \\r\\nIn August, the Trump administration published a proposal designed to drastically weaken that rule, freezing average fuel economy standards after 2021 at about 37 miles per gallon. While that rollback is not yet final, early analysis shows that it could lead to the increase of up to a billion tons of greenhouse gas pollution from 2012 levels. \\r\\n\u201cThey were a big deal because vehicle travel is one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d said David G. Victor, director of the Laboratory on International Law and Regulation at the University of California, San Diego, of the Obama-era tailpipe rules.\\r\\n\u201cAnd they sent a long-term signal to Detroit that they need to make vehicles that produce fewer emissions,\u201d Dr. Victor said. \u201cAttempting to loosen them has sent the exact opposite signal to Detroit.\u201d\\r\\nMore methane in the atmosphere\\r\\nThe Trump administration isn\u2019t only loosening Obama-era efforts to curb carbon dioxide emissions. It has also taken multiple steps to make it easier for oil and gas companies to release methane into the atmosphere.\\r\\nMethane is a potent greenhouse gas \u2014 about 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide in its ability to trap heat in the atmosphere. It is emitted from landfills and coal-fired power plants, burned as part of oil drilling operations and routinely leaked into the atmosphere from faulty oil and gas wells.\\r\\nUnder Mr. Trump, both the E.P.A. and the Interior Department have proposed weakening Obama-era requirements that companies repair and monitor methane leaks in wells. New rules under consideration would also loosen restrictions on \u201cflaring,\u201d the burning of methane from drilling operations.\\r\\nThe Obama administration had estimated its steps to regulate methane would prevent the equivalent of 11 million tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere by 2025. \\r\\nExperts say a rise in methane emissions is an inevitable consequence of Mr. Trump\u2019s rollbacks.\\r\\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that dumping the venting-and-flaring rule is causing increases in emissions,\u201d said David J. Hayes, a former deputy secretary of the interior during the Clinton and Obama administrations.\\r\\nA global leadership void\\r\\nFinally, there is the Trump administration\u2019s vow to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, a voluntary accord under which nearly every country in the world has agreed to reduce emissions.\\r\\nPresident Barack Obama pledged the United States would cut carbon at least 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. The Trump administration cannot formally withdraw from the Paris pact for two more years, but in rolling back key climate regulations it has effectively stopped all efforts to meet that goal.\\r\\nBut the United States\u2019 role in the Paris Agreement was never just about driving down America\u2019s own emissions. It was also about using its leadership to prod major developing countries like China, India and Brazil to also reduce their emissions despite still climbing out of poverty. Those countries, under United Nations rules agreed to by the United States in the 1990s, also are not legally obligated to cut carbon because of their status as developing nations.\\r\\n\u201cWhen the U.S. is not taking action on climate it makes it incredibly difficult for countries with lesser means than ours to take action themselves,\u201d said Richard G. Newell, president of Resources for the Future, a nonpartisan Washington-based research organization.\\r\\nAlready Mr. Trump\u2019s actions seem to be reverberating in rich and poor countries alike. Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, has threatened to pull out of the Paris Agreement. His conservative government has since said it will honor its pledges, but the country\u2019s energy policy contains no plans for curbing emissions.\\r\\nIn Brazil, the far-right populist President-elect Jair Bolsonaro campaigned on a vow of pulling out of the Paris Agreement.\\r\\nChina, on the other hand, has worked to position itself as the new leader on climate change.\\r\\nCountries will meet in December in Katowice, the heart of Poland\u2019s coal country, to finalize a set of rules for implementing the Paris Agreement. The United States will attend the talks and, despite the intended rollbacks, is expected to push other countries to be more transparent about their own plans for cutting emissions.\\r\\nFor more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1205115319,\"description\":\"Since his earliest days in office, President Trump has been taking steps that increase emissions of the heat-trapping greenhouse gases that are warming the planet to dangerous levels.\\r\",\"title\":\"How Trump Is Ensuring That Greenhouse Gas Emissions Will Rise\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.32.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"\\n\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":123527019,\"description\":\"Cockroaches deploy a stunning, and largely unstudied, karate-style kick to prevent wasp attacks.\\r\",\"title\":\"The Cockroach Karate Kick That Fends Off Wasps\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.30.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Many YouTube videos about prostate cancer are unreliable sources of information.\\r\\nResearchers searched YouTube for \u201cprostate cancer screening\u201d and \u201cprostate cancer treatment.\u201d Then they scored the first 75 hits for each phrase, using validated scales to assess such measures as whether the video favored new technology, recommended unproven treatments, accurately described risks and benefits or showed commercial bias.\\r\\nOutdated, biased or inaccurate videos were viewed more than 6.3 million times.

Still, she could not contain her inner rah-rah: Whenever a jogger passed, she stopped to cheer them on.\\r\\nAnd then she resumed the conversation, back to the art of the undersell.\\r\\n\u201cI have magazines and cookbooks, come on,\u201d she said, pooh-poohing the idea of her as any kind of political figure, ceremonial or otherwise. \u201cIt\u2019s not who I am,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t do that.\u201d\\r\\nThere might have been a time when that was indisputably true, certainly in the 1990s, when Sandra Lee started her first successful business enterprise from this Los Angeles suburb, in a rear bedroom of her relatives\u2019 house.\\r\\nBut that was before she became a television cooking celebrity, before her relationship with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, and well before her extended and well-documented bouts with breast cancer.\\r\\nAnd it was absolutely before her cellphone rang that day.\\r\\nIt was Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, a Democrat like Mr. Cuomo. And just like that, Ms. Lee \u2014 the reluctant and unofficial first lady of New York \u2014 started to pitch Mr. Inslee on replicating a New York law concerning cancer coverage, urging him to provide money in his state\u2019s budget for screenings and asking if she can send him bill language to examine.\\r\\nAll the while, Ms. Lee, who had just laughed off the idea of herself as a political player, is nodding and smiling at Mr. Inslee\u2019s seemingly encouraging response. She thanked the governor for his time, and then signed off.\\r\\n\u201cPlease tell the first lady,\u201d Ms. Lee said, \u201cthat the first girlfriend said hello.\u201d\\r\\n[What you need to know to start your day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]\\r\\nIt would be difficult to describe a woman who has spent much of her adult life in front of television cameras as reclusive; Ms. Lee is arguably more famous as a Food Network star than Mr. Cuomo is as a governor. But during the governor\u2019s nearly eight years in office, Ms. Lee has largely avoided the political spotlight, appearing only sporadically at events like Easter egg hunts and gay pride parades.\\r\\nShe does not campaign with Mr. Cuomo, and while she stood beaming on the dais in Midtown Manhattan on election night, as he was easily elected to a third term, she was not in photos of the campaign and governmental team taken at a private celebration later.\\r\\nIn recent months, however, Ms. Lee has begun to flex her ample charm and determination in what she calls \u201cmy campaign,\u201d a nationwide effort to fight breast cancer. Ms. Lee, 52, is a survivor of that disease, having been diagnosed in March 2015; she underwent a double mastectomy two months later.\\r\\nThat procedure is a central part of an HBO documentary, \u201cRx: Early Detection, A Cancer Journey with Sandra Lee,\u201d that her company, Sandra Lee Incorporated, produced and debuted in October.\\r\\nAs part of the campaign to promote the film and her cause, Ms. Lee offered The New York Times a rare glimpse of her life and partnership with Mr. Cuomo, as she highlighted her efforts to get other states to replicate a so-called \u201cNo Excuses\u201d bill that Mr. Cuomo signed in 2016, expanding breast cancer screening and eliminating insurance co-pays for screening mammograms.\\r\\nMs. Lee has been carefully assembling a to-do list \u2014 color-coded, naturally \u2014 and calling top officials in several Democrat-led states. And while her method of lobbying is often as casual as her \u201csemi-homemade\u201d cuisine, which famously combines prepackaged ingredients with a smattering of fresh ones, her intentions are far more deliberate.\\r\\n\u201cI think that the older that you get and the more thoughtful that you get and the more educated that you get about the well-being of the next generation to come, you have to be focused,\u201d Ms. Lee said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not spending your days making the planet a better place, what are you doing?\u201d\\r\\nIn conversation, she is unfiltered, self-effacing and frequently extemporaneous. At one point during an interview, she handed a reporter a handwritten copy of her favorite smoothie recipe. \u201cYou should have that every morning,\u201d she said.\\r\\nIn speaking about politics, she immediately mentioned her distaste for it, particularly the bare-knuckled variety practiced in New York, where Mr. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio have often skirmished.\\r\\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the nonsense of the fighting,\u201d Ms. Lee said. \u201cI think it\u2019s unnecessary. I think everybody deserves a seat at the table, and everybody gets a say.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cI hate conflict,\u201d she added, at another moment. \u201cConflict and I am not \u2026\u201d Then she stops, and suddenly pivots. \u201cI like Bill de Blasio. I like him. We have a rapport,\u201d she said.\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019ll stand there and I like him. I do,\u201d she concluded. \u201cI don\u2019t like conflict. With anybody.\u201d\\r\\nThat bonhomie could be catching: Mr. de Blasio\u2019s Office of Media and Entertainment honored Ms. Lee at the Gotham Awards on Monday for her 40-minute film, which is arresting in its portrait of her medical battle, with graphic depictions of the surgery and her recovery, including nudity and necrotizing skin.\\r\\nAnd that was the point, she said.\\r\\n\u201cI want this to be a tool for people that have to do it to understand what it means to do it,\u201d Ms. Lee said. \u201cAnd I want people who have done it to understand what they went through.\u201d\\r\\nThe film also makes clear how serious Ms. Lee\u2019s health problems were. The cancer was initially found in three spots in her right breast, and surgeons found even more cancerous tissue. She herself has said she did not realize how bloody and invasive the surgery was until she saw the raw footage.\\r\\n\u201cI went into the editing bay and it was the surgery and I just started crying,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI walked in and immediately lost it.\u201d\\r\\nThe battle with the disease was just the latest chapter in a personal biography with enough turns and tribulation for a telenovela.\\r\\nThe eldest of five children, Ms. Lee grew up in chaotic fashion in California, Washington and Wisconsin (three states, not surprisingly, where she plans to lobby elected officials about copying Mr. Cuomo\u2019s cancer bill). When Ms. Lee was 2, her mother, then 18, dropped her and her younger sister at their grandmother\u2019s house in Santa Monica.\\r\\n\u201cShe left that day promising to return shortly,\u201d Ms. Lee wrote in her 2007 memoir, \u201cMade from Scratch.\u201d \u201cWe didn\u2019t see her again for several years.\u201d\\r\\nWhen her mother returned, the family moved to Washington and became Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. Her mother was abusive, depressive and suicidal, and her stepfather beat her with a belt and molested her. She started working at 13 and left home at 15, headed for Wisconsin to live with her birth father.\\r\\nBut after her father was sent to jail for two years on a charge of second-degree sexual assault during a domestic violence incident involving an argument with his girlfriend \u2014 Ms. Lee had to testify against him \u2014 Ms. Lee\u2019s aunt and uncle offered her a place to live in California.\\r\\nShe accepted, and soon after she started her first business \u2014 a line of window dressing accouterment \u2014 out of their house.

It was also a gateway to her Food Network career.\\r\\nMs. Lee met Mr. Cuomo at a party in 2005, the same year that her four-year marriage to Bruce Karatz, the former chief executive of KB Home, ended in divorce.\\r\\nMargaret Cuomo, the governor\u2019s sister, called Ms. Lee \u201cmy de facto sister,\u201d and said that her influence on Mr. Cuomo is invaluable. \u201cIt\u2019s a high-stress job and not everyone will have his best interest in mind,\u201d she said. \u201cShe does. And that\u2019s a precious gift.\u201d\\r\\nMs. Lee is protective of her relationship with Mr. Cuomo, and of his three daughters from a previous marriage to Kerry Kennedy \u2014 Cara, Michaela and Mariah \u2014 to whom she has been a surrogate mother for more than a decade.\\r\\nOn a tour of the house they share in New Castle, N.Y., much of it is deemed off-the-record, if not off-limits. What she did share showed a family home festooned with all manner of personal memento and political keepsakes: a dining room lined with reproductions of letters from the Founding Fathers and an antique ballot box; a den with a wall-size, wooden replica of the Constitution; hallways and stairwells densely populated with casual photos of family and friends, including former President Barack Obama.\\r\\nThe kitchen contains a space-capsule-size cage for Ms. Lee\u2019s two cockatoos \u2014 Phoenix and Halo \u2014 adjacent to an almost all-white sitting room, with views of the patio fireplace on one side and on the other, a duck pond, surrounded by small signs noting the New York State Police patrols to warn off trespassers.\\r\\nMs. Lee\u2019s two Emmy Awards sit on a piano that belonged to her grandmother. Bathroom hand towels are adorned with gold Cs and Ls, in cursive. They are disposable.\\r\\nMs. Lee mostly sidestepped questions about Mr. Cuomo, but allowed that she was affected by what she said were unfair portrayals of his character.\\r\\n\u201cI am the one who watches him work every single hour of every single day and not sleep,\u201d Ms. Lee said, sitting outside their home surrounded by pumpkins and other autumnal decorations.\\r\\nEmotion stopped her for a moment, and then she continued.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to watch this be hard on someone you love. And know that they do everything right, every day, for everyone,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s not O.K.\u201d\\r\\nShe continued: \u201cI think if people saw the day to day, they would only say, \u2018Thank you.\u2019 That\u2019s the truth.\u201d\\r\\nMs. Lee even briefly became an issue on the campaign trail, when Mr. Cuomo\u2019s Republican opponent, Marcus J. Molinaro, suggested that her financial information should be made public. (Because they are not married, Mr. Cuomo does not have to disclose any information about Ms. Lee\u2019s business dealings.) Ms. Lee did not feel that was warranted, and said she appreciated Mr. Molinaro\u2019s wife telling him to not attack her.\\r\\nIn another aside, during the pre-election stroll in Van Nuys, she also dismissed talk that Mr. Cuomo would run for president. \u201cHe\u2019s told me he doesn\u2019t have any interest right now,\u201d she said.\\r\\nAgain and again, Ms. Lee said she understands how politics works \u2014 \u201cI know how to maneuver it. I have friends that are in it, obviously my partner is part of it,\u201d she said \u2014 but she wants to stay out of the fray.\\r\\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to get mad, get mad because someone has cancer,\u201d she said. Or because children are hungry, or \u201celderly people are being abused.\u201d\\r\\nAnd then, she said, turn that anger into action.\\r\\nIn the meantime, other projects await: a how-to show with her sister, Kimber; a series of children\u2019s books featuring a character called Aunt Sandy Claus; another series based on her 2013 novel \u201cThe Recipe Box.\u201d\\r\\nShe also said she wants to do a documentary about dying, tentatively called \u201cSilent Lucidity,\u201d a title borrowed from the heavy metal band Queensr\u00ffche, one of several hard-rock groups she likes. (Def Leppard, Rush and Led Zeppelin also make the cut.)\\r\\nMs. Lee is healthy; she announced in 2016 that she is cancer free. Still, there\u2019s something in her that suggests that she now sees the world in the same winner-take-all prism that Mr. Cuomo often does.\\r\\n\u201cWere you part of the solution or were you part of the problem?\u201d she said, calling her life and body \u201cjust a vessel\u201d for good works. \u201cAnd I think you have to choose every single day which part of that you\u2019re going to be on.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-701746304,\"description\":\"Ms. Lee, Gov.

The majority of the strikers, 7,700 people at 23 properties, were in a dispute with Marriott International, the world\u2019s largest hotel chain, which had net profits in 2017 of $1.37 billion.\\r\\nMs. Carson, who owns Weddings of Hawaii,  said she had to rearrange 15 to 20 dinners and receptions at venues that closed because of the strike. The hotels involved were the Royal Hawaiian, Westin Moana Surfrider, Sheraton Princess Kaiulani and Sheraton Waikiki, all in Honolulu, as well as the Sheraton Maui Hotel in Lahaina.\\r\\n\u201cWe had one group that was about 35 people and with only two days we had to find somewhere that could accommodate them,\u201d she said.

There, workers at the Cambria Hotel Chicago Magnificent Mile, part of the Choice Hotels International chain, remain on strike, while United Here reached a deal with the other hotels. \\r\\nWhat\u2019s the dispute about? \\r\\nIn San Francisco, issues include health care coverage and wages, which the union said haven\u2019t kept up with the cost of living in the Bay Area. When the previous contract expired, the median income for its employees was $44,000, the union said. The housekeepers also want better protection from sexual harassment, and more time to clean the rooms that aren\u2019t serviced daily as part of Marriott\u2019s \u201cMake A Green Choice\u201d program, which offers incentives to guests who forgo daily housekeeping.\\r\\nMarriott International has management or franchise agreements with about 6,700 hotels under 30 brands in 130 countries and territories. \\r\\nWhat did the settlements include? \\r\\nDetails of the financial packages with Marriott won\u2019t be released until an agreement is reached in San Francisco. But deals have been reached covering 5,200 employees at 16 Marriott-operated properties, including seven in Boston, and one hotel each in Detroit, San Jose, Calif., Oakland, Calif., and San Diego.\\r\\n All of the contracts with Marriott thus far cover job security, worker involvement in the use of technology and a reduction in workload for housekeepers, the union said. Although Hawaii doesn\u2019t have the \u201cMake A Green Choice\u201d program, the room quota for housekeepers there was reduced by one room per day, to 13 rooms, at most of the hotels.\\r\\nThe new contracts also mean that housekeepers will be provided with a silent panic button to summon help if they feel threatened, in an effort to address sexual harassment. And in a move to address the effects of mass incarceration on job seekers, those with minor nonviolent drug offenses will be able to hold union jobs, Ms. Gumpert said. \\r\\nIn Hawaii and Boston, the deals also covered a so-called child\/elder fund in which Marriott sets aside money to assist with the cost of caring for young children or older relatives, she said. Hawaii also included an increase in health and pension contributions.\\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased to have ratified contracts in both Boston and Hawaii and are welcoming associates back at work,\u201d Ms. Kim, the Marriott spokeswoman, said.\\r\\nWhat are the hotels doing for inconvenienced travelers? \\r\\nEven with most of the hotels back to normal, the headache isn\u2019t over for everyone.

But it was not until recently that researchers, analyzing those objects with advanced photography, were able to decipher the ring\u2019s inscription.\\r\\nIt reads \u201cof Pilates,\u201d in Greek letters set around a picture of a wine vessel known as a krater, and is said by archaeologists to be only the second artifact from his time ever found with his name. Kraters are a common image in artifacts of that time and place.\\r\\nThe findings were published last week in the Israel Exploration Journal, an archaeological review in Israel.\\r\\nPilate was the prefect, or governor, of the province of Judea, on the eastern fringes of the Roman Empire, roughly from A.D. 26 to 36.\\r\\nThe report says it is unlikely that the ring belonged to Pilate, in part because such simple rings usually belonged to soldiers and lesser officials, not to someone as wealthy and powerful as a prefect.\\r\\n\u201cWe think it implausible that a prefect would have used a simple, all-metal, copper-alloy personal sealing ring with a motif that was already a well-known Jewish motif in Judea before and during his rule,\u201d it says.\\r\\n\u201cBut in practice, we have a ring inscribed with the name Pilate and the personal connection just cries out,\u201d Roi Porat, one of the authors of the report told The Times of Israel. The name Pilate was not common in the region at the time.\\r\\nThe New Testament story of Pilate presenting a scourged Jesus to an angry crowd with the words \u201cbehold the man\u201d \u2014 \u201cecce homo\u201d in Latin \u2014 was a central theme of religious art for centuries.\\r\\nBeyond the Gospel, most of what little is known about Pilate comes from the surviving work of the ancient historians Flavius Josephus, a Jew, and Tacitus, a Roman.\\r\\nHerodium, where the ring was found, was built by Herod the Great, a client king of the Roman Empire, and is the site of his tomb. (One of his sons, also named Herod, was king in Jesus\u2019 time.) The site is controlled by Israel and is claimed by Palestinians.\\r\\nThe ring was found in a room filled with bits of glass, shards of pottery, arrowheads, coins and other items.\\r\\nThe language of the ring\u2019s inscription is Greek, which Roman officials used to communicate with the peoples of the eastern Mediterranean. It could have been used for official correspondence by Pilate himself and his officials who had to sign his name.\\r\\nThe first archaeological find in Judea that mentioned Pilate was a fragment of carved stone, discovered in 1961, in the ancient port city of Caesarea. It is known as the Pilate stone and is kept at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.\\r\\n\u201cIt solved the problem of what actual title he had,\u201d said Jonathan Price, professor of classics and ancient history at Tel Aviv University.\\r\\nAccording to Mr. Price, for historians of the Roman period, Pilate was just one of a string of Roman officials who were sent to Judea to govern and keep the peace.

It\u2019s also the most detailed guide yet to all the ways the country will have to adapt.\\r\\nEven if the nations of the world get their act together and slash fossil-fuel emissions rapidly, the United States will need to spend many billions of dollars to harden coastlines, rebuild sewer systems and overhaul farming practices to protect against floods, wildfires and heat waves that are already causing havoc nationwide. And the more that emissions rise, the more difficult and costly that task gets.\\r\\nThe United States isn\u2019t prepared. In the Midwest, the report notes, only four counties and cities have written climate change plans. This in a region where scientists are forecasting bigger crop failures and heavier floods that could cripple transportation networks. And at the federal level, the Trump administration is rolling back policies to take future sea-level rise into account when building new roads and railways.\\r\\nBelow are five major steps the scientific report says the country will need to take in the decades ahead:\\r\\n1. Rethink how we farm\\r\\nThe nation\u2019s food supply could be in jeopardy as global warming intensifies, the report warns. Crop yields for corn, wheat and soy tend to decline as the number of extremely hot days increases. More frequent droughts could reduce supplies of irrigation water. Dairy cows produce less milk in the sweltering heat.\\r\\nFarmers will have to rethink their practices in response. \\r\\nIn areas at risk of drought, they could use more precise irrigation techniques to conserve water. Agricultural regions could build new weather networks that provide more detailed climate forecasts, to help farmers make better decisions about which crops to plant, and when. In places like the Great Plains, dairy farmers and ranchers may need to relocate production or invest in climate-controlled buildings to protect their cattle from heat stress.\\r\\nBut the report emphasizes, \u201cthese approaches have limits under severe climate change impacts.\u201d\\r\\nOne hope is that seed companies might develop new crop varieties that are better able to tolerate drought, heat waves and pests. However, the report cautions that \u201cprogress in this area has been modest\u201d and calls for much greater public investment. \\r\\n2. Build for the future, not the past\\r\\nMuch of the nation\u2019s infrastructure, including things like roads and sewers, was built with historical weather conditions in mind. But as extreme weather becomes more frequent, the report says, the past is no longer a good guide to the future.\\r\\nIn Hampton Roads, Va., nearly half of residents reported being unable to drive out of their neighborhoods at some point last year because of flooding at high tide as sea levels have risen. In the Northeast, sewer systems built for the storms of the past are expected to overflow more frequently as climate change brings heavier rainfall.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s still not standard practice for engineers to think about future climate,\u201d said Costa Samaras, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. While a few cities, like New York and Baltimore, have begun using climate forecasts in their infrastructure planning, he said, \u201cit\u2019s not as widespread as it needs to be.\u201d\\r\\n3. Retreat from the coasts\\r\\nDepending on how rapidly emissions increase, global sea levels are likely to rise between 1 and 4 feet (or even more) this century, the report says, potentially putting trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of coastal homes and businesses in the United States at risk of flooding.\\r\\nWhile large cities like New York and Boston will likely invest heavily in sea walls, tide gates and pumping stations, they won\u2019t be able to protect everyone. In places like Norfolk, Va., officials are already pondering the prospect of relocating certain vulnerable neighborhoods.\\r\\nUltimately, the report warns, millions of people nationwide may have to move away from the coasts. Yet most policymakers are reluctant to even broach the topic. Many local governments, in search of more tax revenue, still promote development along coastlines. And a bevy of federal policies, such as subsidized flood insurance and efforts to rebuild communities in place after disasters, still discourage people from moving away from at-risk areas.\\r\\nKatherine Greig, a senior fellow at the Wharton Risk Center and co-author of the report\u2019s chapter on adaptation, said that \u201cWe\u2019re still a long ways\u201d from having \u201ca serious conversation about retreat.\u201d\\r\\n4. Enlist nature to help\\r\\nClimate adaptation isn\u2019t just a matter of redesigning roads or power plants to be more resilient to extreme weather. The report also details ways that our natural environment, if managed properly, can be a cost-effective defense against climate change.\\r\\nPlanting more trees in cities can help reduce urban temperatures and protect people from deadly heat waves. Restoring degraded wetlands and marshes can protect cities and coasts from flooding and improve water quality. Healthy forests that are allowed to burn at a low level periodically, as they did in the distant past, are less prone to extreme wildfires. Protecting pollinators could help make our agricultural system more resilient.\\r\\nOne example from the report: Several Midwestern cities, including Milwaukee, have begun a large-scale effort to restore streams to their natural state, removing concrete linings, so that they can safely carry away more water during heavy storms.\\r\\n5. Expect the unexpected\\r\\nAs detailed as the new 1,656-page climate assessment is, the authors still warn that global warming is likely to bring unpredictable dangers, particularly as complex systems like energy, water, transportation and public health all come under severe stress at once.\\r\\nAs an example, Hurricane Harvey in Texas last year ended up shutting down gasoline refineries, straining hospitals, clogging roadways and spreading toxins and pathogens as floodwaters swamped the city. These sorts of \u201ccascading failures\u201d are difficult to study and predict in advance.\\r\\nAt a broad level, the report warns that officials at every level of government and in every corner of the economy will have to weave climate change into their decisions, to plan for a wide range of possible futures, and to continually re-evaluate those plans. \u201cAdaptation entails a continuing risk management process,\u201d the report notes. \u201cIt does not have an end point.\u201d\\r\\nFor more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1319101008,\"description\":\"A sweeping new climate report warns that the United States will have to spend billions of dollars to protect coastlines, rebuild sewers and overhaul farming.

And then, out of the silence, came a call: \u201cHere we go! May God watch over us!\u201d It\u2019s a refrain that is a tradition here on Lake Kivu, where for generations men have cast out at sunset on small wooden boats to fish through the night. But that night, it was chanted by women.\\r\\nZawadi Karikumutima, 32, readied her boat for a night on the water. She was not alone. Several other women loaded wooden rafts with supplies, while their children watched them from the muddy banks, and prepared themselves for the long night ahead. \\r\\n\u201cI am very tired when I come back,\u201d said Ms. Karikumutima as she pushed the boat around in the muddy shore. Sometimes she comes back with enough fish to sell to support her family for weeks at a time. \u201cBut sometimes I return with pretty much nothing,\u201d she said.\\r\\nSome fishermen and women on Lake Kivu cast their nets at sunset and return before dawn to collect their trappings. But that method can be risky: the nets can be tampered with, or the catch scooped up by interlopers in the midnight hours while everyone else is asleep. So instead, many of the fisherwomen choose to spend their nights on the water.\\r\\nBut nights on the lake can be uncomfortable and even dangerous, for any number of reasons \u2014 wind and pirates, among others. Last year, as a single mother, Ms. Karikumutima had no choice but to bring her infant baby out on the wooden boat with her at night, lying the baby down on a blanket in the hull of the canoe while she paddled from one net to another in the cold and the rain. The intense physical work and danger that comes with fishing on Lake Kivu, along with reinforcement from traditional gender roles, kept women from fishing for generations, tending to backyard farms instead. But in post-genocide Rwanda, that seems to be changing. \\r\\nToday, women form an essential part of the national market for Lake Kivu fish. Besides fishing on the lake at night, women also gather along the shores in the early morning to buy the fish the fisherwomen deliver. They then haul those fish home to their small villages, or sell the fish to cooperatives. At the cooperatives, other women manage drying stations, where the fish are turned into a more compact, shriveled-up product that\u2019s easier to transport. Women transport the fish across the country, in buckets and sacks, and they also sell the fish in urban markets all around the country, to landlocked Rwandans. The fish economy has created opportunities for women to form collectives and income.\\r\\nBonifrida Mukabideri often fishes with Ms. Karikumutima and is a founding member of Projet P\u00eache, a fishing cooperative in Kibuye,  a resort town along the banks of Lake Kivu, made up of 87 women. \u201cA lot of women have used the cooperatives to fight poverty. Here in Rwanda we now have the idea that women and men can do every job,\u201d said Ms. Mukabideri, who supports 10 children, and has found a confidence boost by being a part of the cooperative. \u201cI am very proud to be a part of the cooperative. Now a woman can say: \u2018I can build a house by myself. I can look after my family properly. And even if my husband dies, we can live a better life.\u2019\u201d\\r\\nOn a recent early morning at the collective, the sambaza had just been delivered from the night fisherwomen. Dozens of women at the cooperative meticulously arranged them so that no fish overlapped with another; the idea was to allow the sun to dry all the fish evenly, which happens after about 48 sunny hours. Sold dry sambaza go for a higher price than they do fresh. And in Eastern Rwanda, they form a central part of the edible economy; almost every dish in the restaurants along the lush banks of Lake Kivu incorporates sambaza, but perhaps most tastily as the crispy fried accompaniment to a sunset beer. \\r\\nRachel Nyirarvshisha, 43, had spent the night fishing, and that morning, she was busy cutting deals on her sambaza at the Projet P\u00eache fishing cooperative in Kibuye.\\r\\n\u201cDon\u2019t argue with me! It\u2019s 2,000 francs. Dried is 6,000. Cash in person,\u201d Ms. Nyirarvshisha said. She hung up the phone with a humph, and a satisfied smile. \\r\\nFive years ago, Ms. Nyirarvshisha\u2019s life was very different. She\u2019s from the Rwandan capital of Kigali, about a four-hour bus ride away, and took on odd jobs to support her two children. But in just the past few years, women like Ms. Nyirarvshisha have broken into the world of fishing, with a focus on the business side. Though not even five feet tall, Ms. Nyirarvshisha stands out for her bullheaded business style; she\u2019s the top seller among the women in the cooperative.\\r\\nPart of the reason women have entered the world of fishing in recent years has to do \u2014 as so many things do in Rwanda \u2014 with the country\u2019s history.\\r\\nIn 1994, Lake Kivu was a bloody place; the lush hills hid nightmarish scenes. The communities around the lake were ravaged by the chaos of the genocide, and Kibuye in particular was the site of some of the most gruesome incidents. \\r\\nIn the church on the road into Kibuye, thousands of Tutsi were murdered; survivors hid beneath the bodies for days. Just a five-minute walk up the hill from the fishing cooperative where Ms. Nyirarvshisha now dries her fish, the remaining Tutsis gathered at the soccer stadium for protection a few days after the church massacre. But Hutus climbed the walls around the field and fired down into the people, killing another several thousand people. Some tried to escape by lurching toward the lake in a bid to swim across the waters at night; an unknown number drowned. In the Kibuye area, 90 percent of the Tutsi population was killed in the genocide. The vibrant hills around Lake Kivu served as the backdrop for one of the darkest chapters in modern human history.\\r\\nIn rebuilding the country, the new government insisted on policies underpinned by the concept of equality, and the slogan \u201cWe are all Rwandans.\u201d That included women.\\r\\nThe genocide left Rwanda with a population that was 70 percent female; many women started fishing out of necessity, with so many primary breadwinner killed. But women in Rwanda have also started fishing thanks to changing concepts of gender; post-genocide, Rwandan society suddenly opened to the idea of female labor equality.\\r\\nThere is a male leader at the top of Projet P\u00eache \u2014 the only man involved: Robert Ngendahayo. Mr. Ngendahayo, 36, said the reason women were only now entering the fishing marketplace is because for many years, no one fished. \u201cIt was not safe to be out on the boat for many years after 1994. Someone would come and attack you and stab you,\u201d he said. The dark water of the lake at night became a kind of secondary war zone, where the new government controls being installed hadn\u2019t yet reached, and where you could still be killed on the basis of your perceived ethnicity. Mr. Ngendahayo estimates that night activity on the water started up again about seven years after the genocide, and then, only minimally and with caution for another decade, he said.\\r\\nPlus, spending the night on the boat with men was just not considered suitable for women. \u201cWomen farmed instead, and fishing was for men,\u201d said Albert Ngeze. Mr. Ngeze, 57, is a boat builder who bends the wood by hand to make the boats used on Lake Kivu. A former fisherman himself and now one of the oldest boat builders in the area, he has seen firsthand the way that things here have changed. \\r\\n\u201cWhen I was young, and before the genocide, it was impossible to see women fishing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut today we are happy for women to join us on the water. I think only a small percentage of men do not understand that. I think this century, everyone must understand that.\u201d\\r\\nToday, Mr. Ngendahayo calls the lake \u201c100 percent safe,\u201d but that\u2019s not entirely true. For one, there\u2019s the wind, which blows hard, especially during March and April. In the middle of the lake, a capsized boat can mean a long wait for help, if it makes it. There are also pirates, who, depending on the security conditions on land in either Rwanda or Democratic Republic of Congo, where there has been armed conflict for over 25 years, will maraud with impunity, leaving the already-poor fishermen and women with nothing, save their lives \u2014 if they\u2019re lucky. \\r\\nBut on a summertime morning the women smiled as they rowed smoothly across the water, their strong arms propelled the boats forward. These women once, not long ago, fought for their lives; a night on the lake, in comparison, and a chance to feed their families, is a risk many of them take. Ms. Mukabideri said she is happy when she is on the water. \u201cNowadays, all around the world things are changing, and so are we here,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I can go and spend a night out on the water, then it shows that things have changed.\u201d\\r\\nAs Ms. Mukabideri and Ms. Karikumutima set out with other women, they fell into a rhythm. Once out on the open water, they synchronized, and their chant became a kind of meditation, a hum as powerful as a drum beat, both soothing in its repetition and exciting in its rumble as it bounced off the hillsides.\\r\\n\u201cHere we go!\u201d\\r\\n_____\\r\\nShannon Sims, Holly Pickett, and Cl\u00e0udia Prat were 2018 African Great Lakes Reporting Fellows with the International Women\u2019s Media Foundation.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1396857189,\"description\":\"\u201cNow a woman can say: \u2018I can build a house by myself.

By 2034, the agency estimated, it will have depleted those reserves, and its revenues will cover only about four-fifths of its promised benefits.\\r\\n\u201cThere\u2019s a problem, but not a crisis,\u201d said Andrew Eschtruth, a researcher at the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. \u201cIt\u2019s something policymakers have acted on before, and the program has always paid full benefits.\u201d\\r\\nMaking adjustments to keep Social Security solvent, crucial as that is, represents only one of the issues confronting Congress. It could also correct outdated aspects of a program that serves nearly 90 percent of Americans over 65.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good time to step back and try to make Social Security more effective,\u201d said Richard Johnson of the Urban Institute, author of a new report on raising the program\u2019s retirement age.\\r\\nThe fixes will likely include changes designed to bring more money in and pay less out. Imposing a higher payroll tax or raising the level of earnings subject to Social Security taxes (as of January 1, they will apply to the first $132,900, already an increase) would bolster revenues.\\r\\nMoney-saving measures could include reducing benefits for high earners and trimming the number of years that workers collect benefits by raising eligibility ages. Typically, such changes phase in for younger workers, not those already receiving Social Security or on the cusp of qualifying for benefits.\\r\\nThe demographic imperatives underlying these options are evident. With baby boomers retiring, the system has more beneficiaries to support. Longer life expectancies \u2014 about five additional years over the past several decades \u2014 and improved health have meant that \u201cpeople can certainly work longer than they could in 1960,\u201d Dr. Johnson said.\\r\\nSocial Security now allows workers to claim benefits at age 62, though they\u2019ll receive bigger checks if they wait until their full retirement ages (66 to 67) or beyond. The average monthly payment this year: $1347.46.\\r\\nWorking longer and claiming benefits later \u2014 trends already well underway \u2014 pay off in ways that extend beyond Social Security itself. \u201cIt\u2019s good for people, it\u2019s good for government tax revenues and it could fuel economic growth,\u201d Dr. Johnson said.\\r\\nBut as his report points out, living longer doesn\u2019t always mean people can work longer. Higher-income professionals may opt to stay on the job, he said, but \u201chealth problems are increasingly concentrated among less educated workers and they\u2019re falling further and further behind\u201d economically. Moreover, even those who could work often discover that \u201cemployers don\u2019t seem eager to hire 62 year olds.\u201d\\r\\nBy their early sixties, his analysis of national survey data found, a quarter of high school graduates and 37 percent of those without a high school diploma report work limitations related to their health. Many say their jobs require substantial physical effort.\\r\\nThe Urban Institute report suggests raising the early entitlement age to 65 and the full retirement age to 70, but building in safeguards for those who can\u2019t work, perhaps through Social Security\u2019s other programs.\\r\\nThe agency could provide a safety net by fattening benefits for the very low-income. It could expand its Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, restructure the way its disability insurance works or provide partial benefits for workers who aren\u2019t totally disabled.\\r\\nWhile some think tanks and congressional staffs are exploring ways to strengthen Social Security financially, others are looking into outmoded provisions that penalize beneficiaries, primarily women.\\r\\nSenator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, has introduced legislation intended to help widows, widowers and divorced spouses qualify for higher payments and receive benefits earlier if they\u2019re disabled.\\r\\n\u201cThis bill would boost the incomes of Social Security recipients who are most likely to be living in poverty, the majority of whom are women,\u201d Mr. Casey, ranking member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, said in a statement.\\r\\nSpeaking of women and Social Security, another effort would award work credit for those who temporarily leave the labor force because of caregiving responsibilities.\\r\\nIn the 1930s, when the Social Security Act was passed and then amended, policymakers assumed that women stayed home while men worked. Spousal and survivors benefits represented an attempt to provide for wives (and minor children) who had no work histories of their own.\\r\\n\u201cMajor demographic changes over 80 years have led to fewer women qualifying for spousal benefits,\u201d said Mr. Eschtruth, co-author of a recent international survey of caregiver credits.\\r\\nThe researchers found that 23 percent of Social Security dollars went to spousal and widows\u2019 benefits in 1960, compared to only 11 percent in 2016. That\u2019s partly because a growing proportion of women no longer marry, or have marriages that don\u2019t last 10 years, the threshold to qualify for divorced spouse benefits.\\r\\nIt also reflects the fact that as women have poured into the work force, they may qualify for Social Security retirement benefits based on their own work histories. But because women earn less and are more likely to have spent uncompensated years as caregivers, their retirement benefits can still suffer.\\r\\n\u201cTo what extent does society place a market value on caregiving?\u201d Mr. Eschtruth asked. The answer, at the moment, is that it barely does, at least in the United States.\\r\\nMost other industrialized countries credit some years of caregiving when calculating retirement benefits, the Boston College survey found.

The State Legislature decided that people facing less than six months in jail would have their cases decided by a single judge rather than a jury.\\r\\nThat law has had the unintended effect of depriving immigrants in the city of jury trials for crimes like prostitution and harassment, even though they face the stiff punishment of deportation if convicted, advocates for immigrants said.\\r\\nThis week New York State\u2019s highest court carved out an exception to the law, declaring in a 5-2 decision that noncitizens are entitled to jury trials for deportable offenses under the Sixth Amendment, which guarantees the right to a trial by an impartial jury.\\r\\nImmigrant advocates and civil rights lawyers hailed the ruling as giving all immigrants, not just those charged with serious crimes, an avenue under the Constitution to fight charges that could lead to their removal from the country and permanent separation from their families. But critics said it gave them more rights than citizens have and might lead to bigger backlogs in the criminal courts.\\r\\nBennett L. Gershman, a law professor at Pace University and a former Manhattan prosecutor, called the ruling \u201ca progressive, enlightened decision that puts New York as a court at the forefront of protecting immigrants.\u201d\\r\\nThe question of whether the constitution grants a right to a jury trial to defendants facing deportation for petty crimes has become more important as President\u2019s Trump hard-line immigration policies have gone into effect. Jonathan Lippman, the state\u2019s former chief judge, said the issue would inevitably be one for the Supreme Court to decide.\\r\\nA decision by the nation\u2019s highest court would resonate in eight states, New York City and the District of Columbia, where crimes punishable by less than six months in prison can only be tried by judges. Most other states and jurisdictions give defendants the right to ask for a jury trial regardless of the severity of the charges.\\r\\nJudge Leslie E. Stein said in her opinion for the Court of Appeals majority that deportation is a \u201csufficiently severe penalty\u201d to warrant a jury trial under a standard set by the United States Supreme Court in 1970.\\r\\nThe loss of liberty associated with deportation, Judge Stein wrote, \u201cis analogous to that inherent in incarceration.\u201d And the risk for immigrant defendants of being permanently expelled from the United States and isolated from their families \u201cis frequently more injurious to noncitizen defendants than six months or less of imprisonment.\u201d\\r\\nThe majority on the Court of Appeals followed the reasoning of a court in Washington, D.C., which held in June that a pastor seeking asylum from Burkina Faso had the right to a jury trial on misdemeanor sexual abuse charges because the near-certainty of his deportation elevated the crime to a serious offense.\\r\\nJudge Michael J. Garcia countered in a dissent that courts should defer to the State Legislature in determining the seriousness of a crime, not to federal immigration law. And Justice Rowan D. Wilson added in another dissent that if the prospect of deportation triggered the right to a jury trial, \u201cthe entire federal system of removal of undocumented aliens is unconstitutional.\u201d\\r\\nThe ruling granted a new trial for Saylor Suazo, an immigrant from Honduras who remained in the United States after his visa expired. He was convicted of assault and harassment in 2012, after Bronx prosecutors said he threw his children\u2019s mother to the floor, choked her and punched her in the head and neck.\\r\\nMr. Suazo initially faced up to a year in jail, but just before trial, prosecutors reduced the charges so that he could be tried by a judge instead of a jury. Prosecutors commonly use the maneuver to speed up cases.\\r\\nDarcel D. Clark, the Bronx district attorney, predicted the ruling would create \u201cserious backlogs and disparities in the administration of justice, for the courts of this state.\u201d She said she was considering an appeal to the Supreme Court.\\r\\nBut Lucian Chalfen, the spokesman for the Office of Court Administration, said the impact of the ruling on court operations remained to be seen. Only 675 misdemeanor cases went to trial last year in New York City and 470 were decided by judges, Mr. Chalfen said. It\u2019s unclear how many of those trials involved immigrants, who make up about 40 percent of the city\u2019s 8.6 million residents. City demographers estimate that 500,000 of them are undocumented.\\r\\nMark W.

They all have a few things in common: a slight bitterness and a bright-red color. And bugs.\\r\\nYes, bugs. Many of these drinks use the natural dye carmine, which is extracted from the cochineal, a tiny insect, to achieve their vibrant hue. This is not some weird new craft-distilling trend: Cochineals (KAHCH-i-neels), native to the Americas, have been used for centuries to lend color to everything from fabric to cosmetics to food.\\r\\nFor decades, Campari was the most famous spirit to use crushed cochineals for coloring. The company decided in 2006 to discontinue its use in most of its bottlings, in favor of artificial colors, because of what it called the \u201cuncertainty of supply of the natural colorant.\u201d That would have seemed to be a death knell for the insect\u2019s future in liquor.\\r\\nIndeed, when Todd Leopold, head distiller of the Denver spirits company Leopold Bros., decided to make an aperitivo a few years ago, the main argument against cochineal was that \u201cnobody was using it,\u201d he said. \u201cCampari had stopped.\u201d\\r\\nNow, Mr. Leopold and a number of other craft distillers are going all in on cochineal. Its use may not sit well with certain groups, like vegans and those who keep kosher. But the spirit-makers contend that it\u2019s a better alternative to artificial dyes, most of which are derived from petroleum.\\r\\n\u201cGiven the option of petroleum byproduct and smushed-up bugs, the bugs won out,\u201d said Lance Winters, master distiller at St. George Spirits in Alameda, Calif., which uses cochineal in its Bruto Americano.\\r\\nThough the idea of drinking insect-tinted liquor may sound unappetizing, the dye is, after all, natural. \u201cWe try to do nothing that is not natural,\u201d said Francesco Amodeo, the president of Don Ciccio & Figli, in Washington. \u201cThe artificial dye will give you a funky taste all the way to the back.\u201d \\r\\nCochineal lends no aroma or flavor, and its use is traditional \u2014 something that appeals to craft distillers, a breed known for their allegiance to historical practices. \u201cWhy would you change tradition when it\u2019s been done that way for centuries?\u201d Mr. Amodeo asked.\\r\\nThe distillers go to some pains to follow that custom. Mr. Amodeo spent three years seeking a good source for cochineal, a search that held back the release of his aperitivo, called Cinque. He eventually found it in Peru and Bolivia. \\r\\nCochineal typically comes in either liquid or powdered form. A small amount (for St. George Spirits, a fraction of a gram per liter of alcohol) is needed to turn a distillate scarlet. The Food and Drug Administration requires that manufacturers who use cochineal or carmine say so on the label.\\r\\nGiven all this fuss, you might ask: Why do these aperitivos have to be red, anyway? Again, the answer seems to be tradition: It has always been done that way.\\r\\nAperitivos, Mr. Amodeo pointed out, are typically \u201csipped toward early afternoon until sunset. It kind of reflects the time of day. Amaros, which are darker, are for late night.\u201d\\r\\nSome distillers report a little resistance to their use of cochineal. \u201cThere are some stores that won\u2019t carry it because they don\u2019t want that kind of thing in the products that are selling,\u201d Mr. Winters said. \\r\\nJohn Troia, a founder of Tempus Fugit Spirits, in San Francisco, uses cochineal in two products. He finds it curious that people would object to imbibing insects.\\r\\n\u201cThe funny thing is, alcohol is technically a poison to the body,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the focus is a little odd, the things people fixate on.\u201d\\r\\n\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1513850193,\"description\":\"Campari stopped using a traditional dye made from insects, but makers of American aperitivos are taking it back up.\\r\",\"title\":\"The Secret to That Bright-Red Drink?

But while there is certainly a shortage of qualified mechanics, it seems unlikely that dealerships will need more than 2,500 of them.\\r\\n\u201cI think we have to view with suspicion plans to retrain employees, because we\u2019ve heard that story before,\u201d Scott Aquanno, a political scientist at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, who has studied previous G.M. layoffs, told me. \u201cThe opportunities for high-paying jobs are slim.\u201d\\r\\nAnd while Oshawa, like many Canadian cities, is trying to turn itself into a hub for technology industries, Mr. Aquanno said even if that effort is successful, it\u2019s unlikely to help many G.M. workers.\\r\\nBeyond retraining, Mr. Ford has asked Mr. Trudeau to extend federal jobless benefits by five weeks: a measure likely welcomed by workers, but well short of a solution.\\r\\nThe Oshawa shutdown doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Canada\u2019s auto industry as a whole is doomed \u2014 at least, not immediately.

For her and 10 other older community members, ranging in age from 80 to 104, attending the weekly church service is a way to preserve the history of the early African-American settlers,  passed down through songs and the English language.  It is a history that many fear will be forgotten. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThe church is where I go to praise God and preserve my family\u2019s story,\u201d Ms. Wilmore said from the living room of her home in the Wilmore neighborhood, established by her great-grandparents. \\r\\nInside St. Peter\u2019s Evangelical Church, the oldest church in town that was founded by the settlers, a group of children sang \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d in front of a crowd filled with congregants who sang along while wearing an assortment of white outfits.  \\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful story and if they don\u2019t know it, it will get lost,\u201d said the Rev. Jerlin Feliz Diaz, 45, pastor at St. Peter\u2019s Church.\\r\\nThe history is rich, beginning in the early 1800s when President Jean-Pierre Boyer, one of the leaders of the Haitian Revolution, used land and resources to lure black Americans, many who were freed slaves, to the island that he and his compatriots had just overtaken.  in 1824, Rev. Richard Allen, an A.M.E. Church pastor, led a group to the region, according to Ryan Mann-Hamilton, an anthropology professor at LaGuardia Community College and a descendant of those immigrants. \\r\\nThe Haitian control of the island has been recalled by some Dominicans as a brutal period, complicating the community\u2019s relationship with its new neighbors. The town of Samana, where the African-American community settled though, was geographically isolated, further insulating them from Dominican society, complicating issues of identity and acceptance on the island. \\r\\nThe relocation to the Dominican Republic came during a back to Africa movement for black people in the United States, Professor Mann-Hamilton said. Some estimates claim that as many as 6,000 African-Americans migrated throughout the island and as many as 13,000 went to West African countries like Liberia and Sierra Leone.\\r\\n\u201cThere was a large issue dealing with what to do with freed black people during this time period,\u201d Professor Mann-Hamilton said. \\r\\nAll passengers on that original ship to Samana obtained their freedom by escaping the slave-owning South or by purchasing their own freedom papers. They hailed from A.M.E. churches in the South and throughout the Eastern Seaboard and had surnames like Sheppard, Hamilton, Wilmore and King, which continue to be common throughout the port town.\\r\\nEstablishing a viable church became the focus of the group in 1824. African-American cultural practices have been preserved through the weekly church activities, which continue today. English was spoken in homes and in schools established by the churches, and other culinary and cultural traditions were passed along, like gingerbread and \u201cjohnny cakes,\u201d a cornmeal flatbread. \\r\\nIn 1930, however, the use of English was stigmatized by President Rafael Trujillo, a brutal dictator. He began a process to \u201cHispanicize\u201d the entire nation by implementing Spanish-only laws in the region, which he enforced through tactics like physical violence and imprisonment. He closed down English-speaking schools and exhibited violence toward any religious or cultural practices that had roots in African tradition. For the settlers, a black migrant group brought in by Haitians, a culture and community was at risk.\\r\\n\u201cHis people banned us from speaking the language we had grown up speaking,\u201d said Franklin Wilmore, 75, a local music instructor and weekly A.M.E. church attendee. Many people in the community who only spoke English and had to learn Spanish, developed a hybrid \u201cSpanglish\u201d language in the meantime. \\r\\nIn 1979, things changed when cruise ships starting arriving in Samana. Ricardo Barrett Green, 64, who grew up speaking English before the ban, was one of the first descendants to get hired by Carnival Cruises to translate for English-speaking tourists.\\r\\nHe remembers his first day on the job at age 18, \u201cI was alone with 50 white people who were staring at me and I didn\u2019t know what to do, so I began to sing a church song that I knew in English: \u2018I\u2019m up on the mountain and I will not come down! I\u2019m up on the mountain and I will not come down,\u2019\u201d he said, laughing while recalling the experience. \u201cThey loved my performance and everyone clapped. I came back the next day and sang more songs and eventually learned how to be a good tour guide.\u201d\\r\\nConnecting to the music and songs of their black American ancestors has been important to the community. Lincoln Phipps, 86, a retired music instructor and member of St. Peter\u2019s, grew up playing the trumpet in the church and continued as an adult. He doesn\u2019t play in church anymore, but he plays his trumpet and sings gospel songs like \u201cGod Will Take Care of You\u201d at home for his wife. Mr. Wilmore now teaches music composition as well as African-American spiritual hymns he learned as a child to school-age children.\\r\\nMs. Wilmore and many of the descendants of the 1824 wave of African-Americans, have a complicated definition of their Dominican identity.  While they were born in Samana, and in many ways feel Dominican, they acknowledge their roots in African-American history and have yearned to connect with distant relatives in the United States.\\r\\n\u201cSinging with African-Americans has been one of the greatest experiences for me,\u201d Ms. Wilmore said, describing her experience traveling to Atlanta several times to participate in A.M.E. church events. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt more connected to black people in the U.S. than in the Dominican Republic.\u201d\\r\\nOthers, however, have not been able to travel to the United States. When the African-American settlers arrived in Samana in 1824, the government gave many of them medals to distinguish themselves as Americans. The medals were intended to both celebrate their arrival and were initially told that it would allow them to return to the United States.

There was no response. \\r\\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way to identify our history,\u201d Mr. Benjamin said. \u201cThere\u2019s no statue or official order or cultural center.\u201d\\r\\nZoila Henriquez, 46, Pastor Diaz's wife and an active member of the St. Peter\u2019s Church, is leading an initiative to preserve the historical documents that are stored in a black suitcase inside the church.

He\u2019d crumple a sheet, uncrumple it, stare into its depths, and think, \u201cThere must be something that would make all this mess look a little less messy.\u201d\\r\\nCrumple, uncrumple, crumple. Sheet after sheet landed in the recycling bin, each one blank but for its chaotically creased geography. In time, a semblance of order emerged.\\r\\nCrumpled wads of paper are no doubt as old and commonplace as paper itself \u2014 \u201cgraves for failed theories,\u201d Mr. Gottesman, a physicist, has called them. But for him, the crumpled paper itself was the research.\\r\\nThe dynamics of crumpling are in play everywhere: in the initial unfolding of an insect\u2019s wing; in the way DNA packs into a cell nucleus, in the challenge of how best to cram a giant solar sail into a small satellite so that it unfurls successfully. Scientists, in turn, devote considerable energy to deciphering, and trying to reduce, this complexity and disorder. Paper is an ideal model.\\r\\n\u201cDespite the apparent ease with which sheets of paper are crumpled and tossed away, crumpling dynamics are often considered a paradigm of complexity,\u201d Mr. Gottesman noted in a research paper published earlier this month in the journal Communications Physics. \\r\\n\u201cOne of the key assumptions physicists make is that there are some universal properties that are shared between many disordered complicated systems,\u201d he said recently. \u201cStudying one complicated system could teach us a lot about other systems as well.\u201d\\r\\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\\r\\nAn unfolding history\\r\\nThe British conceptual artist Martin Creed once said, \u201cI feel like you can have a microcosm of the world in a work.\u201d He achieved as much with his 1995 creation, \u201cWork No. 88,\u201d a single piece of A4 paper crumpled into a ball. Within that crinkled sphere \u2014 like a tectonically wonky planet seen from afar \u2014 Creed wrangled complexity and chaos, deformation and disorder.\\r\\nAs did, that same year, two French physicists at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris, Martine Ben Amar and Yves Pomeau, with a three-page journal article, \u201cPapier froiss\u00e9.\u201d In it they introduced the atom of paper crumpling, the d-cone: the tip of the cone that forms when you place a piece of paper over a cup and press into it with a pencil. (A crumpled ball is a collection of d-cones connected by ridges.)\\r\\n\u201cPapier froiss\u00e9\u201d was followed by a 26-page English version, \u201cCrumpled paper.\u201d The authors concluded by wondering if the same topological ideas about curvature might apply to general relativity.\\r\\nSo began an early chapter in the physics and mathematics of crumpled paper. And now the latest advancement arrives with Mr. Gottesman\u2019s recent contribution, \u201cA state variable for crumpled thin sheets,\u201d which proposed that crumpling dynamics may not be hopelessly complex after all.\\r\\n\u201cThe surprising thing about the result is that it\u2019s very, very simple,\u201d said Shmuel M. Rubinstein, a physicist and the study\u2019s principal investigator, although he emphasized that Mr. Gottesman did most of the work. \u201cWhat Omer showed is that perhaps the most important aspect of a phenomenon that\u2019s considered to be really chaotic \u2014 a paradigm of disorder and complexity and uncertainty, like the butterfly-flapping-its-wings metaphor \u2014 is remarkably predictable, deterministic and simple.\u201d\\r\\nHow to \u2018kvetch\u2019 paper\\r\\nThe methodology was straightforward, anyway. In the lab, Mr. Gottesman crushed hundreds of sheets of paper in a cylindrical container. This was scientific paper, elastoplastic Mylar sheets, which were less likely to inflict paper cuts, or to wilt into a tissue when subjected to repeated crumpling.\\r\\nSome early trial runs, posted on his website as \u201cfun paper stuff,\u201d involved \u201ckvetching\u201d a vertical tube of paper with an empty coffee can. (\u201cKvetch,\u201d a Yiddish word that usually means \u201ccomplain\u201d but translates literally as \u201csqueeze\u201d or \u201cpress,\u201d became a term of endearment around the lab, as stacks of paper complained about their fate.)\\r\\nLike a palm reader intuiting a life line, Mr. Gottesman analyzed the creases of the crumpled paper and sought to tease out a variable, an equation, a law \u2014 something that predicted what would occur with the next crumple.\\r\\nHe toyed with a number of variables: the range of individual crease lengths; the distances between creases; the largest patch without creases; the sharpness of creases, and the amount of energy needed to cause crumpling.\\r\\nFrom one crumple to the next, he observed that a piece of paper never stopped forming new creases, although the rate of their formation slowed logarithmically. With each new crumple, the paper creased along some of its existing scars, but there always came a point when new creases were needed for crumpling to continue.\\r\\n\u201cIn the lab, I crumpled as many as 70 times,\u201d Mr. Gottesman said. \u201cUsually after four or five times you can\u2019t really easily see a difference between one crumple to the next.\u201d\\r\\nHe did, however, notice a trend involving the cumulative total length of all creases on a sheet after each crumple. In the lab, this variable was called \u201cthe mileage.\u201d\\r\\nAs Mr. Gottesman crumpled, he scanned each sheet into his computer, and then, with an algorithm, he measured the sum total of all the creases. He found that if he crumpled two separate sheets, each sheet would, as expected, accumulate damage in a unique way. But the total crease lengths of the two sheets stayed remarkably similar. Length seemed to be a deterministic variable, a so-called state variable, predicting how the network of creases would evolve.\\r\\n\u201cThe detailed history of the crumpling dynamics is written into the intricate pattern of creases,\u201d Mr. Gottesman and his co-authors wrote. \u201cNo two crumpled sheets are identical.\u201d\\r\\nAnd yet the paper is effectively devoid of memory. At each state of crumple, the intricate crease patterns, and the events that led to them, are irrelevant. All that is needed to predict the paper\u2019s next state is the total length of creases in the current one. \u201cYou just care about the current state,\u201d Mr. Gottesman said. \\r\\nA single-state philosophy\\r\\nThe news that crumpled paper obeys a state variable \u2014 or a crease law, or a damage law \u2014 has been received in the academy with wonderment and delight, since, as the authors noted, it represented \u201ca remarkable reduction in complexity.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cThe idea that crumpling can be characterized by as simple a quantity as the length of creases is extremely interesting,\u201d said Dr. Ben Amar. \u201cIt will be marvelous if this experimental work is continued by a theoretical treatment\u201d \u2014 that is, with equations derived from the laws of elasticity.\\r\\nThomas Witten, a physicist at the University of Chicago, found the result striking and puzzling. \u201cIt could prove very exciting,\u201d he said. Witten\u2019s research has shown that every material crumples in roughly the same way \u2014 a tectonic plate, a cell membrane, the graphene in a Buckyball, the fabric of Mona Lisa\u2019s right sleeve as depicted by Leonardo da Vinci, which, for Dr. Witten, folds in a way reminiscent of the human ear.\\r\\nFor Dr. Rubinstein, the damage law is inspiring. It suggests that other complex phenomena might reveal themselves in a comparable way \u2014 \u201csystems that are more mysterious, where you can\u2019t so easily see the scarring and the breakage,\u201d he said. For instance, why do different proteins fold so reliably into similar shapes, and under what conditions do they fail to fold?\\r\\nWith paper, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re doing something very arbitrary. We\u2019re crumpling, flattening, crumpling, flattening. Basically, we are just cycling the system.\u201d Many systems, including the human body, work the same way, he said.\\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at how damage and defects are accumulating, and that is a big question in materials science and in engineering. When will something break? How it will break? These are the most uncertain statistical things in nature. We are helpless against them. But at least for the crumpled paper, it seems like nature is transcending this uncertainty.\u201d\\r\\nThe demise of paper has been predicted for some time now, but paper, it seems, may not be done with us. Paper defies history, in more ways than one. Its scars and creases may even hold a potential philosophy.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good metaphor,\u201d Dr. Rubinstein said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s really hard to imagine that the future depends only on the current situation. We are such a strong function of our history \u2014 personal history, global history, whatnot. It is really counterintuitive to say, Well, our future really only depends on our current state of mind, and not how it developed, how we got to this point.\\r\\n\u201cWe have the same intuition for any complex system: that its evolution is something very strongly dependent on many points in time, many degrees of freedom, and you have to know so many of them.

But the account of the meeting provided no indication that the central bank is preparing to pause, notwithstanding the hopes of investors and frequent public attacks by President Trump.\\r\\n\u201cAlmost all participants expressed the view that another increase in the target range for the federal funds rate was likely to be warranted fairly soon,\u201d barring unpleasant developments, the minutes said.\\r\\nThe Fed\u2019s policy arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, last raised its benchmark rate in September, to a range of 2 percent to 2.25 percent, then left the rate unchanged at the November meeting. The central bank is widely expected to increase the rate by a quarter of a percentage point in December.\\r\\nThe stock market surged on Wednesday after investors interpreted a speech by the Fed\u2019s chairman, Jerome H. Powell, as an indication that the central bank may leave rates closer to the current level. The minutes, however, contained no hint of any such shift in plans at the time of the meeting. Analysts said they were skeptical that the Fed meant to signal a change on Wednesday.\\r\\nPaul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics, said that the market had overreacted, and that the minutes \u201cdo not suggest that Fed officials anticipated an imminent pause in the tightening cycle.\u201d He said he expected a rate increase in December and two more during the first half of 2019.\\r\\nThe market\u2019s reaction on Thursday was much more subdued, with the S&P 500 index closing down 0.2 percent.\\r\\nThe Fed is seeking to wean markets from the expectation that it would continue to raise its benchmark rate every quarter. A rate increase in December would be the fifth straight quarterly increase.\\r\\nThe account emphasized that the central bank\u2019s policy \u201cwas not on a preset course,\u201d a phrase Mr. Powell also has used in recent remarks. The minutes said the Fed might remove language that predicts \u201cfurther gradual increases\u201d from its next policy statement to underscore the point that officials will make decisions based on the latest data. But the central bank also said most officials expect \u201cfurther gradual increases.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Trump has loudly complained that the Fed is throttling growth by raising rates. He renewed his attacks earlier this week, insisting in a pair of interviews that the Fed\u2019s march toward higher rates posed a significant threat to the economy.\\r\\nSome economists agree with Mr. Trump that the Fed should take a break from raising rates, noting that there is little sign that the economy is in danger of overheating. The Commerce Department reported on Thursday that a key measure of inflation rose by 1.78 percent over the 12 months ending in October, below the 2 percent annual pace that the central bank regards as optimal.\\r\\n\u201cThe Fed\u2019s mandate is price stability, and price growth has actually slowed,\u201d Jason Furman, a Harvard economist who was chairman of President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why wages and prices are moving in different directions, it is very plausible that price growth will pick up again. But I don\u2019t see much cost to a pause while we figure it out.\u201d\\r\\nLawrence Summers, who served as Mr. Obama\u2019s chief economic adviser, also has urged caution. In an interview with Fox Business Network scheduled to air on Friday, Mr. Summers said he disapproved of the way Mr. Trump was expressing his concerns, but he agreed with the substance. \u201cI do think that there are more risks of overtightening than there are of under-tightening right now,\u201d he said.\\r\\nMr. Powell has said that the central bank is moving forward with rate increases because the economy is in good health, and that the Fed is trying to strike a balance between allowing the current expansion to continue and ensuring that inflation remains under control.\\r\\nThe economy grew at a 3.5 percent annualized pace in the third quarter, job growth is strong and wages are rising, buttressing the intentions of Fed officials to continue raising rates.\\r\\nBut the minutes noted \u201csome signs of slowing in interest-sensitive sectors\u201d like housing and car sales and said that \u201cconditions remain depressed\u201d in the agricultural sector because of trade tensions.\\r\\nFed officials at the November meeting also reviewed a change in the mechanics of monetary policy that the central bank adopted after the 2008 financial crisis.\\r\\nBefore the crisis, the Fed raised interest rates by draining reserves from the banking system. During the crisis, the Fed purchased trillions of dollars in Treasuries and mortgage bonds, which it paid for by pumping reserves into the banking system. The Fed could have reversed the process before raising rates. Instead, it chose to raise rates in a new way, by paying banks to leave reserves untouched.\\r\\nThe Fed is slowly reducing its bond holdings, and officials are debating whether to slash them to a level that would allow a return to the pre-crisis system. The account of the November meeting said officials were pleased with the new system, which has increased the Fed\u2019s control over financial and economic conditions, but made no final decision.\\r\\nOfficials did approve a small tweak. Under the new approach, the Fed aims to keep its benchmark rate near the midpoint of a quarter-point range. Initially, the interest rate the Fed paid banks on reserves was set at the top of the range.\\r\\nBut earlier this year, the Fed set the interest rate on reserves 0.05 percentage point below the top of the range, to help keep the benchmark rate closer to the middle of the range. That has been insufficient, and Fed officials approved a further reduction, if necessary before the December meeting, according to the minutes.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-384065564,\"description\":\"The minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s most recent meeting said most officials foresee a need to keep raising rates next year.\\r\",\"title\":\"Interest Rates Likely to Rise in December, Recap of Fed Meeting Shows\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"business.28.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"When Paul Polman was made chief executive of Unilever in 2009, he was regarded as a safe choice to lead the maker of Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise, Dove soap and Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream.

He rolled out a long-term strategy to make Unilever a better steward of the environment and a more socially responsible business, known as the Sustainable Living Plan.\\r\\nIn time, Mr. Polman, who is Dutch, began acquiring brands known for their ecological bona fides, like Seventh Generation and Tazo tea. And last year, he fended off a takeover attempt by Kraft Heinz, a deal that would have been a near-term win for investors but would have set up a clash of diametrically opposed corporate cultures.\\r\\nAs Unilever\u2019s chief, Mr. Polman emerged as one of the most prominent voices in the corporate world calling for changes to the status quo, encouraging big companies to reduce emissions, embrace renewable energy, improve conditions for workers and produce healthier products.\\r\\nHe served on a United Nations panel that created the Sustainable Development Goals. And in 2015, he was among the most prominent business leaders calling for world leaders to commit to the Paris climate accord.\\r\\n\u201cThere\u2019s been no one as clear and focused and all-in as Paul Polman in setting goals for his company, his supply chain and taking his words on the road,\u201d said Mindy Lubber, chief executive of Ceres, a nonprofit group that advocates for sustainable business. \u201cHis voice has made a difference.

Mr. Jope, a Scotsman, once appeared as a judge on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d with Donald J.

And the people and brands who have joined us have come because of the Sustainable Living Plan.\u201d\\r\\nBut as Mr. Polman departs, some wonder whether Unilever will continue to promote corporate responsibility, especially as consumer goods makers struggle with lagging sales, rising costs from tariffs and new competition from companies like Amazon.\\r\\n\u201cPaul has been a crucial voice for a more ethical and sustainable form of capitalism,\u201d said Aron Cramer, chief executive of Business for Social Responsibility, a trade group. \u201cBut consumer products companies are going through choppy waters. It will be essential that the board maintain its commitment to his vision.\u201d\\r\\nWhen Mr. Polman first took over at Unilever, financial analysts were skeptical of his new direction. During his first few months, which coincided with the financial crisis, Unilever\u2019s stock plummeted more than 27 percent. When he abolished quarterly guidance, shares fell 8 percent.\\r\\nBut since then, Unilever\u2019s stock price has shot up, more than doubling during Mr. Polman\u2019s tenure.\\r\\nMr. Polman managed to deliver strong financial results by acquiring new brands, expanding in emerging markets and enlarging the company\u2019s personal care business. At the same time, he championed the Sustainable Living Plan, which set ambitious goals such as cutting Unilever\u2019s environmental impact in half by 2030, while still improving sales.\\r\\nTo accomplish this, Mr. Polman gave managers wide latitude to make changes that could reduce water use and greenhouse gas emissions, improve soil health and create less waste.\\r\\nThe company has been transparent about its progress, issuing annual reports detailing its efforts, including improving working conditions in its supply chain and creating healthier products. For example, Unilever says that carbon dioxide emissions from its factories are down 47 percent from 2008 levels.\\r\\nBut success has been uneven. Unilever\u2019s push to use sustainable soy beans in Iowa to create a better mayonnaise has been inordinately complicated. And it notes that it is having a hard time meeting its goal of sourcing all agricultural raw materials sustainably by 2020. Last year, that figure was at just 56 percent.\\r\\nAnd while Mr. Polman has overseen strong, sustained growth at Unilever in recent years, his tenure hasn\u2019t been entirely smooth.\\r\\nThe bid from Kraft Heinz, whose board then included Warren E. Buffett, offered Unilever shareholders a roughly 18 percent premium to their stock. But Mr. Polman argued that Unilever would be worth more over the long term, and Kraft Heinz withdrew its offer.\\r\\nIn the aftermath, investors looked to Mr. Polman to improve profits and streamline the company, including an effort to reduce bureaucracy by doing away with a dual listing structure that includes two headquarters, in London and Rotterdam.\\r\\nIn March, Unilever announced it would make the Netherlands its sole headquarters, dealing a symbolic and economic blow to Britain in the wake of the Brexit vote. But such a move would have forced Unilever to leave the FTSE 100 stock index, in turn forcing several large mutual funds to sell their holdings. In October, Mr. Polman backtracked on the plan.\\r\\nOn Thursday, Mr. Polman said his effort to unite the company was among his greatest priorities in his last year on the job, but with the effort having faltered, he believed it was time to retire.\\r\\n\u201cI tried to do the job of unification, but it was a difficult environment,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the ship is steadied.

Driving around L.A. is scary even for very experienced adult drivers. Does a 16-year-old boy, whose navigation skills are limited to the internet, have the judgment, attention span and ability to process a dozen different inputs simultaneously necessary to avoid an accident?\\r\\nMind you, learning to drive was not my grandson\u2019s idea, but his parents are tired of chauffeuring the kids everywhere, and options to walk, cycle or take public transportation, which suited my 18-year-old grandsons in New York City just fine, are lacking where they live.\\r\\nIf I could make the rules, no one under 20 would be behind the wheel of a motor vehicle without an experienced licensed adult in the passenger seat. Even compared to 18-year-olds, the brain of a 20-year-old is more mature and less likely to succumb to risk-taking. Crash investigations have shown that \u201cthe cause of teenage crashes is not the skill with which they can drive, but the judgment they exercise while driving,\u201d according to an editorial in the Journal of Adolescent Health. \\r\\nAlthough the number of teenagers killed in motor vehicle crashes has dropped by almost 50 percent in the last decade, crashes remain the leading cause of adolescent death and injury in the United States. And since 2014, along with the use of electronic devices, teenage motor vehicle fatalities have risen, according to a new policy statement by the American Academy of Pediatrics.\\r\\nA recent study, published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, found that new teenage drivers were eight times more likely to crash or have a close call in the first three months after getting a license and driving independently than they were during the last three months on a learner\u2019s permit. New teen drivers were also four times more likely to engage in risky behaviors like rapid acceleration, sudden braking and hard turns, the study, led by Bruce G. Simons-Morton of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, found.\\r\\nAlthough driver education helps students pass a licensing examination, there is little evidence that it produces safer drivers. As the pediatrics statement noted, \u201cStudies consistently reveal no safety effect associated with traditional driver education.\u201d\\r\\nGraduated driver licensing policies, now nationwide for new drivers under 18, can help to reduce crash rates by requiring a specific number of hours of adult-supervised driving, restrictions on driving at night and with peers in the car, and phasing in exposure to more demanding driving conditions.\\r\\n\u201cThese laws can reduce fatalities among 16- and 17-year-old drivers, but they\u2019re not well-enforced, and the rates go up once kids turn 18,\u201d said Dr. Brian D. Johnston, co-author with Dr. Elizabeth M. Alderman of the new policy statement.\\r\\nBut even when graduated license policies are enforced, Dr. Simons-Morton\u2019s research showed, \u201ccrash rates are dramatically high in the early months of independent driving.\u201d As he and his co-authors pointed out, \u201cIt may take only a few hours behind the wheel for most novices to develop reasonable vehicle management skills, but safe driving judgment, as with all complex activities, comes only with experience.\u201d\\r\\nTherein lies the Catch-22: New drivers are more likely to get into trouble because they lack experience, but the best way to reduce the risk of a crash is to become an experienced driver. Dr. Alderman, an adolescent medicine specialist at Montefiore Medical Center, suggested in an interview that even after a teenager is licensed to drive independently, wise parents can mitigate risks by continuing to supervise driving in a variety of venues until teen drivers are more experienced.\\r\\nActually, the parents\u2019 role in rearing safe drivers starts long before children can see over the steering wheel. \u201cParents need to be role models,\u201d Dr. Alderman said. \u201cAlways fasten seatbelts, never text while driving, and never drink alcohol or smoke weed and then get behind the wheel.\u201d To which I would add, parents should model safe driving habits by not speeding, tailgating or cutting in and out of traffic.\\r\\nThese days the most common risk facing young drivers involves distracting devices. A mere four seconds with eyes off the road vastly increases the chance of an accident. Using camcorders, the Teen Safe Driver Program revealed that three-fourths of moderate-to-severe rear-end crashes among teen drivers involved distracting behaviors, most often the use of cellphones. The teenage driver showed no response to the impending crash in half of cases in which the driver was using a phone. \\r\\n\u201cTeenage drivers have the highest rate of distraction-related fatal crashes of all other age groups,\u201d Dr. Simons-Morton reported. And the temptations keep growing, with in-vehicle information and entertainment technologies and portable electronic devices of which teens are usually the earliest adopters.\\r\\n\u201cThere are three kinds of distractions: visual, cognitive and manual,\u201d Dr. Johnston said. \u201cElectronic technology is all three of these, and the risk of a crash goes way up.\u201d\\r\\nAlthough alcohol as a factor in teen driving fatalities has declined in recent decades, \u201cthe use of alcohol by an adolescent driver remains a serious risk factor for motor vehicle crashes and resultant fatalities,\u201d the pediatrics report states. In 2015, 16 percent of teenage drivers involved in fatal crashes had a blood alcohol level of 0.08 percent or higher, and 64 percent who were killed in alcohol-involved crashes were not wearing seatbelts.\\r\\nAll states now have a \u201czero-tolerance\u201d law stating that a blood alcohol level of 0.02 percent or more for young drivers constitutes drunken driving and can result in an automatic suspension or loss of their license.\\r\\nSleep deprivation is becoming a more common risk factor for crashes by teenage drivers. Insufficient sleep not only increases the risk of falling asleep at the wheel, it impairs attention and judgment. Schools and parents can do more to assure that teenagers get enough sleep.\\r\\nParents should also think twice about the cars teens are driving. Though the tendency may be to provide an old car lest a new one get banged up, teens may be better off with a newer vehicle equipped with the latest safety features, like signals for lane departures and approaching vehicles and self-braking in an impending crash. Dr. Johnston suggests that parents \u201cpick the safest, most up-to-date car you can afford.\u201d \\r\\nParents might also consider creating a teen-driving contract that spells out the expectations, responsibilities and risks for the teen driver. The pediatrics society offers a prototype contract under the teen section of its website, healthychildren.org. \",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":252720659,\"description\":\"New drivers are more likely to get into trouble because they lack experience, but the best way to reduce the risk of a crash is to become an experienced driver.\\r\",\"title\":\"Personal Health: Helping Teenagers to Be Safer Drivers\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"health.31.txt\"}],\"labelMap\":[[61447848,\"technology\"],[-2095820065,\"science\"],[1019667238,\"science\"],[1931849565,\"world\"],[1078252366,\"business\"],[400461459,\"business\"],[-1869905367,\"science\"],[-580549357,\"business\"],[-592673859,\"business\"],[1700442999,\"world\"],[-528635622,\"business\"],[621865068,\"business\"],[659434478,\"business\"],[1868053907,\"science\"],[-2031516889,\"technology\"],[-1233719476,\"business\"],[1131488870,\"health\"],[472079094,\"business\"],[275771711,\"business\"],[-1872930463,\"health\"],[2048410531,\"world\"],[-589719920,\"health\"],[-858981003,\"technology\"],[879478674,\"world\"],[2013679192,\"business\"],[1866762071,\"business\"],[-234078885,\"health\"],[-1578760496,\"business\"],[1290383668,\"world\"],[-1435074447,\"business\"],[-691696041,\"business\"],[-1729538882,\"business\"],[-223316604,\"world\"],[298995085,\"world\"],[1112125808,\"business\"],[771271037,\"health\"],[-78975018,\"business\"],[201578773,\"world\"],[39893877,\"world\"],[-51772054,\"health\"],[-2112452557,\"world\"],[-864051157,\"business\"],[625140182,\"business\"],[-1464142267,\"science\"],[-158803391,\"world\"],[-1873518404,\"technology\"],[-1299341993,\"science\"],[1042698165,\"business\"],[-1443018166,\"business\"],[-1843556299,\"science\"],[768893525,\"science\"],[-1199322431,\"world\"],[1195195447,\"business\"],[-1564664983,\"technology\"],[352454400,\"world\"],[532103020,\"technology\"],[1661884965,\"world\"],[-935213790,\"science\"],[1589159170,\"world\"],[-426621666,\"business\"],[-287299375,\"business\"],[399409751,\"business\"],[828589321,\"technology\"],[1061430478,\"world\"],[-444927975,\"business\"],[-1205115319,\"business\"],[123527019,\"business\"],[-1402549333,\"business\"],[-701746304,\"world\"],[-1031464528,\"world\"],[1323316867,\"business\"],[1477094603,\"science\"],[1837631011,\"world\"],[1968119106,\"technology\"],[2146958515,\"health\"],[75715423,\"business\"],[-1319101008,\"business\"],[-1440212449,\"world\"],[-1396857189,\"business\"],[1350232188,\"health\"],[1901922323,\"world\"],[1513850193,\"world\"],[1367962832,\"health\"],[-419302478,\"science\"],[1443226727,\"world\"],[-384065564,\"business\"],[-1632598674,\"world\"],[-1181703224,\"health\"],[252720659,\"business\"]],\"confusionMatrix\":[[9,2,0,2,6],[10,3,1,0,5],[7,1,2,4,5],[4,1,3,2,3],[6,3,5,0,5]],\"confusionLabels\":[\"business\",\"health\",\"science\",\"technology\",\"world\"],\"relabelingLabelMap\":[],\"accuracy\":0.23595505617977527,\"correctRelabeled\":[],\"labelingPrecision\":null,\"labelingRecall\":0,\"correctAssignedItems\":[],\"assignmentPrecision\":null,\"openedItems\":[],\"numOpenedItems\":0,\"selectedItems\":[2013679192,-1233719476,472079094,621865068,1019667238,-287299375,1661884965,-1402549333,2146958515,-1181703224,252720659],\"selectedInCategory\":10,\"selectionRecall\":0.5263157894736842},{\"modelOperation\":\"add\",\"changedFiles\":[{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"(Want to get this briefing by email?

Here\u2019s a look at some of the central claims \u2014 and the common misconceptions \u2014 in that debate.\\r\\nCutting down trees is always bad for the environment. (False.)\\r\\nDon\u2019t feel bad about cutting down a tree for the holiday. Christmas trees are crops grown on farms, like lettuce or corn. They are not cut down from wild forests on a large scale, said Bert Cregg, an expert in Christmas tree production and forestry at Michigan State University.\\r\\nA five- or six-foot tree takes just under a decade to grow, and once it\u2019s cut down, the farmer will generally plant at least one in its place. The trees provide many benefits to the environment as they grow, cleaning the air and providing watersheds and habitats for wildlife. They grow best on rolling hills that are often unsuitable for other crops and, of course, they are biodegradable.\\r\\nOregon is the country\u2019s biggest grower, followed by North Carolina. Many other states also have sizable Christmas tree farms, which preserve open land from development by their very existence.\\r\\nBig growers tend to dominate in Oregon, like Holiday Tree Farms, which uses helicopters to harvest about a million trees annually, for sale at big box stores and other locations.\\r\\nIn western North Carolina, the farms tend to be smaller, like the one owned by Larry Smith, who has been growing trees for more than 40 years.\\r\\nHis business, Mountain Top Fraser Fir, was chosen to supply this year\u2019s White House Christmas tree, a 19-foot specimen on display in the Blue Room.\\r\\n\u201cTell the kids and grandkids to keep buying real trees so we keep the local economy strong and we don\u2019t have to sell the land to the rich people from New York City to make condos,\u201d Mr. Smith said.\\r\\nPrices for real trees have reached record highs over the last few years because farmers planted fewer trees during the 2008 recession. That may have driven some families to make the leap to a manufactured one. The average price was $75 for a real tree last year, while the average price for an artificial tree \u2014 which can be reused \u2014 was $107, according to a Nielsen\/Harris poll conducted on behalf of the National Christmas Tree Association, which represents sellers of real trees.\\r\\nTim O\u2019Connor, a spokesman for the organization, said the best way to ensure future supply was to buy a tree this year.\\r\\nReusing an artificial tree reduces its environmental impact. (True.)\\r\\nA recent survey for the American Christmas Tree Association, conducted by Nielsen, found that three quarters of American households display a tree \u2014 and the vast majority of those, around 80 percent, are artificial.\\r\\nMost of the artificial trees on the market are made of PVC and steel in China and shipped to the United States \u2014 and eventually sent to a landfill.\\r\\nWhile that may not sound eco-friendly, the A.C.T.A., which represents manufacturers, claims the environmental impact is lower than that of a real tree if you use the artificial tree for five or more years. The group argues that getting a new, real tree each year \u2014 and possibly disposing of it in a landfill at the end of the season \u2014 has a bigger impact on greenhouse gas emissions, water and energy use, and other areas than a reused artificial tree does.\\r\\nThat assertion is based on a study carried out on the group\u2019s behalf by WAP Sustainability Consulting.\\r\\nMr. O\u2019Connor of the N.C.T.A., the organization that represents sellers of real trees, said he rejected the study\u2019s findings, saying it was \u201cfall-off-your-horse simple that a tree made out of oil, turned into PVC plastic in China and shipped over on a boat, cannot be better than growing a real tree.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Cregg, the forestry expert at Michigan State, said the study\u2019s parameters were too narrow. What about the effect on wildlife and local water supplies, he asked, and the benefit of preserving farmland and jobs?\\r\\n\u201cAre you interested in supporting the local economy and keeping plastic out of landfills?\u201d he said. \u201cThose would be the questions I would focus on.\u201d\\r\\nThomas Harman, the founder and chief executive of Balsam Hill, a high-end artificial tree company, said that his factories recycle scrap plastic for use in some components of their products. But manufacturing a recyclable tree has been challenging. The copper, steel and plastic that are fused together in the production process would need to be taken apart to be recycled.\\r\\nIn the meantime, he encouraged people to reuse trees and to adorn them with LED lights, which save energy.\\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019re focused on making our trees reusable as long as possible,\u201d Mr. Harman said. \u201cI hope that our trees are in use 20 or 30 years later.\u201d\\r\\nThe greenest real tree is the one that\u2019s bought locally and recycled. (True.)\\r\\nThe preference for real trees is strongest in the Northeast and along the West Coast, data from the A.C.T.A. shows. Mr. O\u2019Connor said that younger, more environmentally conscious consumers \u2014 the same ones who buy organic produce at the grocery store \u2014 are increasingly embracing real trees. And some families enjoy visiting farms to choose and cut their own trees.\\r\\n\u201cThere\u2019s this wonderful family experience that\u2019s just not parallel to dragging a dusty box out of the attic,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Connor said.\\r\\nBill Ulfelder, the executive director of the Nature Conservancy in New York, said real trees were \u201cunquestionably\u201d the better option. He added that there are ways shoppers can lessen the impact of using a real tree: Shop locally, minimize driving and recycle the tree.\\r\\nNew York City collects thousands of trees for MulchFest each year, and uses the mulch in public parks to enrich soil and prevent erosion. Some areas also use discarded trees to prevent beach erosion or sink them into lakes to create fish habitats.\\r\\nYou can also avoid the need to discard an old tree entirely. Some vendors sell living Christmas trees that can be replanted. Others rent traditional Christmas trees, complete with delivery and setup.\\r\\nThe tree is just a drop in the bucket in this season of air travel and consumerism. (True.)\\r\\nBrad McAllister, a managing director of WAP Sustainability Consulting, said he was surprised by how small the impact of either tree choice was compared with other central elements of the holidays, like air travel and shopping.\\r\\n\u201cIf a consumer wants to celebrate the holidays in a truly environmental fashion, they need to look beyond just the Christmas tree,\u201d he said.\\r\\nJami Warner, the executive director of the A.C.T.A., was eager to avoid a direct confrontation on the issue of real versus artificial. \\r\\n\u201cWe really do believe that there is no such thing as a bad Christmas tree,\u201d she said.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1140201220,\"description\":\"Here\u2019s a look at the central claims \u2014 and the common misconceptions \u2014 in that debate.\\r\",\"title\":\"Real vs. Artificial Christmas Trees: Which Is the Greener Choice?\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.38.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"WELLINGTON, New Zealand \u2014 More than 140 pilot whales died after beaching themselves in southern New Zealand, with half being euthanized by conservation workers in a \u201cdeeply saddening\u201d decision after their discovery came too late to rescue them, officials said Monday.\\r\\nThe stranding, in an isolated part of Stewart Island, off the coast of the South Island, was the largest in New Zealand since 250 pilot whales died last year in one of the worst such incidents in the country\u2019s history.\\r\\nThe beached whales on Stewart Island were discovered in two separate groups, or pods, just as several other whale deaths and strandings were reported around the country over the weekend.\\r\\nThe Department of Conservation said Monday that as many as 145 whales beached themselves at Mason Bay, on the island\u2019s west side, where they were discovered by a hiker on Saturday afternoon.\\r\\nRen Leppens, the department\u2019s operations manager for the island, said the hiker walked for \u201ctwo to three hours\u201d to alert conservation staff. Half of the whales were already dead by the time rangers reached the two pods, leaving the rest to be euthanized.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s deeply saddening,\u201d said Mr. Leppens, who added that the whales, which might have been stranded as early as Friday, had \u201cstarted to get covered in sand\u201d by the time they were found. Poor weather meant that experts could not be flown in to assess the situation, so euthanizing them was the only option, he said.\\r\\nMr. Leppens said the beach was the site of three previous mass strandings. More than 300 whales beached themselves near Mason Bay in 1998.\\r\\nThe Department of Conservation said the events are believed to happen when whales make navigational mistakes while chasing prey, escaping predators or trying to protect sick members of the group, but more than one factor could contribute.\\r\\nLast February, 250 whales died after hundreds became beached at Farewell Spit, one of the most common locations for whale strandings in New Zealand. They died after 500 rescuers frantically tried to refloat the animals.\\r\\nKrista Hupman, a marine mammal biologist for the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in New Zealand, said whale conservation groups kept a close eye on Farewell Spit and were ready to convene rescue teams at short notice when the animals appeared to be swimming toward the coastline.\\r\\n\u201cBut without that initial sighting we\u2019re out of luck,\u201d she said, referring to the remoteness of the stranding at Stewart Island, which is home to just 402 people.\\r\\nAt the opposite end of the country, rescuers at Ninety Mile Beach, near the northern tip of the North Island, delayed efforts to refloat eight stranded pygmy killer whales until Tuesday because of bad weather. Four whales had died on the beach as of Monday. Two other whales beached themselves elsewhere in New Zealand, officials said.\\r\\nThe Department of Conservation said the deaths were \u201cunlikely to be related,\u201d and Ms. Hupman, the whale biologist, said strandings were common in New Zealand at this time of year.\\r\\nWhile New Zealand is known to have an unusually high number of whale strandings, she said, scientists did not know why they were so frequent, the reasons behind them, or whether refloating the animals was the best way to respond.\\r\\nMr. Leppens, the Department of Conservation operations manager, said that the remote location meant conservation staff would leave the whales on the beach to decompose and \u201clet nature take its course.\u201d\\r\\nBut the exact circumstances of the stranding remained a mystery.\\r\\n\u201cThe sooner technology can race forward and give us a better idea of why this happens, the better,\u201d he said.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":2109582421,\"description\":\"Such mass beachings can happen when whales make navigational mistakes while chasing prey, escaping predators or trying to protect sick members of the group.\\r\",\"title\":\"More Than 140 Whales Die in New Zealand After Mass Beaching\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.39.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"President Trump frequently promotes the idea that when the United States places a tariff on an import from another country, that other country directly pays the bill. \\r\\nHe\u2019s wrong, but he keeps saying it.\\r\\n\u201cBillions of dollars will soon be pouring into our Treasury from taxes that China is paying for us,\u201d Mr. Trump said during a news conference earlier this month. On Thursday, he wrote something similar on Twitter:\\r\\nThat tweet raises a question. Are the tariffs being charged to China, or to companies? It\u2019s a good starting point for a sort of F.A.Q. on tariffs that could be useful for executives, voters, even presidents. (For explanatory purposes, The New York Times is supplying both the questions and the answers below.)\\r\\nQ. So who gets \u201ccharged\u201d for tariffs? A foreign government? An American company that manufacturers goods overseas, then sells those goods in the United States? \\r\\nA. Neither of them, technically speaking. When the United States puts a tariff on a Chinese import, it does not send a bill to China. If an American company manufactures a good elsewhere and it is subjected to a tariff, the company doesn\u2019t typically get a bill from the government, either.\\r\\nThen who pays?\\r\\nUsually a middleman, to start. Most American companies that bring products in from abroad do not handle the paperwork themselves. They hire what\u2019s known as an importer of record \u2014 someone whose job it is to navigate the intricacies of the United States Customs and Border Protection\u2019s system for inspecting imports and levying any duties on them. (Duties are a tax or fee placed on an import. Tariffs are a form of duty.)\\r\\nWhen an imported good enters a port in the United States, the importer of record initially gets the bill for the tariff.\\r\\nSo tariffs are a tax on middlemen?\\r\\nNot usually. This is where the question of who pays tariffs gets trickier \u2014 because middlemen tend to pass on their costs.\\r\\nA company that contracts with an importer will almost always see the costs of that contract rise after a tariff has been imposed on goods it imports. So now the company is paying, say, 10 or 25 percent more to bring in the exact same product it imported before the tariffs. The company faces a choice: What should it do about those extra costs?\\r\\nSo tariff costs get passed to an American company. What are its options?\\r\\nThe company could pass on the added costs to consumers, in the form of higher prices. That\u2019s the simplest route, particularly in a competitive market where the supply chain is not easily moved. (Washing machines are a good example of this. Their prices rose in the United States earlier this year after Mr. Trump\u2019s administration imposed tariffs on them.) \\r\\nCompanies can also try to minimize tariffs by switching suppliers or changing the products they sell. In the case of China tariffs, that could mean moving a factory from Beijing to Vietnam. In this case, no one pays the tariffs; the company is making an end-run around them. Alternatively, an American company could negotiate concessions from a Chinese supplier, likely by threatening to shift production. In that case, the Chinese supplier\u2019s profits would fall, and it would bear at least some of the cost of the tariffs. Some research suggests American companies have had success essentially passing the bill back to China.\\r\\nSome companies may choose to absorb the extra costs themselves, by accepting lower profits. They choose neither to raise prices nor immediately pay to shift production, based on the idea that the most economically efficient price to charge for the product is not changed by the existence of tariffs. That could be the case with Apple: It can charge such a premium for iPhones that it might decide to accept smaller profit margins on them for a while, if they become subject to tariffs. \\r\\nHow does China end up paying?\\r\\nIt never does, directly. But there are certainly ways that American tariffs hurt China. If companies move production to Vietnam, China would see less economic growth \u2014 though that itself is not a direct benefit for American production, and in the short term would be a headache for companies that have to find new factories.\\r\\nChinese companies forced to cut costs could have their profits pinched and could reduce hiring or close entirely. That could put pressure on them to move to places like Vietnam.\\r\\nAnother way China could lose: Americans may buy fewer Chinese goods as the prices rise. That\u2019s a loss for China, but it\u2019s also a tax on Americans who buy things. \\r\\nThe United States government is not \u201ccharging\u201d China or the American people. But, in many ways, Americans are paying the costs anyway.\\r\\nBut someone is paying tariffs, right? Where does that money go?\\r\\nTo the United States government. Mr. Trump appears correct that his tariff increases are bringing \u201cbillions\u201d of dollars into federal coffers: Revenue from tariffs exceeded $5.5 billion in October, according to the Treasury Department, up from $3.2 billion in October 2017. That\u2019s a 40 percent gain. But even over the course of a year, it isn\u2019t nearly enough to counter the sharp increases in the federal budget deficit that Mr. Trump has overseen.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-451824310,\"description\":\"We don\u2019t send a bill to China, and other basics of what happens when the United States decides to tax an imported good.\\r\",\"title\":\"How Tariffs Work, and Why China Won\u2019t See a Bill\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"business.30.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"The recent killing of an American missionary by members of an isolated tribe on a small island in the Indian Ocean has reignited questions about the fate of the last few groups of people living off the grid.\\r\\nIn an era when people across the globe are hyper-connected by technology and increasingly interlocked economies, the survival of a few dozen groups of hunter-gatherers living in complete isolation may seem extraordinary. But experts say they may not survive undisturbed for much longer.\\r\\nBecause most of these groups are small and highly vulnerable, anthropologists and indigenous activists have been debating whether it makes more sense to leave them alone \u2014 or try to establish contact with them to offer basic medical care, such as vaccines. Here are some basic facts about the world\u2019s remaining isolated tribes.\\r\\nHow many are there, and where?\\r\\nAnthropologists and activists who study the issue say it\u2019s hard to know for certain. But based on satellite images and field research, experts believe there are more than 100 communities living in isolation.\\r\\nThe vast majority of groups live in the Amazon basin in areas that straddle Brazil and Peru. The only relatively large community outside of South America belongs to the Sentinelese, who live on North Sentinel Island. It is nominally part of India, but technically a sovereign territory.\\r\\nThat is where John Allen Chau, the American, was killed on a mission to convert the local residents to Christianity.\\r\\nThe Sentinelese have responded violently to past incursions by outsiders, which has led the Indian government to maintain a \u201cno-contact\u201d policy.\\r\\nWhy do these communities choose to remain isolated?\\r\\nBased on accounts from people who have ceased living in isolation, and those who have had fleeting contact with these societies, experts say members of these communities are fearful that contact with outsiders would bring disease and mistreatment. Native communities in the Amazon were ravaged when European settlers began colonizing the Americas in the 1500s and later in the 1800s when rubber tappers flooded the region.\\r\\n\u201cMany tribes in the frontier region of Brazil and Peru are probably survivors of the rubber boom who witnessed the enslavement and atrocities against indigenous peoples and fled to the headwaters of the Amazon to evade capture,\u201d said Jonathan Mazower, an expert on isolated communities at Survival, a London-based organization that advocates greater protection for the groups.\\r\\n\u201cThe historical memory of this era is likely to have been passed down to the current generation,\u201d he said.\\r\\nAre these communities endangered?\\r\\nLoggers, miners, cattle ranchers and drug traffickers have encroached on the territories of these groups, exposing them to violence and disease.\\r\\nAnthropologists at the University of Missouri who study the size and resilience of these groups, based on satellite images and photos shot from aircraft, classify the ones they track as either \u201cvulnerable\u201d or \u201ccritical.\u201d\\r\\nBrazilian prosecutors last year investigated reports of a massacre of uncontacted tribesmen by gold miners.\\r\\nThe country\u2019s incoming president, Jair Bolsonaro, has said he wants to do away with protected indigenous lands, which are safeguarded by Brazil\u2019s Constitution, arguing that indigenous people should no longer be treated as if they live in zoos.\\r\\nIs there a safe, ethical way to contact and support indigenous people?\\r\\nAnthropologists and activists for isolated tribes have long wrestled with that question.\\r\\nRobert Walker and Kim Hill, two prominent anthropologists who study isolated societies, argued in an essay published in 2015 that it was time to reconsider the no-contact policy that governments like Brazil and Peru have maintained in recent years.\\r\\n\u201cUnless protection efforts against external threats and accidental encounters are drastically increased, the chances that these tribes will survive are slim,\u201d Mr. Walker and Mr. Hill wrote in the essay, published in the magazine Science. \u201cDisease epidemics, compounded by demographic variability and inbreeding effects, makes the disappearance of small, isolated groups very probable in the near future.\u201d\\r\\nSurvival disagrees, and instead calls on governments to redouble efforts to keep outsiders from the territories where these communities live.\\r\\n\u201cThese uncontacted peoples make a judgment that they are better off remaining uncontacted and independent, fending for themselves,\u201d Mr. Mazower said. \u201cWhere their lands are protected and their right to remain uncontacted is upheld, they live healthy lives and are totally self-sufficient.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1762469536,\"description\":\"There are dozens of communities that continue to live completely off the grid, mostly in the Amazon, where drug traffickers, miners and ranchers threaten them.\\r\",\"title\":\"Missionary\u2019s Killing Reignites Debate About Isolated Tribes: Contact, Support or Stay Away?\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"world.20.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Wendy MacNaughton is a graphic journalist based in San Francisco.

Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.\\r\\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump White House, which has defined itself by a willingness to dismiss scientific findings and propose its own facts, on Friday issued a scientific report that directly contradicts its own climate-change policies.\\r\\nThat sets the stage for a remarkable split-screen political reality in coming years. The administration is widely expected to discount or ignore the report\u2019s detailed findings of the economic strain caused by climate change, even as it continues to cut environmental regulations, while opponents use it to mount legal attacks against the very administration that issued the report.\\r\\n\u201cThis report will be used in court in significant ways,\u201d said Richard L. Revesz, an expert in environmental law at New York University. \u201cI can imagine a lawyer for the Trump administration being asked by a federal judge, \u2018How can the federal government acknowledge the seriousness of the problem, and then set aside the rules that protect the American people from the problem?\u2019 And they might squirm around coming up with an answer.\u201d\\r\\nThe 1,656-page National Climate Assessment, which is required by Congress, is the most comprehensive scientific study to date detailing the effects of global warming on the United States economy, public health, coastlines and infrastructure. It describes in precise detail how the warming planet will wreak hundreds of billions of dollars of damage in coming decades.\\r\\nPresident Trump has often questioned or mocked the basic science of human-caused climate change, and is now working aggressively to encourage the burning of coal and the increase of greenhouse gas pollution.\\r\\nHistorians and veterans of public service said it was notable that policymakers didn\u2019t try to soften the report\u2019s conclusions, because that indicated the strength of the administration\u2019s belief that it could ignore the findings in favor of policies driven by political ideology. \u201cThis is a new frontier of disavowance of science, of disdain for facts,\u201d said William K. Reilly, who headed the Environmental Protection Agency under the first President George Bush.\\r\\nA White House statement said the report, started under the Obama administration, was \u201clargely based on the most extreme scenario\u201d of global warming and that the next assessment would provide an opportunity for greater balance.\\r\\nUnder a 1990 law, the federal government is required to issue the climate assessment every four years. The latest version introduces new complexity in the political fight over regulations designed to fight climate change. That\u2019s because, until the administration of President Barack Obama, no such regulations existed to be fought over. \\r\\nMr. Trump has made it a centerpiece of his administration\u2019s policy to undo these rules. He has directed the Environmental Protection Agency to sharply weaken the nation\u2019s two major policies for curbing planet-warming pollution: One rule that would restrict greenhouse emissions from vehicle tailpipes, and another that would limit them from power plant smokestacks.\\r\\nThe rules are grounded in a 2009 legal finding, which has been upheld by federal courts, that planet-warming pollution harms human health and well-being, and therefore government policies are needed to reduce it.\\r\\nIn publishing the assessment, White House officials made a calculation that Mr. Trump\u2019s core base of supporters most likely would not care that its findings are so at odds with the president\u2019s statements and policies. \\r\\nThat view is supported by Steven J. Milloy, a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s E.P.A. transition team who runs the website junkscience.com, which is aimed at casting doubt on the established science of human-caused climate change. \u201cWe don\u2019t care,\u201d he said. \u201cIn our view, this is made-up hysteria anyway.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Milloy echoed a talking point used by other critics of the report, calling it the product of the \u201cdeep state,\u201d a term that refers to the conspiratorial notion of a secret alliance of bureaucrats and others who oppose the president. \\r\\n\u201cTrying to stop the deep state from doing this in the first place, or trying to alter the document, and then creating a whole new narrative \u2014 it\u2019s better to just have it come out and get it over with,\u201d said Mr. Milloy. \u201cBut do it on a day when nobody cares, and hope it gets swept away by the next day\u2019s news.\u201d\\r\\nWork on the climate assessment, which was performed by about 300 scientists, including career government scientists at 13 federal agencies, commenced shortly after the publication of the previous report, in 2014. The project was already well underway by the time Mr. Trump took office in 2017.\\r\\nThe decision not to alter or suppress the report\u2019s findings \u2014 despite its scientific conclusions so much at odds with the president\u2019s policies \u2014 reflected a clear political calculus, according to three people familiar with the White House\u2019s thinking. \\r\\nSince the report is mandated by Congress, not issuing it would have been a violation of the law. While some political appointees within one of the agencies that contributed scientific work to the report did suggest editing the summary of its conclusions to play down the findings, that idea was also seen as too risky politically and legally, these people said.\\r\\nInstead, these people said, administration officials hoped to minimize the impact by making the assessment public on the afternoon of Black Friday, the big shopping day after the Thanksgiving holiday, thinking that Americans might be unlikely to be paying attention. \\r\\nPeople familiar with the decision to publish said that White House officials sought to avoid the political blowback that hit the George W. Bush administration when it was revealed in 2005 that a White House official and former oil lobbyist, Philip A. Cooney, altered the language of government climate science reports  to weaken the link between fossil fuel pollution and the warming of the planet.\\r\\n\u201cThis moment tells you that there is a difference between the White House and the president,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. The White House has \u201clawyers and policy experts that don\u2019t want to go down in history as falsifying data.\u201d \\r\\nIn light of Friday\u2019s report, Mr. Brinkley drew a parallel between Mr. Trump\u2019s statements on climate science and President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s false statements to the American public a half-century ago about the Vietnam War. \u201cJohnson used to tell people everything was going well in Vietnam, and then you\u2019d turn on the news and see the mayhem,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was this giant disconnect.\u201d\\r\\nIn interviews with about a dozen authors of the climate assessment, all said that White House officials had not sought to soften or weaken its language.\\r\\n\u201cI will give credit where it\u2019s due: No one at the political level did any monkeying around with this,\u201d said Andrew Light, a co-author of the report and a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute, a Washington research organization. \u201cFor all the criticism of the Trump administration quashing climate science, this is one case where they did not do that.\u201d\\r\\nNevertheless, despite the satisfaction at seeing their scientific work made public, many of the authors expressed disappointment that Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy appears to be to ignore the findings and move forward with plans to undo climate change policies.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly frustrating,\u201d said Paul Chinowsky, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and a co-author of the report\u2019s chapter on the effect of climate change on roads, bridges and other infrastructure. That chapter concludes that more extreme storms, flooding and heat waves, along with rising sea levels, will damage the nation\u2019s roadways, leading to dangerous infrastructure collapses and up to $21 billion in damage by the century\u2019s end.\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019m watching these arguments between politicians and scientists, but I\u2019m on the ground with public works officials who say that argument\u2019s irrelevant,\u201d Mr. Chinowsky said. \u201cPeople are going to get hurt and die if we don\u2019t change the policy.\u201d\\r\\nFor more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1859524604,\"description\":\"Friday's government report, detailing in stark terms the economic cost of climate change, is likely to be played down by the administration, even as opponents use it to attack Trump policies.\\r\",\"title\":\"News AnALYSIS: Trump Administration\u2019s Strategy on Climate: Try to Bury Its Own Scientific Report\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.41.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"At War is a newsletter about the experiences and costs of war with stories from Times reporters and outside voices.\\r\\nEarlier this month, Zachary Bell, a former Marine rifleman and infantry squad leader, received an unsolicited email from the head of Capstone, a publisher of children\u2019s books in Minnesota.\\r\\nThe New York Times Magazine had just published Bell\u2019s first article for the At War channel, in which he had detailed his reaction this summer to observing his two daughters, ages 8 and 10, reading \u201cWar in Afghanistan: An Interactive Modern History Adventure,\u201d a book in Capstone\u2019s You Choose series. The book included a chapter on an operation in 2010 in Marjah, a Taliban stronghold in Helmand Province, in which Bell participated. He watched and listened as they confronted the text\u2019s notional choices, including how to navigate the perilous landscape and whether to fire upon Afghan men who might be snipers \u2014 at risk of committing a war crime.\\r\\n[Get a weekly roundup of Times coverage of war delivered to your inbox. Sign up here.]\\r\\nBell\u2019s reaction was unsparing, reflecting his uneasy relationship with his own service in the Afghan war and his surprise upon seeing his children, after a visit to the local library\u2019s children\u2019s section, puzzle over the same bloody deployment that had defined a period of his life. It was not that he was opposed to discussions with his children about the war; he is preparing for the day when he will have these discussions firsthand. It was that the book seemed too light, and presented fictional scenarios where real facts would do.\\r\\n\u201cThe choose-your-adventure format,\u201d he wrote, \u201cfelt breezy and cavalier, recklessly presenting a bloody contest between the Taliban and the Marines in a manner largely devoid of consequences. I know what the book did not say. My friends and I killed in Marjah, and Marines in my rifle company lost limbs and lives. No notional exercise in choice will erase the fact that both my battalion and the battalion to our north killed many civilians in the opening days of Operation Moshtarak, when American high-explosive rockets struck occupied Afghan homes. Then, in the end, American plans for the area failed. Today Marjah is again under of the control of the Taliban and warlords.\u201d\\r\\nThis initial surprise \u2014 of having as his daughters encounter his war in their own home \u2014 was only the start. A week after the essay ran, an email from Patricia Stockland, Capstone\u2019s publisher, landed in Bell\u2019s inbox.\\r\\nStockland was direct. \u201cI want to personally apologize for the line we crossed with our War in Afghanistan You Choose book,\u201d she wrote, \u201cand for the disrespect and, as you rightly described it, breeziness of its approach and tone. Your recent piece in The New York Times was humbling, articulate and very much a wake-up call for us.\u201d\\r\\nStockland further informed Bell that Capstone had discontinued the book, planned to destroy the remaining copies in its inventory and was reviewing its entire line of titles to see if it should take action on other books. \u201cWe clearly lost sight of the bigger picture with the publication of this particular work,\u201d she wrote.\\r\\nBell was working in construction near where he lives in Tennessee when the email arrived, and was so taken aback that he had to read it twice to understand what Stockland was saying. Then he found it humbling, a moment of corporate responsibility and mutual respect, both results of his work.\\r\\nStockland later elaborated on her position. \u201cTaking these books out of print is the least we could do, given the confusion and impact the content has had on various readers and their families,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI do wish we could also take them out of circulation, but as we know, words don\u2019t work like that. It is the danger of our work and the responsibility we need to bear more seriously.\u201d She added that Capstone\u2019s review of other titles to date found four more military-themed books in progress for the You Choose series, and that Capstone has ceased production of them.\\r\\nThe outcome of this essay aligned with why Bell wanted to write in the first place. He had hoped to resist cartoonish or airbrushed discussions of military service, and to summon a way of talking about war that, in his words, was not \u201creverential of combat, but having an honest conversation about it.\u201d\\r\\nIn a time of more insider attacks in Afghanistan, open-ended combat operations in multiple countries, partnerships with allies engaged in campaigns that have caused grave civilian harm (as the Saudi Arabian military has in Yemen) and troops on border-security duties timed to midterm elections, we look forward to mentoring and publishing more writers like Bell with firsthand experience of war, who seek a voice in public conversations that too often exclude those who have been there.\\r\\nThe Latest Stories From At War\\r\\nEditor\u2019s Picks\\r\\n3 U.S. Soldiers Died in Afghanistan: Why This Fight Drags On: Why Americans are still dying in a city they liberated from the Taliban months ago: Not enough commandos, too many casualties, and a many-fronted war.\\r\\nU.S. Troops Went to the Border in 1997.

But new scientific developments this year helped make the case that the cold and dusty world may have been more hospitable long ago.\\r\\nIn June, scientists, using data from NASA\u2019s Curiosity rover, for the first time confidently identified organic molecules used and produced by living organisms (although it is possible for such substances to be produced in chemical reactions that are not biological):\\r\\nThen in July, Italian scientists working on the European Space Agency\u2019s Mars Express mission reported the discovery of a large, watery lake beneath the planet\u2019s southern polar ice, suggesting an exciting new place to search for life-forms:\\r\\nMartian weather reports\\r\\nStarting in May, Mars was enveloped by one of the most massive dust storms ever observed on the planet. As the storm blotted out the sun, it also silenced Opportunity, one of the two NASA rovers studying the planet\u2019s surface features. Drained of power, Opportunity has not called home to Earth since, although NASA hopes winds on the planet will remove dust from its solar panels and allow its batteries to charge again. Read more about the dust storm:\\r\\nOther weather on Mars yielded its own intriguing imagery. In a picture released by the European Space Agency, a large cloud formation trailed one of the planet\u2019s large extinct volcanoes. It wasn\u2019t a volcanic eruption, although it could have been mistaken for one:\\r\\nThe next American voyage to the red planet\\r\\nA number of space agencies around the world intend to send robotic explorers to Mars in the next decade. Plans for NASA\u2019s Mars 2020 rover came into clearer focus this year. \\r\\nEarlier this month, NASA announced the destination for the rover, which will be similar to the active Curiosity rover but with improved instruments for scientific study. The Mars 2020 rover will attempt to land at the Jezero Crater, which used to be the site of a large lake and rivers. Scientists say that spot offers a good target for collecting samples that could point toward signs of extinct life:\\r\\nThat rover will also carry something never before sent by humans to another planet \u2014 a small helicopter. The four-pound rotorcraft will take photographs and demonstrate the possibilities of flight in the thin Martian atmosphere during five short takeoffs and landings:\\r\\nAs close to Mars as many of us get\\r\\nIf you were fortunate this summer, you looked up at your night sky and spotted a large red dot. It was Mars.\\r\\nDuring a brief window every two years, Mars and the sun are on opposite sides of Earth, a formation also known as opposition. But once every 15 years or so, that state of opposition lines up with the moments in Mars\u2019s orbit when it comes closest to the sun, or perihelion. \\r\\nThat rouge orb, brighter than usual in our summer skies, was a vivid reminder of the rusty red world sharing our star. From that vantage it fired our imaginations, and it may again on Monday when the InSight lander tries to find a safe spot on one of Mars\u2019s dusty plains:\\r\\n\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":419301421,\"description\":\"Here\u2019s a refresher of what\u2019s happened on the red planet in 2018 as a NASA spacecraft prepares to arrive there on Monday.\\r\",\"title\":\"Mars Had a Busy Year.

The figure they come up with often relies on a popular rule of thumb: the so-called 4 percent rule.\\r\\nThis rule holds that if you invest in a mix of roughly 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds, you can safely spend 4 percent of your savings annually over 30 years without fear of depleting your nest egg.\\r\\nSo if you retired at 65 with $1 million, you could withdraw $40,000 (adjusted each year for inflation) for living expenses until you run out of money at 95. Add this $40,000 to Social Security and any other income you may be collecting, and that\u2019s your annual spending budget in retirement. Need more than that? You\u2019ll either have to cut expenses or save more money before you\u2019re ready to retire.\\r\\nThere\u2019s a lot of research to suggest that following the 4 percent rule \u2014 or something close to 4 percent \u2014 is a good way to make your savings last. This approach is at the heart of many popular online retirement calculators.\\r\\nBut does retirement spending actually work that way? Do retirees really spend a fixed amount each year for the rest of their lives?\\r\\nThey do not, many financial advisers and academics say. \u201cThis is my 35th year in practice, and I can tell you none of my clients has ever spent on a straight line,\u201d said Neal Van Zutphen, a certified financial planner with the firm Intrinsic Wealth Counsel in Tempe, Ariz. \u201cYour spending habits and your spending needs will change over time.\u201d\\r\\nHere\u2019s one reason that\u2019s important: You may be closer to having enough money to retire than you think.\\r\\n\u201cThe frustration for clients is they have to save this big bunch of money to produce this big number,\u201d Mr. Van Zutphen said. \u201cSome of them hate their jobs, and they can\u2019t wait to get out. As a planner, you feel like you\u2019re torturing the client by making them stay longer and work harder. Instead, why don\u2019t we sit down and figure out what\u2019s really happening with them?\u201d\\r\\nAlthough his clients Rod and Jeannie Koleno didn\u2019t hate working in Mr. Koleno\u2019s dental practice in Eugene Ore., they hoped to sell it and retire in 2001, when he turned 59. Mr. Van Zutphen showed them that they had enough money to retire a year earlier if they wanted. Their reaction? \u201cYippee!\u201d Ms. Koleno recalled.\\r\\nMr. Van Zutphen was counting on the Kolenos to spend more in their first years as retirees and less as they got older. Which is what has happened. Expenses that hit them hard in their early retired years \u2014 helping out their six children a bit and caring for their aging parents \u2014 have dropped away. Now they\u2019re living frugally and happily in Ketchum, Idaho.\\r\\nFinancial advisers have a few ways of describing the decline in retirement spending over time. One of the most popular, coined by the certified financial planner Michael K. Stein, is to view retirement as three stages: your Go-Go years, your Slow-Go years and, finally, your No-Go years.\\r\\nData from the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggests the decline is true. The mean spending for households headed by 55- to 64-year-olds was $65,000 in 2017, according to its Consumer Expenditure Survey. Spending dropped to $55,000 between ages 65 and 74, and after that it fell to $42,000. Housing costs remained steady and health care expenses increased, but nearly every other category \u2014 transportation, entertainment, clothing, food and drink \u2014 declined sharply.\\r\\nJ. P. Morgan Asset Management has studied the spending patterns of its customers and witnessed the same trend. Spending drop-offs are even more pronounced among retirees with $1 million to $3 million in assets, said Katherine Roy, the firm\u2019s chief retirement strategist.\\r\\n\u201cIt appears the more you have, the steeper the spending decline in real terms,\u201d she said.\\r\\nMs. Roy figures that traditional financial planning tools \u2014 ones that expect spending to keep pace with inflation for 30 years \u2014 \u201ccould overstate spending in late retirement by 30 percent or more.\u201d\\r\\nOne of her firm\u2019s studies grouped 613,000 JPMorgan Chase customers into profiles based on their spending patterns. These included homebodies, globe-trotters, health care spenders and foodies.\\r\\nIt\u2019s worth figuring out which profile matches your spending, said Wade Pfau, a professor at the American College of Financial Services and director of retirement research at McLean Asset Management. If you fall into one of the first three groups, you may be looking at spending increases throughout your retirement. But people in the biggest group \u2014 the 39 percent who spend more than others on food and drink \u2014 can reasonably expect the \u201cGo-Go, Slow-Go, No-Go\u201d progression.\\r\\n\u201cThis is the group that tends to spend less as they age,\u201d Dr. Pfau said.\\r\\nEven when it declines, retirement spending in today\u2019s dollars doesn\u2019t always follow a straight path. It often resembles a smile, according to a study by David Blanchett, head of retirement research at Morningstar. That is, it starts high, gradually declines, and then increases toward the end of a retiree\u2019s life. He based his study on real-life data from the Health and Retirement Study, a project of the National Institute on Aging and the University of Michigan.\\r\\nThose later-year gains in spending are almost always related to health care, Dr. Blanchett said. Even with those increases, however, retirees in their 70s and 80s still tend to spend less than when they first quit working.\\r\\n\u201cThe real change in annual spending through retirement is clearly negative,\u201d Dr. Blanchett said.\\r\\nThis is something financial advisers should go over with their clients, he added. \u201cThey can say, \u2018The most common assumption is that you\u2019re going to increase your spending by inflation, but here\u2019s the deal: The average person doesn\u2019t do that,\u2019\u201d he said.\\r\\nDr. Blanchett suggests running a separate retirement-spending projection that assumes your spending grows by 1 percentage point less than inflation.\\r\\n\u201cHow does that change how you can spend your money?\u201d he said. \u201cOne thing it can do is free up money when you can most enjoy it. Take that cruise when you\u2019re 65 or 70 because you\u2019re probably not going to be able to take it when you\u2019re 80.\u201d\\r\\nNot every financial adviser thinks it\u2019s a great idea to count on lower spending in your later years. Michaela Herlihy, president of Beacon Financial Planning of Cape Cod in Hyannis, Mass., will happily create alternate spending projections for clients who request them, but her recommendation is to stick with the 4 percent rule.\\r\\n\u201cIf clients are front-loading their spending because they\u2019re waiting to supplement it with Social Security or a pension later, I\u2019d feel better about it,\u201d she said. \u201cOtherwise, I would prefer they didn\u2019t.\u201d\\r\\nOne danger is that spending more in early retirement, combined with a sharp market downturn, could put your portfolio in a deep hole, jeopardizing your later years. Even without a market crash, it can be jarring to watch your investment account shrink.\\r\\n\u201cWhen you say, \u2018I\u2019m going to retire,\u2019 and you turn on the spigot from your savings, the shift in psychology is so big,\u201d Ms. Herlihy said. \u201cThe people who are able to do it more healthily are the ones who see stability in their nest eggs. They go through their retirement years with less worry. The other ones are constantly asking, \u2018Are we going to be O.K.?\u2019\u201d\\r\\nPlanning your retirement around the \u201cGo-Go, Slow-Go, No-Go\u201d spending pattern does require a higher level of risk tolerance, advisers agree. It also takes some discipline. You can\u2019t just go on autopilot. You need to track carefully how much you\u2019re spending and be prepared to adjust if necessary.\\r\\nThis is exactly what Rod and Jeannie Koleno, now 77 and 74, do. They get quarterly updates from their financial adviser, Mr. Van Zutphen, and once a year they carefully plot their expenses for the next 12 months.\\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019re spending less than we used to, but more on things like entertainment and vacations,\u201d Ms. Koleno said. \u201cNot big splashy trips, just fun things with friends and family, things that fit our values.\u201d\\r\\nLooking back, do they have any regrets about spending more freely in their early retirement? Not a chance, Ms. Koleno said. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled with the way things have turned out.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1867068218,\"description\":\"Many people looking to retire assume that they can spend 4 percent of their savings each year and that expenses will stay stable.

Of course, many no-show companies send scouts to assess the competition.\\r\\nWhat used to be obligatory attendance at big-time shows, to attract thousands of media types in one place, is now past.\\r\\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have a proper unveil for a show, we won\u2019t go,\u201d said Mark Dahnke, a spokesman for Audi.\\r\\nHe likes to mention the adoption of a \u201claunch cadence,\u201d and Audi\u2019s conviction that bringing journalists to a one-off event, to spend a day or two with the car, is the more effective road to press attention. To that end, Audi recently invited 1,200 auto writers to San Francisco for the introduction of the E-tron, an electric S.U.V.\\r\\n\u201cIf you do have a big reveal, the media doesn\u2019t have enough time to digest properly what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Mr. Dahnke said, referring to auto-show introductions. Reporters \u201care covering 10 or 15 different brands in a day, and it causes you not to be able to cover a larger topic that might be more complex.\u201d\\r\\nFor some manufacturers, the return isn\u2019t worth the investment. A major presence at a show, with a display and newsconference \u2014 plus lighting, music, catering and the other accouterments \u2014 can cost a half-million dollars or much more.\\r\\nOften the funds are funneled elsewhere. Pointed messages and high-resolution artwork and clips are targeted to consumers though Facebook, YouTube and Instagram.\\r\\nThe digital landscape, over all, has altered how cars are marketed: Last year, BMW introduced its M5 in an Electronic Arts video game. (BMW did take the opportunity in France to unveil its new 3 Series sedan.)\\r\\n\u201cAll the manufacturers are handing out photos, spec sheets, interviews in advance of a lot of these shows,\u201d said Steve Keyes, communications director for Centigrade in Detroit, which handles publicity for Alfa Romeo, Genesis and other brands. \u201cIf I\u2019m a journalist, I\u2019ve got all the information I need before a show \u2014 well, going to one is sort of a moot point.\u201d\\r\\nDespite the declaration of Mr. Diess at VW, one exception to the trend of abandoning the auto show, at least in the United States, is Volkswagen.\\r\\n\u201cBecause of the large attendances, auto shows sell cars,\u201d said Greg Lucia, a marketing spokesman for Volkswagen. \u201cWe look at auto shows as a fundamental way to get our product in front of consumers who are in the purchase funnel.\u201d\\r\\nMark Gillies, a spokesman for VW of America added: \u201cFor us as a small brand in the U.S., shows bring in large numbers of media. We can get the kind of exposure that\u2019s difficult for a 2 percent player, the way a General Motors or Toyota can do outside of an auto show venue.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Diess\u2019s damning opinion grates on many other decision makers in the automotive industry, who say the major shows \u2014 which usually open in the fall in Paris or Frankfurt and extend into the spring in Geneva and New York \u2014 are the defining ingredient to entice customers into showrooms.\\r\\n\u201cAbout 68 percent of those who come to our show are in the market for making a car decision,\u201d said Mark Schienberg, who was visiting Paris in October. \u201cThat\u2019s where the investment really takes off.\u201d Mr. Schienberg is president of the Greater New York Automobile Dealers Association, which organizes the New York International Auto Show each spring.\\r\\n\u201cThe issue for manufacturers is that they only have 20 minutes to do a press conference,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want more time. We get it. But we stress to them, do something at the show, because you can\u2019t fit 6,800 journalists in whatever outside venue they\u2019re doing.\u201d\\r\\nWhile reports of the auto show\u2019s death may be exaggerated, the portents are ominous.\\r\\nIn Paris, acres of show floor were occupied by motorcycles and lots of Suzuki cars and trucks, a budget line that has largely abandoned the United States market. (It still sells motorcycles here.) And some of the companies that did go to Paris tried to leverage the situation by negotiating for a lower stand rental. That didn\u2019t work, said Jean-Claude Girot, the event\u2019s chief.\\r\\n\u201cI am not receptive to that,\u201d Mr. Girot said. \u201cWe are a commercial operation, and we must have profits.\u201d\\r\\nHe did allow that changing the generic formula is a must. \u201cWe have to reinvent \u2014 be more inventive, but no less interesting,\u201d he said. \u201cSmaller booths, perhaps. We have to fight to be better, to show better things to the visitors and press, and to keep the passion.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1847803831,\"description\":\"What used to be obligatory attendance at big-time shows, to attract thousands of media types in one place at one time, is now past.\\r\",\"title\":\"Wheels: For Carmakers, Auto Shows Are No Longer Can\u2019t-Miss Events\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"business.36.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a title for what I do\u201d is how Aminatou Sow, 33, describes her career, which takes many forms. Certainly, she is best known for hosting \u201cCall Your Girlfriend,\u201d a podcast devoted to sprawling conversations with her friend and collaborator Ann Friedman. Its popularity, with 6.1 million downloads in 2017, led to a live tour that sold out shows in New York, Washington, San Francisco and Boston this fall, and the pair are writing a book, \u201cBig Friendship,\u201d for release in 2020.\\r\\nBut Ms. Sow, who lives in Brooklyn and speaks five languages, also works as a digital consultant and strategist for brands such as Smartwater and State Farm. Previously, she was at Google, running marketing for the company\u2019s civic initiatives. She also moderates panels and does live interviews with public figures, including Hillary Clinton and the gymnast Aly Raisman, and she co-founded Tech LadyMafia, a network that links women working in the digital economy.\\r\\nWhen Ms. Sow is pressed to come up with one single job title that encompasses all she does, she looks back at the last year, figures out what category of work made her the most money, and says she is that. Last year, that made her a digital strategist. This year, her work for brands is dovetailing with the increasingly public role she has developed via \u201cCall Your Girlfriend,\u201d which means she\u2019s becoming that thing everyone under the age of 40 would probably like to be: an influencer. (She appears in the documentary \u201cRBG,\u201d about the Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, after helping to popularize the meme \u201cCan\u2019t Spell Truth Without Ruth.\u201d) We connected earlier this fall, just before her podcast tour began.\\r\\nSaturday\\r\\n6 a.m. I\u2019m usually militant about taking Saturday off \u2014 it\u2019s the only true weekend day as far as I am concerned. But all summer, I\u2019d been trying to refine a sort of workshop-slash-talk about women\u2019s ambition, and today I finally got a chance to do it at the Wing, the rad women\u2019s co-working space I belong to. At the core, I\u2019m creating space for women to ask questions about ambition, money and power. Female success is complicated. We celebrate lots of individual women for their success, but it\u2019s a whole different beast if you\u2019re seen to be actively seeking power, money or influence.\\r\\nI\u2019ve been ambitious my whole life. It\u2019s not a dirty word. I want to be rich! I want all the women I know to be rich.\\r\\n11 a.m. The workshop is sponsored by Smartwater and there\u2019s a photo and video shoot going on throughout.\\r\\n5:30 p.m. As soon as I get home, I lay on the floor of my apartment to decompress. I roll a joint and listen to this African music+country music mixtape for a few hours. My happiest place.\\r\\nSunday\\r\\n10 a.m. Since I robbed myself of Saturday, I did zero work on Sunday.\\r\\nMonday\\r\\n5 a.m. Wake up but stay in bed until 6, before making a scramble and brewing some tea. I don\u2019t drink coffee. I like to wake up to Afrobeats, so that usually comes on the Sonos, but sometimes it\u2019s very ignorant rap. The first thing I do every morning is look at my Gcal to get a sense of what the day looks like.\\r\\n7 a.m. I\u2019m on autopilot in the mornings and I usually settle into my den slash home office. I leave my computer and phone plugged in here before I go to sleep. My insomnia used to stress me out a lot, but I\u2019m more zen about sleep hygiene these days. No devices in the bedroom.\\r\\n9:30 a.m. I hate invoicing so much but I use Bonsai and it\u2019s pretty chill. Great for tracking time, projects, expenses and, most importantly, sending reminders to the deadbeat media companies that owe me money.\\r\\n10:30 a.m. I call my accountant. I need to find a new one because mine is retiring, which is too bad because I love her. She\u2019s an immigrant like me and gives me so much tough love. She is truly appalled at how I handle money, but she also goes out of her way to make sure I don\u2019t end up in I.R.S. jail. And she\u2019s always reminding me that even though the president is a dirtbag, this is a great time to do business through a pass-through entity.\\r\\n11 a.m. Emails! I just switched over to new Gmail on desktop and it\u2019s terrible. I have to confess, I\u2019ve been using the canned responses and the autocomplete feature and I feel like a serial killer. The canned responses are so cheerful (\u201cGreat, thanks!\u201d) and phony (\u201cThanks, I\u2019ll check it out!\u201d), but ruthlessly efficient.\\r\\n3 p.m. I sit down to do work related to \u201cCall Your Girlfriend,\u201d the podcast I co-host with my friend Ann Friedman. Every week we call each other to discuss everything from politics to pop culture through a feminist lens. It\u2019s a lot of fun but we are also definitely running a small, profitable media company. We\u2019re going on tour this fall and, even though we have a touring agent for the first time, we\u2019re still writing the live show and I\u2019m chasing down sponsors.\\r\\nPeople are afraid of working with their friends, but I love it. It keeps me more honest and motivated.\\r\\n6 p.m. I walk away from the computer and make dinner. My brain is pretty fried, so I stay in and read. (\u201cPetit Piment,\u201d by Alain Mabanckou.)\\r\\nTuesday\\r\\n9 a.m. Today is stacked with doctor appointments: oncology follow-ups and therapy and soooooo much anxiety. Late last year, I had endometrial cancer diagnosed, and even though I am technically in remission, I have a zillion appointments to stay on top of. It feels like a full-time job.\\r\\n10 a.m. I head over to the psychiatrist to discuss my meds. I\u2019ve dealt with depression\/anxiety most of my adult life but medical menopause has made that a bit tougher to navigate. I used to be weirdly Christian Scientist about taking medicine \u2014 not even Advil for headaches \u2014 but now I have seen the light. Shout out to SSRIs and benzodiazepines. I know very few people who don\u2019t struggle with mental health issues, so I am unapologetically open about my own. There is no shame. I\u2019m a productive member of society with a couple of broken neurotransmitters. Not to be all Ina Garten about it, but if you can\u2019t make your own neurotransmitters, store-bought are fine.\\r\\n1 p.m. I do some work at a bar in SoHo and it takes my mind off cancer. I\u2019m in conversation with Rebecca Traister at the New York Public Library tonight, and for the first time in a long time, I\u2019m nervous about moderating an event. She\u2019s a good friend but I\u2019ve also been reading her for over a decade, and she\u2019s shaped so much of my thinking about feminism, power and politics. It feels like an important moment to be discussing women\u2019s anger and I feel some pressure to cover as much ground as possible.\\r\\n5 p.m. I mosey on over to the library and Rebecca is fantastic, as is the response from the crowd.\\r\\n10 p.m. I get home pretty late and take some CBD to sleep. I don\u2019t know if it works, but the trazodone I also take definitely works.\\r\\nWednesday\\r\\n7:30 a.m. First thing this morning is an interview for the podcast with Stacey Abrams, who is running for governor of Georgia. I do some prep but it feels like cheating, because I interviewed her live recently at the Wing.\\r\\n9 a.m. The rest of the morning I spend in my inbox until my computer dies. That\u2019s my method usually: Plug in at night, work until it dies, take a break while it recharges and then get back to work. Same thing with the phone. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s good for the battery, it\u2019s great for my brain.\\r\\n3:30 p.m. Rest of the day is spent slaying the inbox.\\r\\nThursday\\r\\n7 a.m. I\u2019m writing a memoir with Ann. We usually write together in the same room, side by side, but lately we\u2019ve been experimenting with writing separately at our own pace. We give each other the same writing assignment and come back to edit it into a coherent, melded passage. Writing is hard, but the accountability of knowing someone else is doing the exact same thing as you at the exact same time 100 percent works.\\r\\n3:30 p.m. I meet a friend on the Upper East Side and go for a long walk. Getting out of the house is a must if you work from home.\\r\\n8:30 p.m. I go to a dinner put on by a fashion brand in a fancy hotel. I\u2019m seated next to good friends, so it doesn\u2019t feel like work.\\r\\nFriday\\r\\n9 a.m. I am writing an essay for an anthology. I\u2019ve been outlining it for a while on my phone when I have short breaks or when I\u2019m on the train, so I put all of that in a doc and start writing around it. It\u2019s a trashdraft: doesn\u2019t need to be perfect, just needs to be all the word vomit you have in you.\\r\\n1 p.m. Lunch break. There are really no average, normal workweeks for me, so things like eating breakfast at the same time or making lunch at home every day make me feel grounded.\\r\\n2 p.m. Make my to-do list for next week and go back to reading from research pile. It feels like such an indulgence. It\u2019s days like today I am the happiest not to work in an office and lucky enough to pursue all my curiosities.\\r\\n4 p.m. I made too many evening plans this week so I\u2019m making dinner at home tonight and turning my brain off. This week, I billed for $39,500. Of that, $35,000 was for the photo shoot\/brand work on Saturday. Everyone should be an influencer.\\r\\nInterviews are conducted by email, text and phone, then condensed and edited.\\r\\n\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":508388330,\"description\":\"The podcaster and digital strategist\u2019s days are consumed by inbox-slaying, \u201ctrashdrafts\u201d and oncology follow-ups.\\r\",\"title\":\"Like a Boss: Aminatou Sow\u2019s Work Diary: \u2018It\u2019s Not a Dirty Word.

But the financially struggling administration of President Mauricio Macri is not eager to pay for it despite pressure from families who want to recover the bodies of their loved ones.\\r\\nFor now, the only official in a position to order the vessel to be lifted quickly does not seem in a hurry to do so.\\r\\nMarta Y\u00e1\u00f1ez, the federal judge who is in charge of the investigation into the sinking of the submarine, the San Juan, is working with experts to review 67,000 photographs and videos of the submarine and its surroundings to determine what exactly happened to the vessel.\\r\\nBut it is unclear how long the review could take, she said.\\r\\nThose images are to be provided by the end of the month by Ocean Infinity, the Houston-based company that found the San Juan a week ago. If they don\u2019t provide a clear explanation and if it appears her investigation would be helped by studying the sub itself, Judge Y\u00e1\u00f1ez could order a feasibility study to find if the San Juan could be lifted from the seabed.\\r\\nThe judge has made clear she would order it pulled up only if it helped the investigation, not for any other reason.\\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019re all going to have to be patient,\u201d said Judge Y\u00e1\u00f1ez in a phone interview from her courthouse in Caleta Olivia in the southern province of Santa Cruz.\\r\\nAmong the relatives of the submarine\u2019s crew members, who have been waiting more than a year for news of their loved ones, patience is in short supply.\\r\\n\u201cThe judge is very slow,\u201d complained Natalia Tocon\u00e1s, 33, whose brother, Mario Armando Tocon\u00e1s, was aboard the San Juan. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be up to us to pressure her to act.\u201d\\r\\nThe demand for the vessel\u2019s salvage is a new chapter in the families\u2019 long battle with officials for answers.\\r\\nMany family members believe the Argentine government would have never hired Ocean Infinity, promising a $7.5 million payout if the submarine was found, if it had not been for the pressure they exerted, including camping outside the presidential palace in Buenos Aires for almost two months.\\r\\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t fight, no one does anything for you,\u201d explained Alejandra Aguilera, 43, who is also a sister of Mr. Tocon\u00e1s. \u201cNow we are going after the judge.\u201d\\r\\nSome family members have filmed a video calling on Judge Y\u00e1\u00f1ez to order the lifting of the San Juan, which they plan to release once she receives the images from Ocean Infinity.\\r\\nMirta Laz, 70, the mother of another crew member, Alberto S\u00e1nchez, was one of approximately two dozen family members who gathered this past week outside the naval base in Mar del Plata, a coastal city that was the base of the San Juan, to demand that the submarine be lifted.\\r\\n\u201cThis is just getting started,\u201d she said. \u201cWe finally know where it is. We need to go get it.\u201d\\r\\nNot all family members agree.\\r\\nLuis Tagliapietra, who is the father of Alejandro Tagliapietra, was aboard the Ocean Infinity-operated search vessel as one of four auditors representing family members when the San Juan was found.\\r\\nRunning such a huge operation to pull up the submarine made no sense to him, he said.\\r\\n\u201cHe was a sailor, he loved the sea,\u201d Mr. Tagliapietra said of his son.\\r\\nDefense Minister Oscar Aguad is also moving to tamp down expectations of a salvage operation, telling the Clar\u00edn newspaper that because of the depth of almost 3,000 feet and \u201cwhere it is located, it is a technologically impossible mission.\u201d\\r\\nExperts, however, disagree.\\r\\nA salvage operation would not be simple or cheap, but there\u2019s no reason to believe it couldn\u2019t be done. Whether it is worthwhile though is another matter, they said.\\r\\n\u201cThere are many operations that were perceived to be close to impossible\u201d before they were carried out successfully, said Richard Janssen, managing director of SMIT Salvage, a subsidiary of the Dutch company Boskalis.\\r\\nSMIT was one of the two companies responsible for raising the Kursk, a Russian nuclear-powered submarine that sank in the Barents Sea in August 2000 with 118 crew members aboard.\\r\\nThat submarine was 380 feet below the surface of the water, compared with almost 3,000 feet for the San Juan, but it was also eight times larger.\\r\\nWhile the Kursk\u2019s raising is often mentioned as an example of what a San Juan salvage operation might resemble, efforts to salvage wrecks from deeper depths give a better sense of the chances of the Argentine submarine\u2019s recovery.\\r\\nSMIT, for example, recovered the Japanese vessel Ehime Maru in one piece from a depth of around 2,000 feet off the Hawaiian coast in 2001.\\r\\nConsidering how much technology has improved since then, going an additional 1,000 feet down to reach the San Juan should not be seen as prohibitive, as that depth is nothing out of the ordinary in oil and gas exploration, Mr. Janssen said.\\r\\nAlso, the San Juan would hardly be the deepest salvage ever undertaken. The C.I.A. \u2014 with the help of the billionaire Howard Hughes \u2014 carried out a Cold War-era operation to recover parts from a Soviet submarine that in 1968 sunk three miles deep in the Pacific.\\r\\nStewart Little, who runs the Submarine Rescue Consultancy and worked with submarines for more than 30 years in the British Royal Navy, said technical issues were not the problem.\\r\\n\u201cIs it feasible?\u201d Mr. Little said. \u201cYes. Is it too deep? No. It\u2019s just the financing that would be an issue.\u201d\\r\\nAlthough the operation\u2019s potential cost is difficult to assess without detailed information about the seabed and the state of the submarine, Mr. Little estimated that any salvage effort would have to start with a budget of about $100 million.\\r\\nThe real question that must be answered before an operation is begun, experts said, is why.\\r\\n\u201cConsidering the San Juan imploded, there may not be much in the way of remains inside and even if there are, it likely won\u2019t be all of them,\u201d said Neil Hopkins, who worked at the British Defense Ministry for 30 years as a civil engineer specializing in submarine design and construction. He now runs Sonistics, a company that specializes in submarine rescues.\\r\\nIf the submarine is raised, he said, \u201cDo you say to 44 families, we can identify 14 of them but not the other 30?\u201d\\r\\nOne reason to spend money salvaging the vessel would be to get information to prevent future accidents, but considering the age of the San Juan, within five years that information would not be relevant to any other submarine in operation, and the whole effort would be \u201can academic exercise with no practical value,\u201d Mr. Little said.\\r\\nAs an alternative to salvaging, the Argentine Navy could designate the submarine a grave and come up with a plan to take the families to the site once a year so they could pay their respects, Mr. Hopkins suggested.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-564932019,\"description\":\"Families of some of the 44 crew members who sank with the San Juan want it salvaged, but experts question the operation.\\r\",\"title\":\"Costly Raising of Argentine Submarine May Not Yield Answers or Bodies, Experts Say\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.43.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times.\\r\\n\u201cWhere were you tortured, and when?\u201d\\r\\nIt was an unremarkable question at a trial whose raw material was cruelty and suffering, during four years of brutal rule in Cambodia by Khmer Rouge fanatics.\\r\\nWas the witness whipped, beaten, waterboarded, suffocated in a plastic bag? Did his torturer poke a stick into his wounds, were his toenails pulled out, were electric wires attached to his ears?\\r\\nDid the prison commandant Kaing Guek Eav, known as Duch, personally beat him until he was out of breath, or did Duch stand back and laugh as he watched, as some witnesses testified?\\r\\nDuch (pronounced DOIK) was the first defendant in the United Nations-backed Khmer Rouge trial I covered for more than a decade, until what may have been the final verdicts, just this month, which convicted two senior leaders of genocide.\\r\\nThose leaders were the last survivors of a group of revolutionaries responsible for the deaths of at least 1.7 million Cambodians from 1975 to 1979, from execution, starvation, overwork or disease.\\r\\nThey left it to others, like Duch, to do the killing.\\r\\nHe was the commandant of the main Khmer Rouge prison, Tuol Sleng, or S-21, where at least 14,000 people were tortured for days or weeks before being sent \u2014 almost every one of them \u2014 to a killing field for execution. \\r\\nIt was a dangerous place to work. As many as one-third of the prison staff was executed, sometimes for torturing with too much enthusiasm and letting a prisoner die.\\r\\nDuch, with his tiny eyes and prominent ears, came to symbolize for me the cold, impersonal cruelty of a movement that lived by the slogan, \u201cTo keep you is no gain, to destroy you is no loss.\u201d\\r\\nI had arrived in Cambodia in 1996, when the country was still ragged and panting from the ravages of four years of mass killing, followed by more than a decade of civil war as the Khmer Rouge returned to their jungle insurgency.\\r\\nI had seen trauma before, but never an entire traumatized nation. I reminded myself regularly that all the adults I met were survivors or former killers, who now had to try to live with what they had seen or done. Almost everyone, survivor or killer, had lost family members. They carried around inside themselves millions of tiny worlds of suffering.\\r\\nI visited land mine victims from the civil war in the military hospital, a dark and dreadful place without regular water or electricity, where men begged me for crutches.\\r\\nOthers, crippled and rejected by society, hopped around the central market seeking alms. Of all of them, it was one man whose stark words stay with me. Holding out his hat to me, he said simply, naming the region where he had lost his leg, \u201cBattambang \u2014 boom!\u201d\\r\\nAt a government hospital I interviewed a psychiatrist \u2014 one of the few who survived the Khmer Rouge years \u2014 who was treating traumatized survivors. But he seemed unable to focus. His words wandered away to his own losses: a child, a spouse, a parent. He looked up. No, he insisted, he was not suffering from trauma. He was fine.\\r\\nA 52-year-old wholesale rice dealer told me she had constant intestinal problems and passed out whenever she went to the bathroom. She said she suffered convulsions and was afraid to go out alone.\\r\\nShe closed her eyes for a moment. \u201cI see a man running, and I see a man shooting,\u201d she said. \u201cI hear gunfire. I can hear the people saying, \u2018Oh, they killed him!\u2019 It is like a snapshot in my mind.\u201d\\r\\nMany with similarly haunting memories told me they were troubled by a single question: Who did this to us, and why?\\r\\nThe trial attempted to answer this question and compiled an unassailable record of historical data. But in the process it raised a deeper human question: What drove these killers and torturers? Are men like Duch somehow different from the rest of us, or do we all carry within us seeds that in the right conditions could turn us into beasts?\\r\\n\u201cHow do human beings become part of a project of mass murder,\u201d asked Alexander Laban Hinton in \u201cMan or Monster?,\u201d his book about Duch. \u201cIt\u2019s too easy to dismiss people as sociopaths or psychos. Instead you really have to grapple with their humanity.\u201d\\r\\nDuch told the court that he had taken his revolutionary name from a children\u2019s story about an obedient schoolboy who tried hard to please his teachers. He said he had attempted to get out of his assignment to work at Tuol Sleng but, like that obedient schoolboy, when he took on the task he was determined to do it right.\\r\\nHe stated proudly that he had invented or refined some of the methods of torture he described.

It shows the rape of the queen of Sparta by Jupiter, the Romans\u2019 Zeus, in the form of a swan.\\r\\nThe archaeological treasure, unearthed this month in the bedroom of a house being excavated on the Via del Vesuvio in Pompeii, was the latest find from an extensive excavation campaign to secure some of the fragile archaeological site\u2019s most at-risk areas.\\r\\n\u201cThis is one of the most critical areas of Pompeii,\u201d Massimo Osanna, the site\u2019s director general, said in a video, which shows an archaeologist carefully brushing centuries of earth from the Leda fresco, which was buried \u2014 along with the rest of the city \u2014 under ash, lapilli and rubble when Vesuvius erupted in 79 A.D.\\r\\nThe recovery of the house is part of a large-scale intervention, known as the Great Pompeii Project, in the Regio V sector of the city, begun in July 2017 with funds from the European Union.\\r\\nThe project involves excavating and securing more than two miles of earth that border an unexcavated area of the ancient city. The archaeological remains along this front have suffered in recent years as a result of collapses and landslides caused by heavy rains.\\r\\nThe remodeling will gradually decrease the slope of the hill, and is expected to drastically reduce the pressure created by the earth on the excavated structures.\\r\\nMr. Osanna said in a phone interview that the Leda fresco was merely the latest of the excavation campaign\u2019s many finds.\\r\\n\u201cThere have been extraordinary discoveries,\u201d he said.\\r\\nIn August, archaeologists also unearthed in an adjacent room of the same house a fresco of the fertility god Priapus weighing a phallus.\\r\\nErotic works of classical mythology were popular in first-century Pompeii, Mr. Osanna said, including the Greek myth of Leda, the Spartan queen and wife of Tyndareus. She was seduced and raped by Zeus in swan form, before having intercourse with her husband.\\r\\nThere are variations to the myth; one holds that Helen, blamed for the Trojan War, and the twins Castor and Pollux were hatched from two eggs from these unions.\\r\\nMr. Osanna said that the presence of the Leda and Priapus frescoes in the house suggested that the owner, likely to have been a freed slave who had made good, was showing off his family\u2019s power.\\r\\n\u201cThese are iconographies that this specific social and political class liked,\u201d he said.\\r\\nAntonio Varone, a former director of the excavations at Pompeii, and the author of a book about Pompeian erotic art, said that sex was seen as \u201ca natural impulse\u201d in ancient times, and that in many cases, homeowners \u201csought to entertain guests\u201d while showing off their erudition.\\r\\n\u201cThese scenes would not have been scandalous; we find even cruder scenes\u201d at some sites, he said.\\r\\nThis year, the excavations on Via del Vesuvio included two houses \u201cwith extraordinary mosaics and frescoes,\u201d Mr. Osanna said.\\r\\nSkeletons were found in one dwelling, as well as a charcoal inscription etched on a wall; Pompeii officials said it supported the theory that Vesuvius erupted in October and not in August, as tradition holds.\\r\\nThe inscription (posted by Mr. Osanna on Instagram) was found in a room that had been undergoing renovations, and gives a date corresponding to Oct. 17. Pompeii officials suggested in a news release that the inscription dates \u201cto a week prior to the great catastrophe.\u201d\\r\\nThis year, archaeologists also found the skeleton of a man who was initially thought to have been crushed by a rock as he tried to escape, though later findings cast doubt on that theory.\\r\\nExcavations will continue into the spring, while the remainder of 2019 will be dedicated to securing the areas that have been unearthed to make them accessible to the public, Mr. Osanna said.\\r\\nAt least 54 acres of the ancient city remain underground.\\r\\n\u201cWe could dig for years, decades, even centuries, but we prefer to leave that to future generations,\u201d he said.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-482678210,\"description\":\"An expensive excavation

will begin its close study of the primitive space rock, seeking clues to the early solar system.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>Launched two years ago, NASA\u2019s Osiris-Rex spacecraft arrives at the asteroid Bennu on Monday. Its mission is to survey the asteroid ahead of retrieving pristine bits of the solar system from the rock\u2019s surface and then bringing them back to Earth in the years ahead.\\r\\n<h2>When does Osiris-Rex arrive at Bennu, and how can I watch it?\\r\\n<br>About noon on Monday, Eastern Time. NASA Television will broadcast coverage of the arrival from 11:45 a.m. to 12:15 p.m.\\r\\n<h2>What does NASA mean by \u201carrive?\u201d Are we there yet?\\r\\n<br>Osiris-Rex\u2019s arrival at Bennu is not like the landing of NASA\u2019s InSight spacecraft in one piece on the surface of Mars last Monday. (Happily, it landed flawlessly.)\\r\\n<br>By contrast, Osiris-Rex is pulling in at a modest speed, and the moment of arrival is a somewhat arbitrary designation. The spacecraft started the approach phase of its mission in August when it was 1.2 million miles from Bennu. On Monday, it will be 12 miles away, although still too far away to orbit the asteroid.\\r\\n<p>There should be no drama. It should be just a smooth transition to the next phase of the mission.\\r\\n<h2>What happens next?\\r\\n<br>Osiris-Rex will make a series of passes over the asteroid at a range of 4.3 miles for an initial survey to better determine its mass, rate of spin and shape.\\r\\n<br>In January, the spacecraft will get closer to Bennu, between 0.9 and 1.2 miles, and be drawn into orbit around the asteroid. It will then spend more than a year performing reconnaissance of Bennu before attempting to bounce off the surface and collect a sample of the asteroid in mid-2020.\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<h2>What can you tell me about Bennu?\\r\\n<br>Bennu, discovered in 1999, is a carbon-rich, almost black asteroid, about 1,600 feet wide. (That compares to the Empire State Building, which is 1,454 feet tall including the antenna at the top.) Scientists believe that it is a conglomeration of leftovers from the formation of the solar system, largely unchanged over the last 4.5 billion years.\\r\\n<br>Bennu is categorized as a near-Earth asteroid, and scientists say there is a small chance it could slam into Earth, but not until the 22nd century if it happens at all. (It is not large enough to cause planet-wide extinctions, but it would be catastrophic at the point of impact.)\\r\\n<p>[Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.]\\r\\n<h2>What are scientists hoping to learn from Bennu?\\r\\n<br>By studying a primitive asteroid, scientists hope to get a better idea of what was around in the solar system\u2019s earliest days.\\r\\n<br>Dante Lauretta, the principal investigator of Osiris-Rex, said he was particularly interested in gleaning information about organic molecules like amino acids, the building blocks of proteins found on Earth that are also known to exist in interstellar space. One question is whether Bennu contains higher concentrations of the 20 amino acids used by forms of life on Earth. That would suggest the universe favors these amino acids and not dozens of others, even in nonbiological chemical reactions.\\r\\n<br>Life on Earth also exclusively uses so-called \u201cleft-handed\u201d amino acids and not the mirror, right-handed versions. Study of the Bennu material could help explain whether nonbiological chemical reactions in space pushed life toward left-handed molecules or whether that shift occurred later when life arose.\\r\\n<h2>How will Osiris-Rex grab a piece of Bennu?\\r\\n<br>In July 2020, the spacecraft, about the size of a sport utility vehicle, is scheduled to slowly descend and bounce off the surface like a pogo stick at a gentle pace of a quarter-mile per hour. A sampling head, which looks like an automobile air filter, will shoot a burst of nitrogen to kick up dirt and small rocks during the three to five seconds it is in contact with the surface.\\r\\n<br>The goal is to collect at least a couple of ounces of material and possibly as much as 4.4 pounds. The spacecraft carries enough nitrogen to attempt to extract material three times if necessary.\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<h2>Why does it take so long to collect a sample and return to Earth?\\r\\n<br>A quicker mission would have required a larger spacecraft carrying more fuel \u2014 more expensive than the $800 million cost of Osiris-Rex. Instead, the spacecraft took a more efficient but longer trajectory, taking advantage of a flyby of Earth last year to fling it on a path to intersect Bennu. Scientists also want to study Bennu is as much detail as they can before heading back to Earth.\\r\\n<p>After departing Bennu in 2021, Osiris-Rex will pass by Earth in September 2023, dropping off a capsule with the samples that will land via parachute in a Utah desert.\\r\\n<h2>Haven\u2019t other spacecraft explored asteroids already? What\u2019s so special about Osiris-Rex?\\r\\n<br>Quite a few spacecraft have made flybys of asteroids, beginning with NASA\u2019s Galileo spacecraft, which passed within 1,000 miles of the asteroid Gaspra in 1991 en route to Jupiter. NASA\u2019s NEAR Shoemaker (NEAR is short for Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous) went into orbit around the near-Earth asteroid Eros in 2000. Even though it was not designed to land on the asteroid, NEAR Shoemaker did just that in 2001 and continued operating for two weeks from the surface of Eros.\\r\\n<br>The Japanese spacecraft Hayabusa collected some dust samples from an asteroid and returned them in Earth in 2005. A follow-up mission, Hayabusa2 is, like Osiris-Rex, headed to a carbon-rich asteroid and is scheduled to bring its samples back to Earth in 2020.\\r\\n<p>However, not all asteroids are alike, and Osiris-Rex is expected to bring much more rock and dirt back than the Japanese missions. Comparing data from different asteroids will create a fuller picture of what the early solar system was like.\\r\\n<h2>Is this the most contorted name of a NASA mission ever?\\r\\n<br>Perhaps.\\r\\n<br>Dr. Lauretta said that as he jotted some themes of the scientific objectives \u2014 origins, spectroscopy, resources and security \u2014 he had most of the letters of Osiris, the Egyptian god who was the lord of the underworld but who also represented the seeds of regeneration to new life.\\r\\n<br>\u201cIt was the dual nature of the Osiris myth,\u201d Dr. Lauretta said a couple of years ago before launch. \u201cI had to buy a couple of vowels.\u201d\\r\\n<p>With some finagling, he came up with Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security, Regolith Explorer. \\r\\n<p>\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"science.0.txt\",\"id\":1722736910},{\"title\":\"Critical Shopper: The Amazon Warehouse Comes to SoHo\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"Our shopper visits the new Amazon 4 Star store, which stocks items with customer review ratings of four stars or better. Brick and mortar never had it so rough.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>I have a faint memory of an article I read some years back detailing the grim life of a shelf picker in an Amazon warehouse. It described the arrangement of products on shelves \u2014 unlikely juxtapositions determined wholly by algorithm. \\r\\n<br>A worker\u2019s life was disorienting; you never knew where anything might be. Nail clippers might be next to stone humidifiers or HVAC filters or picture frames. The worker was given a product location and ran to it. Then another. And again. The warehouse was a game, the products little more than flippers in search of a pinball to thwack.\\r\\n<br>This holiday season, you are the pinball.\\r\\n<br>Amazon has recently opened Amazon 4-Star, a catchall gift shop in SoHo \u2014 about 100 feet from Balthazar and the MoMA Design Store \u2014 that\u2019s part of the company\u2019s slow seep into physical retail. It is grim. A permanent store with the harried, colorless mood of a hastily assembled clearance-sale pop-up. Lot-Less Closeouts stores have more vim and charm.\\r\\n<p>Amazon 4-Star asks what would happen if the logic of the warehouse writ raw was applied to a traditional storefront. Who needs a warehouse picker when the customers can do the work themselves?\\r\\n<p>Spending time browsing here was among my most dismal shopping experiences in recent memory: joyless, arbitrary, spiritually empty. And that was before a 20-something guy bounded into the store and started screaming: \u201cAlexa! Alexa! Alexa!\u201d\\r\\n<br>Some of the items Amazon 4-Star hawks are Amazon products, naturally: the Amazon Echo home assistant (which ordinarily answers to \u201cAlexa\u201d), the Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet, the Amazon Fire TV Stick, plenty of AmazonBasics items, including a five-way headphone splitter ($9.49, $8.07 for Prime; 4.4 rating). Run-of-the-mill vertical integration stuff. Not my ecosystem, but fine.\\r\\n<br>Some sections are arranged logically: children\u2019s toys, kitchen items, smart-home tools. (I use \u201csection\u201d very loosely. On the wall, each one is perhaps a couple of feet wide.) And each item tag has a price, a lower price for Amazon Prime members (sometimes) and an average star rating (along with the number of customers who rated it).\\r\\n<p>About that 4-Star name, though. Thing is, I know there\u2019s a fifth star. Four stars out of five is already a concession. What\u2019s on offer aren\u2019t the most premium products, but rather ones that are pretty good. \\r\\n<br>Add to that the fact that I found several items in the store that actually have a rating below four stars. Say, the iRobot Braava Jet 240 wet mop ($199\/$169; 3.8), or Don\u2019t Lose Your Cool, ($19.99\/$10.42; 2.4), a party game that includes a contraption you strap to your head that measures rises in heart rate and which presumably was tested on customers shopping here.\\r\\n<br>You trust a store because you trust how it was curated. That\u2019s true whether it\u2019s Walmart or Dover Street Market. But there is little oversight here beyond the Amazon imprimatur. In several places, products are arranged by theme. Again, I use \u201ctheme\u201d loosely: \u201cTop Selling Around NYC,\u201d \u201cMost Wished for Books on Amazon.\u201d\\r\\n<br>\u201cTrending Around NYC on Amazon.com.\u201d Taxonomies I have never pondered and which are utterly useless.\\r\\n<p>On the Trending table, a Lego advent calendar ($29.99; 4.7) was next to a Panasonic Arc 5 electric razor ($199.99\/$99.99; 4.5), which was next to a tub of CeraVe moisturizing cream ($15.06; 4.6) and just inches from Michelle Obama\u2019s memoir, \u201cBecoming\u201d ($32.50\/$19.50; 4.8). \\r\\n<br>A couple of tables away, a Big Gulp-size Yankee Candle in a surprisingly not acrid Christmas Cookie scent ($17.99; 4.1) was next to \u201cLess,\u201d a novel by Andrew Sean Greer that won the Pulitzer Prize ($15.99\/$10.87; 3.7).\\r\\n<p>These are chaotic arrangements, on tables set among floor paths that resemble a field maze. Decoration and filigree is minimal. There were a couple of afterthought cardboard trees on the electronic gift guide table, but not much beyond that. Almost every 10 minutes, a UPS handler would roll in a hand truck filled with those signature Amazon boxes, presumably loading up the store with inventory.\\r\\n<br>Now look, I rely on Amazon Prime just like the next hypocrite, and I understand how one\u2019s needs aren\u2019t cleanly categorizable. But this store treats commerce like a tornado. On one table, there was a tossed-together collection of light winter jackets less organized than what you\u2019d find in the Times Square H&M; underneath the table was a set of cardboard boxes with sizes written in marker on the side. Forget farm-to-table; this is pallet-to-checkout.\\r\\n<p>Maybe I was using the wrong approach \u2014 absorbing the store as a whole, and not like a warehouse picker in search of a specific item. So I went through my mental inventory of home problems that need solving. \\r\\n<br>Inspired by a friend\u2019s recent purchase of a 75-inch television (insert drool emoji), I sought out the electronics section. But there was only one option, a meager 55 inches. There was an impressive-looking Sonos Beam Soundbar ($399\/$349; 4.1), but that felt like something to address later, once the main itch had been scratched.\\r\\n<br>Then, a manageable ask. Over Thanksgiving weekend, my mother gave serious side eye to the pan I use to make eggs, which after years of use resembles something extracted from a barn on \u201cAmerican Pickers.\u201d Easy enough. I went to the kitchen section but found that there were none. \\r\\n<br>Well, strictly speaking, there was one: a tree-ornament version, the 3.5-inch Lodge miniature skillet ($6.25\/$4.69; 4.4), good for a single egg or a quick wallop on the head, which, by this point, would have been sweet relief.\\r\\n<br>Amazon 4-Star 72 Spring Street, 212-966-2462; amazon.com\/4-star\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"technology.14.txt\",\"id\":400461429},{\"title\":\"Israeli Software Helped Saudis Spy on Khashoggi, Lawsuit Says\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"A Saudi dissident based in Canada claims the Saudi government planted spyware in his phone to eavesdrop on his talks with Jamal Khashoggi.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>LONDON \u2014 A Saudi dissident close to the murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi has filed a lawsuit charging that an Israeli software company helped the royal court take over his smartphone and spy on his communications with Mr. Khashoggi.\\r\\n<br>The lawsuit puts new pressure on the company, the NSO Group, and on the government of Israel, which licenses the company\u2019s sales to foreign governments of its spyware, known as Pegasus. More broadly, the suit also calls new attention to Israel\u2019s increasingly open alliance with Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf monarchies.\\r\\n<br>Saudi Arabia and its allies like the United Arab Emirates have never recognized the Jewish state but have quietly found common cause with it in opposition to Iran. Since the Arab Spring uprisings, Israel and those monarchies also appear to have found an alignment of interest in defending the established Arab order.\\r\\n<br>The lawsuit, filed in Israel by the Montreal-based Saudi dissident Omar Abdulaziz, follows parallel suits by journalists, activists and others charging that the NSO Group improperly helped the governments of Mexico and the United Arab Emirates spy on their smartphones even though the individuals had no criminal records and posed no threat of violence.\\r\\n<p>The human rights group Amnesty International has also recently accused the NSO Group of helping Saudi Arabia spy on a member of the organization\u2019s staff. Amnesty said last week that it was considering legal action after the Israeli defense ministry rejected a request to revoke NSO Group\u2019s license to export its spyware.\\r\\n<br>\u201cBy continuing to approve of NSO Group, the Ministry of Defense is practically admitting to knowingly cooperating with NSO Group as their software is used to commit human rights abuses,\u201d said Molly Malekar, the programs director of Amnesty International\u2019s Israeli office.\\r\\n<br>In a statement on Sunday, the NSO Group said its products were \u201clicensed for the sole use of providing governments and law enforcement agencies the ability to lawfully fight terrorism and crime.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Contracts for use of its software \u201care only provided after a full vetting and licensing by the Israeli government,\u201d the company said, adding: \u201cWe do not tolerate misuse of our products. If there is suspicion of misuse, we investigate it and take the appropriate actions, including suspending or terminating a contract.\u201d\\r\\n<br>The spyware allows its customers to secretly listen to calls, record keystrokes, read messages, and track internet history on a targeted phone. It also enables customers to use a phone\u2019s microphone and camera as surveillance devices.\\r\\n<p>Because of those sweepingly invasive capabilities, Israel classifies the spyware as a weapon. The company must obtain approval from the Defense Ministry for its sale to foreign governments. Saudi Arabia paid $55 million last year for its use, according to Israeli news reports.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Abdulaziz, the plaintiff of the new lawsuit, is a 27-year-old Saudi who sought asylum in Canada and lives in Montreal. In the aftermath of the Arab Spring uprisings, he had become popular among Saudis for online videos and social media commentary criticizing the rulers of the kingdom for their authoritarianism. The consulting firm McKinsey & Company identified him as an influential driver of dissent on social media.\\r\\n<br>Over the last two months, he has also gained international attention because of his friendship and collaboration with Mr. Khashoggi, a Saudi exile living in Virginia who wrote columns for The Washington Post.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Khashoggi was killed and dismembered in October in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. American intelligence agencies and many Western officials have concluded that Saudi Arabia\u2019s day-to-day ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, authorized the assassination. He has denied authorizing the killing, and Saudi officials have said that a team of agents sent to retrieve Mr. Khashoggi decided on their own to kill him instead.\\r\\n<br>The lawsuit claims that in the months before the killing, the royal court had access to Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s communications about opposition projects with Mr. Abdulaziz because of the spyware on Mr. Abdulaziz\u2019s phone.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Abdulaziz has said he was also targeted by some of the operatives close to Prince Mohammed who have been linked to the Khashoggi killing as part of a campaign to bring home or silence Saudi dissidents abroad. After pestering him for months with messages urging him to return to the kingdom, two Saudi emissaries met him in Montreal last May to pressure him in person.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Abdulaziz covertly recorded the conversations. \u201cThere are two scenarios,\u201d one of the agents told him, referring to him in the third person as Omar. In the first option, \u201cOmar is a beneficiary or a winner, because he is going back home,\u201d an emissary told him. \u201cThe second side, the state, is a winner and is happy as well,\u201d the emissary added, suggesting that the kingdom might pay also Mr. Abdulaziz large sums of money.\\r\\n<p>If he declined, however, \u201cOmar is a loser because he is going to jail,\u201d the emissary said, and he said Mr. Abdulaziz might be apprehended at an airport. The Saudi emissaries said falsely that Mr. Khashoggi was also considering returning to the kingdom.\\r\\n<br>The emissaries said they had been sent by Saud al-Qahtani, a close adviser to the crown prince who has been the target of United States sanctions for his alleged role in the Khashoggi killing. A statement announcing the sanctions also identified him as the supervisor of the intelligence agent who led that operation. But the emissaries made clear that their orders had ultimately come from the crown prince.\\r\\n<br>They promised Mr. Abdulaziz that the day after he landed in Saudi Arabia he would meet with Prince Mohammed and could ask him for anything. They said they had already booked a hotel room for Mr. Abdulaziz in Jeddah.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Abdulaziz declined to return to the kingdom and also refused a request to visit the Saudi embassy in Ottawa for further discussions. That request began to look more ominous after Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death in the Istanbul consulate, Mr. Abdulaziz has said.\\r\\n<br>The next month, in June, he received a text message that looked like a link to track the shipment of a package but turned out to mask a link to the NSO Group\u2019s spyware, according to court papers filed with the lawsuit.\\r\\n<br>In August, a research group at the University of Toronto that studies online surveillance notified Mr. Abdulaziz that his phone might have been hacked. The research group, Citizen Lab, later concluded that the Saudi government was behind it.\\r\\n<br>Around the same time as the arrival of the fake text message, Saudi security forces carried out a raid with search dogs in the middle of the night at the home of Mr. Abdulaziz\u2019s family in Jeddah. Two of his brothers were arrested and remain in prison without charges, according to the court papers.\\r\\n<p>Mr. Abdulaziz \u201chas also learned that the security personnel in the detention center are using torture against them and are subjecting them to inhumane and humiliating treatment, all in order to put pressure on the plaintiff to force him to stop his activism,\u201d the court papers state.\\r\\n<br>It was also during the period after the spying began that Mr. Abdulaziz and Mr. Khashoggi stepped up their plans for various social media campaigns to counter Saudi government propaganda. Mr. Khashoggi sent Mr. Abdulaziz $5,000 to subsidize that effort.\\r\\n<br>The lawsuit was filed by an Israeli lawyer, Alaa Mahajna, in cooperation with Mazen Masri, a lecturer at the City University of London.\\r\\n<br>The lawyers say in the court papers that they intend to argue that the resulting exposure of the collaboration between Mr. Abdulaziz and Mr. Khashoggi \u201ccontributed in a significant manner to the decision to murder Mr. Khashoggi.\u201d\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"world.2.txt\",\"id\":2077851121},{\"title\":\"Phys Ed: The Best Foods for Athletes\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"More fat? More carbs? How should we eat for peak athletic performance?\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>More fat? More carbs? What kind? How much? When? \\r\\n<br>Questions about what constitutes an ideal and practical diet for competitive athletes consume and confuse many athletes, as well as their coaches and families. But a new, comprehensive review about the science of sports nutrition published recently in Science provides a lucid overview of what currently is known \u2014 and not known \u2014 about how athletes should eat.\\r\\n<br>To find out more about these and other topics, I spoke with Louise Burke, a sports dietitian and professor at Australian Catholic University who has worked with many elite Australian sports teams. She wrote the new review with her husband John Hawley, the director of the Mary MacKillop Institute for Health Research at Australian Catholic University. What follows are edited and summarized excerpts from our conversation.\\r\\n<br>Q. In your review, you write that \u201ccarbohydrates are the predominant and critical substrate for working muscles\u201d and that \u201cthe availability of carbohydrates, rather than fat, wins gold medals.\u201d So athletes should be eating and drinking carbs?\\r\\n<br>A. Broadly speaking, if you had to stretch a big umbrella over the whole sports world and say, what dietary approach will bring the most performance benefits to the most types of athletes, then, yes, a high-carb diet would usually be the answer.\\r\\n<p>Q. In practical terms, how much carbohydrate are we talking about, especially during competition?\\r\\n<br>A. Based on what we know now, it looks like 30 to 60 grams of carbohydrates per hour during endurance events lasting several hours would be the sweet spot for most athletes. [For reference, a typical packet of a sports gel contains around 30 grams of carbohydrates, as does a banana or most single-serving bottles of sports drinks.]\\r\\n<br>Q. Some people, including me, might find it difficult to stomach so much food or drink during a race. Any advice?\\r\\n<br>A. Train your gut, just like you train your muscles. In the buildup to an event, practice with the foods or drinks you plan to have during the event, adding more, slowly. Some people find that combining multiple kinds of carbs, like glucose with fructose, are more tolerable than either one alone, probably because they are metabolized along slightly different pathways in the body. It\u2019s also clear that you can swish sports drinks around in your mouth and spit without swallowing and your brain will interpret this as meaning you have more energy available. I think that\u2019s fascinating and it can be useful, if you can\u2019t stomach more carbs just then.\\r\\n<br>Q. The big controversy in sports nutrition right now seems to involve high-fat diets, which some people claim are better for performance than high-carb diets. Do we know whether one approach is really better for athletes?\\r\\n<br>A. [Dr. Burke noted that \u201cthe issue is so much more complicated than the Twitterverse would have people believe.\u201d Carbohydrates remain muscles\u2019 preferred fuel choice during exercise, she explained, because they can be metabolized so quickly. But our bodies contain much larger stores of fat than carbohydrates, so it makes intuitive sense that we might want to become better able to use that substantial fuel source, perhaps by eating a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet.]\\r\\n<p>Q. But in the real world, do high-fat diets improve performance?\\r\\n<br>A. It depends on what kind of event someone competes in. In long, relatively low-intensity events like ultramarathons, fat might provide enough fuel. But even then, if someone wants to sprint at the end, they are going to need carbohydrates for that burst of exertion. For more intense events, there is evidence that high-fat diets impair performance. In our research with elite race walkers, we found that after they went on a high-fat diet, they could not train as hard and their competitive results suffered.\\r\\n<br>Q. So athletes shouldn\u2019t try high-fat diets?\\r\\n<br>A. I wouldn\u2019t say that at all. Some athletes love them. And we know that high-fat diets stimulate different molecular changes in the muscles than high-carb diets, some of which could be beneficial for performance.\\r\\n<br>[A practical compromise approach that allows competitors\u2019 bodies to adjust to using both carbohydrates and fats efficiently, Dr. Burke continued, involves a technique called \u201ctrain-high, sleep-low,\u201d during which an athlete works out strenuously in the afternoon to deplete his or her body of carbohydrate stores, eats a high-fat, low-carbohydrate dinner, completes a long, slow workout in the morning, and then consumes a gloriously large, high-carbohydrate breakfast before training vigorously again. Dr. Burke threads this technique occasionally into her own training for marathons and other events, she says. ]\\r\\n<br>Q. What about protein?\\r\\n<br>A. That\u2019s an interesting topic. We know that most athletes need more protein than the standard dietary allowances call for, to help in muscle repair. But we also are learning, by studying athletes, how important sufficient protein is likely to be for nonathletes, especially older people, if they want to maintain muscle mass.\\r\\n<br>Q. With all the emerging science about nutrition and sports, what overall advice would you give a recreational athlete about how to eat?\\r\\n<br>A. Talk to a sports dietitian. I think many recreational athletes get caught up in trends and forget the basics. If you are an Olympic athlete, then, yes, the minutiae of your diet\u2019s composition and timing are very consequential. The rest of us should concentrate on simple, healthy eating.\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"health.6.txt\",\"id\":1019667209},{\"title\":\"600 Million Years Ago, the First Scavengers Lurked in Dark Ocean Gardens\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"The bizarre organisms of the Ediacaran Period have long puzzled researchers. Fossil discoveries suggest these ecosystems may have been more complicated than once thought.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>Some 635 million years ago, as the Earth shook off massive shrouds of glacial ice, an alien world blossomed on the ocean floors. \\r\\n<br>No complex animals prowled the seas of the Ediacaran Period. Instead, the depths held microbial mats and strange, frond-like creatures that resembled nothing alive today. Paleontologists have suggested that this was a sort of Garden of Eden, a simple ecosystem wiped away by the more vibrant fauna of the following Cambrian Period. \\r\\n<br>But recent research is complicating this view, suggesting that Ediacaran ecosystems were more complex than previously thought. Fossils also hint at the beginnings of a massive shift: scavenging that later evolved into predation.\\r\\n<br>\u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of a major change in the ecosystem of the Earth, an irrevocable change,\u201d said Mary Droser, a paleobiologist at the University of California, Riverside. \u201cThe ability to eat another animal is a big deal, and is a major ecological and biological innovation.\u201d\\r\\n<p>The fossils of the Ediacaran, found in desolate locations like Namibia and South Australia, have been notoriously controversial and difficult to interpret. They include strange, quilted blobs; stationary filter-feeders; and organisms like enormous ferns, some up to eight feet long. \\r\\n<br>\u201cAt first, they were all thought to be jellyfish,\u201d said Simon A.F. Darroch, a paleontologist at Vanderbilt University. \u201cLater, others argued that they were stem-animals or lichens.\u201d (Stem-animals were proto-animals: not quite plants, not yet creatures.) \\r\\n<br>Scientists also have debated how sophisticated these seafloor ecologies were, Dr. Darroch added. A complex ecosystem holds multiple species with a multitude of feeding strategies, like a modern forest or a reef. A simple ecosystem comprises only a few species with the same basic strategies.\\r\\n<br>Looking at the Ediacaran\u2019s apparently uncomplicated organisms \u2014 without legs or obvious guts \u2014 most researchers assumed this ecosystem was on the simple side. But in a study recently published in Nature Ecology and Evolution, Dr. Darroch and his colleagues surveyed seafloor fossils from various parts of the Ediacaran and concluded that the early stages of the period featured surprisingly intricate communities. \\r\\n<p>Dive into the Ediacaran seas, and you\u2019d see sediments covered in thick sheets of green or white microbes. There were no deep burrowers here; the ocean mud had the solidity and stickiness of a tile floor after a fraternity party. \\r\\n<p>The few multicellular organisms grazed slowly on the congealed mats or sat atop them, using different body shapes to pluck nutrients from the currents. Sea jellies, or something like them, may have floated in the open waters \u2014 nobody\u2019s sure.\\r\\n<br>Many of these organisms had an architecture unlike any seen in modern organisms, said Martin Smith, a paleontologist at Durham University in England. While they may have appeared plantlike, they lived in waters too deep for sunlight to penetrate. \\r\\n<br>Even their precise shapes are unknown. Some may have been folded into complex patterns; others, inflated like a water bed.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThey probably grew very slowly,\u201d Dr. Smith said, \u201carriving as spores on a virgin seafloor after a mudslide or land slip, then reproducing asexually to form interconnected colonies that gradually populated the seafloor.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Dr. Darroch and his colleagues suggest that different feeding strategies were at the root of this unexpected diversity, but Dr. Smith finds it hard to imagine such organisms feeding in radically different ways. \\r\\n<br>Instead, the organisms may have competed with one another with varying reproductive strategies, he suggested. Some were able to alter their shapes according to their surroundings and then to spread their spores over a greater distance.\\r\\n<p>Even with such unexpected diversity, the Ediacaran was a still world, without much in the way of predation. But dead organisms were an easy resource, Dr. Droser said, and some animals began to take advantage. \\r\\n<br>According to a recent paper Dr. Droser co-wrote in the journal Emerging Topics in Life Sciences, a new set of fossils shows the oldest known traces of such scavenging. Recovered from the Flinders Ranges of South Australia, the rocks hold beautifully preserved fossils of Ediacaran organisms, with tiny passages carved through them.\\r\\n<br>[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\\r\\n<br>Dr. Droser and James Gehling, a paleontologist at the South Australian Museum, suggest that these burrows were made by small animals nibbling through microbe mats decaying under thin drifts of sand, and devouring the dead organisms they found in the mats. \\r\\n<br>In a world where nothing dug very deep, burrowing would have been a biological and ecological innovation.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThe scavenging occurred after the organisms were buried, so we know that they were dead,\u201d Dr. Droser said. \u201cEating a dead animal requires more oxygen and also a metabolism that can digest it.\u201d\\r\\n<br>But Dr. Smith disagrees, pointing out that signs of scavenging after the Ediacaran Period are not like these. Scientists tend to find elaborate patterns in fossils, left by animals exploiting every inch of decaying organic matter. \\r\\n<br>\u201cThese Ediacaran burrowers seem not to care that they\u2019ve just passed through a potential meal,\u201d Dr. Smith said. \\r\\n<p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t sound like a great strategy for a scavenger, less still for a predator,\u201d he added. \u201cBut perhaps these early organisms were still learning the ropes.\u201d \\r\\n<br>Either way, the advent of simple scavenging and burrowing heralded larger changes to come. Scavenging may have been a steppingstone to active predation, and the evolution of the first predators kicked off a massive arms race. Once prey began attempting to escape, defending themselves or fighting back, competition and natural selection began to escalate.\\r\\n<br>There are clues that something was changing toward the end of the Ediacaran, Dr. Darroch said: signs of movement in the mud fall dramatically, as do the number of species recorded \u2014 symptoms of an ecosystem under stress. \\r\\n<br>As the microbial mats disappeared in a world of burrowers, the fragile species that lived off them went, too. The appearance of more recognizable animals \u2014 mobile and powerful, able to punch through the mats and devour other living organisms \u2014 might have caused a biologically driven mass extinction.\\r\\n<br>The Cambrian explosion gave rise to many recognizable animal groups, and for a time these overshadowed the strange, silent gardens of the Ediacaran. But the key to how multicellular ecosystems developed seems to lie in sandstones left by those chilly seas, in an ecosystem much more diverse than previously suspected.\\r\\n<br>\u201cLife has impacted our world today from the production of oxygen to churning up soil,\u201d Dr. Droser said. \u201cWe can see in the Ediacaran the firsts of a number of these biological and ecological processes that later became essential to our planet.\u201d\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"science.4.txt\",\"id\":-609817461},{\"title\":\"\u2018Yellow Vests\u2019 Riot in Paris, but Their Anger Is Rooted Deep in France\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"With little organization, fueled by frustration, the protests have moved from poor rural regions to the banks of the Seine, the scene of riots this weekend.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>GU\u00c9RET, France \u2014 At the bare bottom of Florian Dou\u2019s shopping cart at the discount supermarket, there was a packet of $6 sausages and not much else.

And it has made Mr. Dou angry.\\r\\n<br>So he used what money he had left and drove 250 miles to join the fiery protests on Saturday in Paris, where the police moved in with tear gas, water cannon and rubber bullets.\\r\\n<br>\u201cWe knew they were sent in to get rid of us,\u201d he said the day after, \u201cand believe me, they were not into Mr. Nice Guy.\u201d But he vows the protesters are not going anywhere.\\r\\n<p>The \u201cYellow Vest\u201d protests he is a part of present an extraordinary venting of rage and resentment by ordinary working people, aimed at the mounting inequalities that have eroded their lives. The unrest began in response to rising gas taxes and has been building in intensity over the past three weeks, peaking on Saturday.\\r\\n<br>With little organization and relying mostly on social media, they have moved spontaneously from France\u2019s poor rural regions over the last month to the banks of the Seine, where they have now become impossible to ignore.\\r\\n<p>On Sunday, President Emmanuel Macron toured the graffiti-scrawled monuments of the capital and the damage along some of the richest shopping streets in Europe. All around France, the protests left three dead and more than 260 wounded, with more than 400 arrested. Mr. Macron convened a crisis cabinet meeting, weighing whether to impose a state of emergency.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Macron has previously insisted that, unlike past French governments, he will not back down in the face of popular resistance to reforms like a loosening of labor laws. It\u2019s a harder line than many other western European countries have taken.\\r\\n<p>The protesters ridicule him as a president of the rich and say he is trying to balance his budgets on their backs as he remains deaf to their concerns.\\r\\n<br>But if it was the shattered glass and burned cars along Rue de Rivoli or Boulevard Haussmann in Paris that finally got Mr. Macron\u2019s attention, the movement \u2014 named for the roadside safety vests worn by demonstrators \u2014 has in fact welled up from silent towns like Gu\u00e9ret, an administrative center of 13,000 people, lost in the small valleys of central France.\\r\\n<br>Far from any big city, it sits in one of the poorest departments of France, where the public hospital is the biggest employer. The cafe in the main square is empty by midafternoon. The hulks of burned-out cars dot the moribund train station\u2019s tiny parking lot, abandoned by citizens too poor to maintain them.\\r\\n<br>In places like these, a quiet fear gnaws at households: What happens when the money runs out around the 20th? What do I put in the refrigerator with nothing left in the account and the electricity bill to pay? Which meal should I skip today? How do I tell my wife again there is no going out this weekend?\\r\\n<p>The stories of Mr. Dou\u2019s neighbors who also joined the protests were much like his own. Inside Laetitia Depourtoux\u2019s freezer were hunks of frozen meat, a twice-a-year gift from her farmer-father, and the six-member family\u2019s meat ration.\\r\\n<br>On these cold nights, Joel Decoux\u2019s oven burned the wood he chopped himself because he can\u2019t afford gas for heating.\\r\\n<p>It is not deep poverty, but ever-present unease in the small cities, towns and villages over what is becoming known as \u201cthe other France,\u201d away from the glitzy Parisian boulevards that were the scene of rioting this weekend.\\r\\n<br>\u201cWe live with stress,\u201d said Fabrice Girardin, 46, a former carpet-layer who now looks after other people\u2019s pets to get by. \u201cEvery month, at the end of the month, we say, \u2018Will there be enough to eat?\u2019 \u201d\\r\\n<br>Since the acidic portrait of Gu\u00e9ret in novels by a famous native son, the anti-Semitic 20th-century writer Marcel Jouhandeau, the town is used to being mocked as the epitome of provincial backwardness.\\r\\n<br>The Yellow Vest protesters, the descendants of those who inspired Jouhandeau\u2019s characters, can now be found waiting at the road blocks as you come into town \u2014 truck and school-bus drivers, nurses, out-of-work electricians, housewives, warehouse handlers, part-time civil servants and construction workers on disability aid.\\r\\n<p>Mr. Dou \u2014 who says his 9-year-old son has never been on vacation and his gross salary of 1,300 euros a month, about $1,475, \u201cdisappears immediately in the bills\u201d \u2014 was among them. There is little left after high taxes and costly utilities such as electricity.\\r\\n<br>To protest, he and the other protesters wait at night in the middle of the roundabouts, in the rain and cold and mud under makeshift tarpaulin shelters and tents in the darkness of early morning. \u201cThe People\u2019s \u00c9lys\u00e9e\u201d is scrawled on one, mocking Mr. Macron\u2019s \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, seat of the presidency. \u201cMacron, he\u2019s with the bosses, Macron, he\u2019s against the people,\u201d a singer intoned in a reggaelike jingle from the radio.\\r\\n<p>Mr. Dou said he had joined the movement from the beginning, and he was an assiduous presence over several days last week on the traffic circles at Gu\u00e9ret. He was there at 11 p.m. on a rainy Thursday, after putting in several hours that morning, and he was there the next day as well.\\r\\n<br>\u201cWe don\u2019t even need the social networks anymore,\u201d he said.\\r\\n<br>His motivation, he said, was to \u201crecover the country\u2019s priorities. The values of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity.\u201d The gas tax \u201cwas what set it all off.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Now, he felt that the Yellow Vest protesters really have the government on the run.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThey don\u2019t know what to do. They\u2019re really in a panic.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Virtually every car that passes honks in sympathy. But the protesters know that their shouts grow faint over the long distance to real power in Paris, and that is what has propelled them to move their demonstrations there.\\r\\n<p>By Friday, Mr. Dou was preparing to make the drive in a shared car up to Paris: checking in with his comrades at the traffic circle and buying last-minute supplies \u2014 including solution to protect his eyes from tear gas.\\r\\n<br>Yoann Decoux, an out-of-work electrical lineman in his 30s who was presented by Gu\u00e9ret\u2019s Yellow Vest protesters as their spokesman, had been arrested in Paris the week before.\\r\\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been in political demonstrations before,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we said, enough\u2019s enough.\u201d\\r\\n<br>\u201cThey don\u2019t even know how we get by with our tiny little salaries,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are humans too, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d He was getting by with vegetables and help from his part-time farmer-father.\\r\\n<br>None of the Gu\u00e9ret protesters expressed allegiance to any politician: Most said politics disgusted them.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThey are all the same,\u201d Mr. Dou said.\\r\\n<br>When Gu\u00e9ret\u2019s mayor, Michel Vergnier, a veteran Socialist with decades of connections in Paris, went to see the protesters, they were not welcoming.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThere\u2019s a rejection of politicians,\u201d Mr. Vergnier said. \u201cThey are outside all political and union organizations.\u201d\\r\\n<p>It was the end of the month. To a man and woman the Yellow Vest protesters of Gu\u00e9ret said their accounts were tapped out.\\r\\n<br>\u201cRight now, I\u2019m at zero,\u201d Mr. Girardin said. His wife had done the shopping with 40 euros the day before, a Wednesday. Now there was nothing left to get them through the weekend.\\r\\n<p>\u201cYou get to the end of the month, there\u2019s nothing,\u201d he said.\\r\\n<br>That is why Mr. Macron\u2019s plans to raise the gasoline tax, modest an increment as it may seem, was the final straw for so many, the spark that finally set off a seething rage that has been building for years.\\r\\n<br>There was no gas in his car, said Mr. Girardin, a carpet-layer who quit a job with a stagnant 1,200-euro a month salary to strike out on his own. But he was no better off now.\\r\\n<br>\u201cOnce we\u2019ve finished paying all of our bills, there\u2019s no money left.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Tonight\u2019s meal: noodles, with maybe a little ground beef. \u201cI\u2019d like to be able to take my wife to the restaurant from time to time, but I can\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Girardin said. Weighed down by financial stress, she had gone into a depression. \u201cShe\u2019s totally closed in on herself,\u201d he said.\\r\\n<br>Up the road the next morning, Ms. Depourtoux, a night-shift nurse at the hospital, was up at 6:30 a.m. with her husband, Olivier, an optician, to see their three daughters off to school in the darkness. Their modest house at a country intersection at the edge of town was pleasant but not spacious.\\r\\n<p>She gently mocked him because \u201cthere is never any gas in your car.\u201d With four children and many bills, their money \u2014 1,800 euros a month for her, 1,500 for him \u2014 was \u201cvery quickly gone,\u201d Mr. Depourtoux said.\\r\\n<br>The bank refused to lend them any more money. Both had joined the Yellow Vests, and both had gone to Paris the preceding weekend to demonstrate. \u201cAs long as it continues, we are with it,\u201d he said.\\r\\n<p>\u201cWe live, but we\u2019ve got to be careful. We can\u2019t go to the restaurant. All the little pleasures of life are gone,\u201d Mr. Depourtoux said. His parents, after a lifetime of work, were reduced to penury: his father in a nursing home and his mother forced to accept meals from charity.\\r\\n<br>She fills the freezer with deep-discount frozen food from the hard discounter Lidl. They wait to get paid to fill up the car and to do the shopping.\\r\\n<br>\u201cWe just don\u2019t make it to the end of the month,\u201d said Elodie Marton, a mother of four who had joined the protesters at the demonstration outside town. \u201cI\u2019ve got 10 euros left,\u201d she said, as a dozen others tried to get themselves warm around an iron-barrel fire.\\r\\n<br>\u201cLuckily we\u2019ve got some animals at the house\u201d \u2014 chickens, ducks \u2014 \u201cand we keep them for the end of the month,\u201d she said. \u201cIt sounds brutal, but my priority is the children,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re fed up and we\u2019re angry!\u2019 shouted her husband, Thomas Schwint, a cement hauler on a temporary 1,200-euro contract.\\r\\n<br>To a man and woman the Gu\u00e9ret protesters expressed fury at the government, and determination to keep going.\\r\\n<br>\u201cTheir response has poisoned the situation even more,\u201d Mr. Depourtoux said. \u201cThe citizens have asked for lower taxes, and they\u2019re saying, \u2018Ecology,\u2019\u201d he said in a reference to Mr. Macron\u2019s speech of last week where he outlined France\u2019s plans to transition from fossil-based fuels to renewable energy.\\r\\n<br>At the roundabout, Laurent Aufrere, a truck driver, was deciding which of that day\u2019s meals to skip.\\r\\n<br>\u201cIf I stop rolling, I die. This is not nothing,\u201d Mr. Aufrere said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening right now is a citizen uprising.\u201d\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"world.1.txt\",\"id\":-1598217453},{\"title\":\"DealBook Briefing: The Trade War Isn\u2019t Over. It\u2019s Just on Hold.\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"There\u2019s still plenty that can go wrong even now the U.S. and China have called a temporary trade truce.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>Good Monday. Want this by email? Sign up here.\\r\\n<h2>Don\u2019t think that the trade war is going away\\r\\n<br>President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China struck a deal on Saturday evening to ease trade tensions between their two countries. Global markets breathed a sigh of relief, with U.S. stock futures rising significantly \u2014 but there\u2019s plenty of negotiating left to do, and little sign yet that meaningful progress can be made.\\r\\n<br>What happened: Over dinner at the Group of 20 meeting in Buenos Aires (on the menu: grilled sirloin and seasonal vegetable salad), Mr. Trump agreed that the U.S. would hold off on raising tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods to 25 percent from a current level of 10 percent. Mr. Xi said China would lower levies on U.S. car imports, Mr. Trump tweeted.\\r\\n<br>Why it happened: The two sides recognized that they were both suffering from a prolonged trade battle. China\u2019s economy has slowed more than expected, partly because of the tariffs, and U.S. businesses and stocks have been hurting from the uncertainty. Tyler Cowen of Bloomberg Opinion argues that Mr. Trump deserves some real credit for forcing action on many of the long-running disputes between the two countries.\\r\\n<br>What could go wrong: China might not follow through on promises to toughen protections for intellectual property and to further open its markets. Hard-liners in the Trump administration may derail negotiations. And experts are skeptical that fruitful progress can be made by a March 1 deadline.\\r\\n<p>More G-20 news: Mr. Trump reportedly said \u201cGet me out of here\u201d onstage before a group photo. And China appeared to have partly censored a statement by the U.S. Embassy in Beijing about the agreement.\\r\\n<h2>Trump threatens to withdraw from Nafta\\r\\n<br>On the sidelines of the G-20 meeting, President Trump signed his new trade deal with Canada and Mexico. But he added that he would waste no time in ditching its predecessor.\\r\\n<br>What he said: \u201cI will be formally terminating Nafta shortly,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One during his flight back to the U.S.\\r\\n<br>Why he said it: He hopes to force House Democrats to approve the revision of Nafta, known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Some Democratic lawmakers fear that the new deal is not in the interest of American workers.\\r\\n<br>The risk it poses: \u201cIf he follows through on his threat, congressional leaders will have six months to pass the new trade measure,\u201d Glenn Thrush of the NYT writes. \u201cIf no deal can be reached, both versions of the treaty would be void, which would result in far more restrictive trade that could have a severe impact on industry and agriculture in all three nations.\u201d\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<h2>Is it time for crypto to catch up with the law?\\r\\n<br>Late last week, Andrew sat down with the S.E.C. chairman, Jay Clayton, at a TimesTalk event in New York to discuss the future of blockchain and cryptocurrency. (You can watch the discussion here.) Some highlights:\\r\\n<br>Mr. Clayton reaffirmed a need for caution. On the topic of initial coin offerings, he said, \u201cWe tried to get the word out that although the trading looks like the trading you would see on Nasdaq or on the New York Stock Exchange, these markets do not have the same kinds of safeguards for you.\u201d\\r\\n<br>But he sees no need to modernize for modernity\u2019s sake. \u201cMy view is that our rules have stood the test of time,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to change rules just to fit a technology.\u201d Any regulation that it does impose on crypto, he said, is \u201cnot picking winners and losers\u201d but \u201cprotecting investors.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Cryptocurrencies are still struggling. Bitcoin remains under $4,000, down about 80 percent from its high last December. It\u2019s hurting in part because of regulatory scrutiny, and many people in the community would like some support from the establishment.\\r\\n<br>The bottom line: For a while, it looked as if laws might have to be changed to work with crypto. Mr. Clayton\u2019s comments hinted that crypto might be the one to change, to meet the law.\\r\\n<h2>Coming up: World powers seek new rules to save the climate\\r\\n<br>Officials from around the globe are meeting in Katowice, Poland, today at the United Nations\u2019s annual climate talks.\\r\\n<br>Big decisions are on the agenda. Bloomberg explains that delegates \u201cwill seek to transform pledges made in Paris three years ago into an international rule book aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d We\u2019re now in the hard part, where goals must be turned into functioning policy.\\r\\n<br>They will look to the private sector for help. \u201cWhile government leadership on climate is essential, 70 percent of world economic activity is in the private sector,\u201d President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Andrew Holness of Jamaica write in a WSJ op-ed. \u201cHumanity\u2019s ability to correct course depends on how quickly companies adapt.\u201d\\r\\n<p>President Trump remains uninterested. A statement from the G-20 meeting explains that \u201cthe U.S. reiterates its decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and affirms its strong commitment to economic growth and energy access and security, utilizing all sources and technologies, while protecting the environment.\u201d\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<h2>Starwood missed a chance to spot its huge data breach years ago\\r\\n<br>Last week\u2019s revelation that hackers stole the personal data of up to 500 million Starwood guests drew outrage. But experts told Robert McMillan of the WSJ that the company should have used the discovery of a 2015 security intrusion to uncover this breach:\\r\\n<br>Marriott says that the 2015 incident was different and not related to the attack made public Friday. But security specialists say that while it\u2019s not unusual for breach investigations to miss a second intruder, a more thorough investigation into the 2015 intrusion could have uncovered the attackers, who instead were able to lurk in its reservation system for three more years.\\r\\n<br>\u201cWith all the resources they have, they should have been able to isolate hackers back in 2015,\u201d said Andrei Barysevich, a researcher with the security company Recorded Future Inc.\\r\\n<br>Marriott, which bought Starwood in 2016, will pay for the breach: New York\u2019s attorney general and European regulators are both investigating the episode, and Marriott may become the first company to pay a huge fine under Europe\u2019s new data protection law.\\r\\n<br>Shares in Marriott fell 5 percent on Friday and will probably drop again today.\\r\\n<br>Meanwhile, not only were customers\u2019 personal details compromised in the hacking, but their valuable rewards points may have been stolen.\\r\\n<h2>Theresa May faces a tough week for her Brexit plan\\r\\n<br>The British prime minister takes her Brexit deal to a vote in Parliament next week, and the eight days leading up to that look to be painful:\\r\\n<br>\u2022 Four political parties \u2014 including the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland, a putative ally of Mrs. May\u2019s \u2014 have suggested that the prime minister was in contempt of Parliament for not publishing the government\u2019s full legal advice on Brexit.\\r\\n<br>\u2022 The Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is under growing pressure to support a second referendum on leaving the E.U., a proposal he had previously ruled out. That may be the best shot that critics have of keeping Britain in the E.U.\\r\\n<p>\u2022 Critics continue to argue that Brexit in any form would harm the British economy. Felix Salmon of Axios contends that it could even  contribute to a global economy slowdown.\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<h2>Qatar quits OPEC before a pivotal meeting on oil prices\\r\\n<br>The Middle Eastern country said this morning that it would leave the oil cartel in January to focus on its natural gas industry. It\u2019s the latest sign of divides in OPEC days ahead of a meeting at which the group is to decide how to steady the price of oil.\\r\\n<br>Qatar\u2019s leaving OPEC isn\u2019t a blow to the cartel\u2019s power, per se: The emirate is one of the cartel\u2019s smallest members. But as Bloomberg points out, \u201cits departure is most significant for any potential impact on the group\u2019s cohesion.\u201d With oil prices having plunged last month, it\u2019s crucial for the cartel to keep its members unified if it is to benefit from any production cuts.\\r\\n<br>More oil news: Royal Dutch Shell will link carbon emissions targets to executive pay.\\r\\n<h2>Revolving door\\r\\n<br>The online lender SoFi plans to lay off 100 employees, or about 7 percent of its staff, as part of a revamp of its mortgage department.\\r\\n<h2>The speed read\\r\\n<br>Deals\\r\\n<br>\u2022 UBS will take a majority stake in its Chinese joint venture, the first foreign bank to do so.

I see myself as loving husband and as a public servant \u2014 a scientist and educator who serves at the will of the public.\u201d\\r\\n<br>On Friday, Fox Broadcasting and National Geographic, which air the popular science program \u201cCosmos,\u201d said they would investigate the allegations, which were first reported on the website Patheos. On Saturday, the American Museum of Natural History in New York, where Dr. Tyson directs the Hayden Planetarium, said it was looking into the accusations as well.\\r\\n<br>Dr. Tyson, 60, remains in his positions with the show and the planetarium. But the women\u2019s accounts show how more than a year after the #MeToo movement swept into the public consciousness, accusations continue to emerge about the behavior of powerful and high-profile men.\\r\\n<p>The prolific Dr. Tyson is something of a rarity in the sciences: a star, familiar to those with no connection to his field. Essentially the public face of the natural history museum, and perhaps astronomy itself, he has been lauded for his skill in explaining scientific concepts in digestible terms. He has appeared as himself on TV shows including \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d \u201cFamily Guy\u201d and \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d and in the movie \u201cZoolander 2.\u201d\\r\\n<br>In his nearly 1,600-word Facebook post, Dr. Tyson addressed each accusation, describing two as benign gestures and suggesting that the third had not occurred.\\r\\n<br>The most recent came from Ashley Watson, who began as Dr. Tyson\u2019s assistant on \u201cCosmos\u201d in the spring. She said in an interview on Saturday that one day, he asked if she would like to come to his home to share a bottle of wine and \u201cunwind for a couple of hours.\u201d Thinking they were going to discuss extending her work on the show, she said, she agreed to come in for one glass.\\r\\n<br>In his apartment, she said, he told her that \u201cas human beings, we all need release,\u201d and asked if there were any \u201creleases\u201d she needed. Shortly after, she said, she went to leave and he asked to show her what he called a Native American handshake, which involved clasping their hands together and finding the pulse on the other person\u2019s wrist, while looking into each other\u2019s eyes. She broke it off after about 10 seconds, and stood up to leave.\\r\\n<br>As she was leaving, she said, he told her, \u201cI want you to know that I want to hug you so bad right now, but I know that if I do I\u2019ll just want more.\u201d\\r\\n<p>The next day, she said, as she was driving Dr. Tyson home from work, which was part of her job, he told her, \u201cYou say you want to be a producer, but it\u2019s always going to be an uphill battle for you because you\u2019re too distracting.\u201d\\r\\n<br>The next day, she told a supervisor what had happened, and that she had to quit. The supervisor, a line producer, asked Ms. Watson if she wanted to file a complaint, and she said no, she said. After that, the supervisor suggested she tell her co-workers that she was leaving because of a family emergency. She left the show.\\r\\n<br>In his Facebook post, Dr. Tyson described the handshake as one he uses \u201cin appreciation of people with whom I\u2019ve developed new friendships.\u201d He said that at work, Ms. Watson freely offered hugs, which he typically rejected, but that on a few occasions, he \u201cclumsily declared, \u2018If I hug you I might just want more.\u2019\u201d\\r\\n<br>\u201cMy intent was to express restrained but genuine affection,\u201d he wrote.\\r\\n<br>He wrote that Ms. Watson had come into his office after the night in his apartment and told him she had been \u201ccreeped out.\u201d He said he had \u201capologized profusely\u201d and that she had accepted the apology.\\r\\n<br>Another woman, Katelyn N. Allers, an associate professor of physics and astronomy at Bucknell University in Pennsylvania, told Patheos about meeting Dr. Tyson in 2009 at a party after a gathering of the American Astronomical Society. Dr. Allers has a tattoo of the solar system stretching from an arm to her collarbone. She said Dr. Tyson was \u201cobsessed\u201d with whether the tattoo included Pluto. \u201cHe looked for Pluto, and followed the tattoo into my dress,\u201d she told the website, describing it as \u201cuncomfortable and creepy.\u201d\\r\\n<br>In his post, Dr. Tyson noted that Pluto had been declared no longer a planet just three years earlier, \u201cso whether people include it or not in their tattoos is of great interest to me.\u201d He said he did not know until now that Dr. Allers had been uncomfortable. \u201cThat was never my intent and I\u2019m deeply sorry to have made her feel that way,\u201d he wrote.\\r\\n<p>The third woman, Tchiya Amet El Maat, has publicly accused Dr. Tyson of raping her in 1984, when they were graduate students at the University of Texas at Austin. She said in an interview on Saturday that she recalled Dr. Tyson giving her a drink of water, and that she then blacked out. When she came to, she said, she was naked on his bed. She said that when he saw she had awakened, he started having sex with her, and she passed out again. She said she was blacked out much of the night.\\r\\n<br>She filed a report with the Austin police in 2014, but according to the police report, her complaint was not investigated because Texas has a 10-year statute of limitation on sexual assault charges.\\r\\n<br>In his post, Dr. Tyson said they had a brief relationship and had been \u201cintimate only a few times, all at her apartment, but the chemistry wasn\u2019t there.\u201d He questioned the timing of the accusation \u2014 many years later, \u201cas my visibility-level took another jump\u201d \u2014 and he brought up her statements that she could not recall much of the night.\\r\\n<br>\u201cIt is as though a false memory had been implanted, which, because it never actually happened, had to be remembered as an evening she doesn\u2019t remember,\u201d he wrote.\\r\\n<br>In an email, Dr. Tyson said he would not comment beyond what he wrote on Facebook. Following his post, Ms. Amet said they had never dated and that she was \u201cin shock.\u201d\\r\\n<br>\u201cIf he is talking about me he is lying!\u201d she wrote in a text message. (Dr. Tyson did not name any of the women in his post.) Ms. Watson declined to comment on Dr. Tyson\u2019s post. Dr. Allers did not respond to a message seeking a response; she said earlier that she did not want to speak beyond what she told Patheos.\\r\\n<p>Anne Canty, a spokeswoman for the Museum of Natural History, said on Saturday that the museum was \u201creviewing\u201d the recent allegations. \u201cThe museum is not aware of any other allegations and has received no complaints,\u201d she said.\\r\\n<br>Fox and National Geographic said in a statement that they had \u201conly just become aware of the recent allegations regarding Neil deGrasse Tyson.\u201d\\r\\n<br>\u201cWe take these matters very seriously and we are reviewing the recent reports,\u201d they said. The third season of \u201cCosmos\u201d with Dr. Tyson as host, a revival of the 1980 Carl Sagan series, is scheduled to air beginning next spring.\\r\\n<br>Ann Druyan, an executive producer and director of \u201cCosmos,\u201d recalled that when Ms. Watson told her she was leaving the show, she asked why and Ms. Watson said it was a family emergency.\\r\\n<br>\u201cI asked her what kind of family emergency and she just said \u2018family emergency\u2019 again,\u201d she said. \u201cShe looked at me as if the family emergency was some disgrace or something she didn\u2019t want to talk about.

The agreement has been losing support in recent days as Democratic lawmakers, ready to take control of the House in January, reckon with fallout from the announcement last week that General Motors was planning to idle five plants in North America.\\r\\n<br>If no deal can be reached, both versions of the treaty would be void, which would result in far more restrictive trade that could have a severe impact on industry and agriculture in all three nations, economists have warned.\\r\\n<p>In other remarks to reporters on the presidential plane, Mr. Trump said he would consider signing a two-week extension of government funding to give lawmakers more time to negotiate a seven-bill spending package, as well as to accommodate memorial services honoring former President George Bush, who died on Friday. Mr. Trump had told lawmakers he would veto any bill that did not include $5 billion for a southern border wall, raising the prospect of a partial government shutdown.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Trump also told reporters that his second summit meeting with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, could be held in January or February, which he and his aides have suggested before.\\r\\n<br>The president\u2019s Nafta move is the first indication of how he plans to deal with the new Democratic majority. Mr. Trump seems to have opted for diplomacy at the end of a political barrel, telling reporters on Saturday that Democrats \u201cwill have a choice\u201d of whether to approve the deal as written or risk the consequences.\\r\\n<br>Even as he suggested he would make such a drastic move, he played down its potential impact, adding that he would have no problem reverting to a \u201cpre-Nafta\u201d environment. Such a scenario \u201cworks very well\u201d for the United States, he said.\\r\\n<br>Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader who is likely to be elected speaker, cast doubt on the likelihood that the deal could be passed without significant new assurances from Mexico that labor standards in the agreement will be strictly enforced.\\r\\n<p>Ms. Pelosi described the deal on Friday as a \u201cwork in progress\u201d her members could not yet support. \u201cWhat isn\u2019t in it yet is enough enforcement reassurances regarding workers, provisions that relate to workers and to the environment,\u201d she said.\\r\\n<br>A spokesman for Mrs. Pelosi did not say on Sunday if the president\u2019s move would accelerate her timetable or alter her negotiating strategy. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing but not surprising that President Trump would try to force Congress to reinstate the status quo of Nafta, instead of working constructively with Congress to improve his proposed agreement to actually protect and strengthen American workers,\u201d said the spokesman, Henry Connelly.\\r\\n<br>There is no language in Nafta\u2019s authorizing law that requires congressional approval for withdrawal from the treaty, although some of Mr. Trump\u2019s staff believe the matter is ambiguous and could end up in court.\\r\\n<br>Congress, at Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s instigation, could proactively pass legislation, with a veto-proof majority, blocking him from doing pulling out of Nafta. But most legislative leaders think that scenario is unlikely.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement, which came shortly after he agreed to hold off on new tariffs against China in face-to-face negotiations with the Chinese leader Xi Jinping, was also intended to emphasize his tough stance on trade as he softens his posture with Beijing.\\r\\n<br>The move took many of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisers by surprise: In the lead-up to the Argentina trip, most of them were said to believe that scrapping Nafta was off the table.\\r\\n<br>But Mr. Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with Democrats, telling people in his orbit that he believes they would rather turn their backs on a \u201cgreat deal\u201d than see him achieve one of his top campaign goals, according to a person who has spoken to the president in the past week.\\r\\n<p>Peter Navarro, Mr. Trump\u2019s hard-line trade adviser, had long prodded the president to formally withdraw from the old Nafta deal, and Mr. Trump has frequently threatened to do so during meetings with his staff members and foreign leaders.\\r\\n<br>Until Friday, he had been talked out of making such a move by moderate advisers including Gary D.

These super-sharp and pleasingly hefty Japanese nail clippers are a revelation. \\r\\n<p>Nov. 26-Dec. 2\\r\\n<h2>What\u2019s Up?\\r\\n<br>General Motors made a jarring announcement early in the week: The company plans to idle five North American factories, cutting around 14,000 jobs. Mary T. Barra, G.M.\u2019s chief executive, said the move would keep the company competitive in a changing auto market. But not everyone was convinced. Employees and other residents of Lordstown, Ohio, a town near one of the plants, said they felt like victims of corporate greed. In other car-trouble news: At the Tesla plant in California, African-American workers said they had experienced racial threats, demeaning assignments and more.\\r\\n<p>Starwood loyalists have yet another reason to be mad. The rewards program integration with Marriott\u2019s (the two hotel companies started a long merger process in 2016) has not been going smoothly, and on Friday, Marriott announced an enormous breach of the database of its Starwood reservation system. Information about 500 million guests \u2014\u00a0including some customers\u2019 names, addresses, dates of birth, passport numbers, email addresses and phone numbers \u2014 was lifted from the company\u2019s networks. The breach was larger than the Equifax debacle last year. \\r\\n<br>Police officers, prosecutors, tax authorities and other agents descended on Deutsche Bank headquarters in Frankfurt on Thursday, as part of an investigation into whether the bank helped clients launder money in an offshore tax haven. Management board members\u2019 offices were searched the next day, dramatically raising the stakes for the bank. Deutsche Bank said it was cooperating with the authorities. It\u2019s had a lot of practice: The raid is only the latest dose of turmoil for Deutsche, which for years has seen significant executive turnover and legal settlements running into the billions.\\r\\n<p>Dec. 3-9\\r\\n<h2>What\u2019s Next?\\r\\n<br>Tech executives must be racking up points, what with all their flights from the Bay Area to Washington. Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, is the latest. He will testify there on Wednesday and is likely to hear accusations from Republican lawmakers that his company suppresses conservative-leaning news. Separately, there are reports that the White House plans to host a discussion with influential tech executives. No word on whether Sheryl Sandberg will attend. The Times reported this past week that the Facebook exec personally ordered staff to research the finances of the billionaire George Soros, a decision that profoundly backfired.\\r\\n<br>OPEC is set to meet on Thursday. Most experts believe the oil-producing nations will more or less maintain the status quo for production, so your drive over the river and through the woods to grandmother\u2019s house should remain affordable. Mr. Trump hopes to push oil prices even lower, but analysts say it\u2019s probably in everyone\u2019s best interests if they stay near current levels. (Those prices are pretty good compared with a decade ago, when my driver\u2019s ed instructor predicted that I\u2019d be paying at least $6 per gallon when I became an adult. Fortunately, he was wrong. I take the subway anyway.)\\r\\n<p>Three intrepid space explorers, including one American, head to the International Space Station on Monday. Anne McClain, the American astronaut, will join a Russian and a Canadian on her first trip to space. It\u2019s been a banner month for NASA, which landed a probe on Mars last week. Elsewhere in the space space, Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX and Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Galactic continue to make promises for manned private-sector spaceflights. Mr. Branson said his company\u2019s first mission was imminent.\\r\\n<h2>What Else?\\r\\n<br>New Zealand barred Huawei, a Chinese tech company, from supplying hardware to Kiwi companies building the next-generation mobile data network amid rising fears that Huawei products could be used for snooping. Back in the States, the Federal Reserve raised hopes that it might be closer to ending its drive to raise interest rates, setting off a market surge last Wednesday. And financial markets in the United States will be closed this coming Wednesday to honor the memory of former President George Bush, who died late Friday at age 94.\\r\\n<h2>What Counts?\\r\\n<br>$120 million.

Shouldn\u2019t we all?\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>Even though I was heading to a highly coveted job at The New York Times in 1965, I was heartbroken to leave Minneapolis, where I had begun my journalistic career two year earlier.\\r\\n<br>Minneapolis was then, and still is, a slice of heaven for anyone who enjoys the great outdoors. According to an ambitious project of the Trust for Public Land, Minneapolis leads the nation\u2019s metropolitan areas in providing the best overall access for the most people to well-equipped and serviced public parks and recreation. Its neighbor, St. Paul, is a close second.\\r\\n<br>Not surprising, then, is the fact that Minneapolis-St. Paul is also ranked the healthiest urban region in the country. And no, their residents are not preserved by the cold! If anything, they are out there enjoying it \u2014 ice skating, cross-country skiing, sledding, cycling, running, walking, you name it.\\r\\n<br>An analysis by the trust revealed that 96 percent of Minneapolitans and 98 percent of St. Paulites live within a 10-minute walk of a park, compared with 70 percent of residents in the 100 largest cities over all. New York City, with 99 percent of residents enjoying easy access to a park, playground, trail or other open area, ranks ninth overall in terms of public outdoor access when park size and other factors are considered.\\r\\n<p>Despite its generally clement weather, Charlotte, N.C., with an average temperature of 60 degrees, 218 sunny days and only four inches of snow and 41 inches of rain a year, has the poorest overall access to public lands among the 100 major metropolitan areas studied. The analysis covered residents in 14,000 communities the Census Bureau designates as \u201curban areas,\u201d which are where approximately 85 percent of Americans now live.\\r\\n<br>Last year, in partnership with the National Recreation and Parks Association and Urban Land Institute, the trust started a noble initiative that could bring Minneapolis-type benefits to every resident in the country: access to \u201ca high-quality park within a 10-minute, or half-mile, walk,\u201d Adrian Benepe, senior vice president for the trust and former New York City parks commissioner, told me.\\r\\n<br>Thus far, more than 220 mayors, including those serving most of America\u2019s largest cities, have signed on to support the project, which has the potential to do as much or more for the nation\u2019s physical and mental health than anything Congress might pass.\\r\\n<br>\u201cParks are key to good, healthy cities,\u201d Mr. Benepe said. \u201cThe connection between parks and health is well established.\u201d A 10-minute walk can enhance physical fitness, reduce the risk of chronic disease and improve brain function, like learning and memory. The 10 minutes it takes to walk back home, not to mention the activity done in between, are a bonus.\\r\\n<br>\u201cParks are the key to good public health and to the environmental health of cities,\u201d Mr. Benepe said. Hanaa A. Hamdi, the trust\u2019s public health director, says research has shown that community green spaces can reduce violent crime; counter stress and social isolation, especially for older adults; improve concentration for children with attention deficit disorder; enhance relaxation; and promote self-esteem and resilience. \\r\\n<p>Dr. Hamdi said in an interview that 35 percent to 40 percent of health is determined by one\u2019s physical environment, including public access to green spaces, outdoor recreation and community gardens. Accordingly, the trust is collaborating with hospitals and community health workers to foster investment in open spaces and create programs that counter physical and mental illness. One project, called Walk with a Doc, enlists physicians, nurses, nutritionists and social workers to take scheduled walks with patients with Type 2 diabetes to help foster healthier lifestyles.\\r\\n<br>As an added benefit, Mr. Benepe said, \u201cParks mitigate the effects of climate change. Their trees absorb and store carbon and trap particulate matter on leaf surfaces. They absorb storm water runoff, keeping it out of sewers and countering pollution, and they reduce the impact of the urban island heat effect.\u201d\\r\\n<br>There are also untold social and community benefits linked to public park spaces. Friends of mine, Kathryn Morrissette and Michael Smith, each had a dog and met during off-leash hours in Prospect Park in Brooklyn. They married and became the proud parents of two boys, Dillon, 3, and Wyatt, 1, who now frolic in the park as well.\\r\\n<br>It\u2019s not enough for an area to have lots of parks if people can\u2019t get to them without using public or private transportation, the trust maintains. \u201cPeople have to be able to walk there,\u201d Mr. Benepe said. \u201cThey can\u2019t grow wings to fly over a highway or river.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Of the vast majority of Americans who live in cities and their suburbs, about two-thirds already have a park within a 10-minute walk. But that still leaves 110 million Americans who lack this access. Perhaps the biggest selling point for the nation\u2019s mayors may be the fact that park access increases real estate values, which provides cities with a larger tax base.\\r\\n<br>Along with Minneapolis and St. Paul, the trust\u2019s analysis suggests that the most livable urban areas in the country are Washington, D.C., Arlington, Va., San Francisco, Portland, Ore., Cincinnati, Chicago and New York.\\r\\n<br>About 99 percent of New Yorkers live within a 10-minute walk of a public recreation area primarily because \u201cthere are so many playgrounds,\u201d a tribute, Mr. Benepe said, to the controversial \u201cmaster builder\u201d Robert Moses, under whose leadership park playgrounds increased from 100 in 1934 to 658 by 1960, and now number about 1,000.\\r\\n<p>The city\u2019s schoolyards, long characterized \u201cby terrible sheets of asphalt and locked up during nonschool hours,\u201d Mr. Benepe said, are being turned into inviting playgrounds that are open to the community evenings, weekends and holidays.\\r\\n<br>Although the trust is currently focused on metropolitan areas, Mr. Benepe said he\u2019s \u201cworried about people who live in small towns, where the land is privately owned. It may be colored green on the map, but it\u2019s not necessarily accessible.\u201d\\r\\n<br>The trust\u2019s ParkScore index ranks metropolitan areas based on four factors: the percentage of residents living within a 10-minute walk to a park; the median size of local parks and percentage of city area they constitute; the dollar investment in parks per resident; and the availability of six popular park features: basketball hoops; off-leash dog parks; playgrounds; splashpads and other water-play structures; recreation and senior centers; and restrooms.\\r\\n<br>Community leaders can use the trust\u2019s ParkScore-generated maps to determine where new parks are most needed. And citizens can use the information on the trust\u2019s website, parkscore.tpl.org, to encourage elected officials to provide more equitable access to quality parks.\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"health.9.txt\",\"id\":-1715214620},{\"title\":\"Rania Youssef, Egyptian Actress Who Dressed to Impress, Could Be Jailed\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"Her lacy, revealing dress at a Cairo film festival spurred three lawyers to sue her for \u201cincitement to debauchery.\u201d A trial is scheduled for January.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>CAIRO \u2014 When an Egyptian actress strutted down the red carpet in Cairo last week, twirling and smiling in a revealing lace dress, she had hoped to turn heads in the movie world.\\r\\n<br>Instead, she now faces criminal charges that could potentially land her in prison.\\r\\n<br>Three Egyptian lawyers known for using the courts to engage in moral vigilantism filed a lawsuit against the actress, Rania Youssef, accusing her of wearing an outfit at the Cairo International Film Festival that constituted \u201cincitement to debauchery.\u201d\\r\\n<br>A trial has been scheduled for January, and Ms. Youssef, who is in her 40s, could face a possible five-year jail term if convicted.\\r\\n<p>The case is the latest in a series of high-profile prosecutions targeting celebrities in Egypt under the authoritarian rule of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. They are often brought by lawyers claiming to police public morals by regulating attire, behavior and even jokes under the guise of protecting a brittle version of Egyptian nationalism.\\r\\n<p>Such prosecutions often ultimately fail. The pop singer Sherine Abdel-Wahab, initially sentenced to six months\u2019 imprisonment for an onstage joke about the quality of water in the notoriously dirty Nile, was acquitted on appeal in May.\\r\\n<br>But sometimes the charges stick, resulting in prisons sentences for entertainers convicted of breaching public morals. The prosecutions have had a chilling effect on free speech at a time when Egypt\u2019s news media is largely under the sway of Mr. Sisi, and his government has engaged in a harsh crackdown on the gay community.\\r\\n<br>Egypt\u2019s overcrowded prisons currently include a singer who was imprisoned for making lewd gestures in a pop video, and a female human rights activist who had broadcast a profanity-laced video on Facebook about being sexually harassed in public.\\r\\n<br>Women\u2019s dress has always been a fault line in the culture wars of Egypt, where the tradition of belly dancing inspires both admiration and revulsion.\\r\\n<p>The dress that Ms. Youssef wore at the film festival \u2014 a semitransparent outfit that exposed most of her legs \u2014 led some Egyptians to support her prosecution.\\r\\n<br>\u201cShe, and whoever let her appear like this, must be put on trial,\u201d one person said on Twitter.\\r\\n<br>Others said the case revealed the mind-set of the men who had brought the charges, using a law that allows one Egyptian to file a lawsuit against another for vague crimes like immorality and \u201cinsulting\u201d the nation.\\r\\n<br>The dress has only exposed your obsession,\u201d the director Amr Salama said on Twitter.\\r\\n<br>Ms. Youssef apologized for wearing the dress and stressed that she respected Egyptian cultural and moral values. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect this reaction, and if I had known, I wouldn\u2019t have worn this dress,\u201d she said in a statement.\\r\\n<br>One of the prosecuting lawyers, Samir Sabry, claims to have filed more than 2,700 such lawsuits over 40 years, targeting actors, clerics, politicians and belly dancers. He even sued the makers of a famous puppet show, \u201cAbla Fahita,\u201d for a skit on the novel \u201cFifty Shades of Grey.\u201d The case failed.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Sabry, who supports Mr. Sisi, has also brought lawsuits against the president\u2019s political opponents, including members of the Muslim Brotherhood.\\r\\n<br>In 2013, many Egyptians supported the military takeover that brought Mr. Sisi to power out of fear that the Muslim Brotherhood, whose leader, Mohammed Morsi, was ousted from power, would restrict women\u2019s rights and social freedoms. On Sunday, some noted acerbically on Twitter that those same rights had been eroded under Mr. Sisi.\\r\\n<br>The vigilante-driven court activism of the Sisi era has also led to harsh restrictions on some minorities, last year prompting the harshest crackdown on the gay community in decades. The case against Ms. Youssef also highlights the highly variable speeds of Egyptian justice.\\r\\n<p>Charges against public figures involving morality or nationalism often move at a brisk pace \u2014 Ms. Youssef is due in court on Jan. 12 \u2014 while political prisoners or detained journalists languish in jail for years, awaiting trial in cases that proceed at a crawl.\\r\\n<br>Such cases also undermine efforts to revive Egypt\u2019s ailing economy by promoting tourism and the country\u2019s ancient heritage. The furor over Ms. Youssef overshadowed an announcement about the discovery of eight startlingly well-preserved mummies in a tomb near the pyramids of Giza.\\r\\n<br>It also overshadowed the Cairo film festival, which was celebrating its 40th year and awarded its Golden Pyramid prize to the film \u201cA Twelve-Year Night.\u201d\\r\\n<br>As for Ms. Youssef, she will most likely hope that her coming court case does not become an example of life imitating art.\\r\\n<br>This year, she finished a movie in which she plays a famous artist who is sent to prison, and struggles to rebuild her life after her release.\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"world.7.txt\",\"id\":1992551465},{\"title\":\"Mediator: News Networks Fall Short on Climate Story as Dolphins Die on the Beach\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"A crusader films the red-tide carnage in Florida.

She joined the debate on Facebook, making the case that the combined effects of sugar plantations, fertilizer runoff and warming seas were sustaining the microscopic Karenia brevis algae species and making it more lethal.\\r\\n<br>Many scientists agree with that assessment, arguing that human-based nutrients and climate change are at least exacerbating the red tide and other algae blooms.\\r\\n<p>But Florida is run by a governor, Rick Scott, whose environmental officials had discouraged the use of the phrase \u201cclimate change.\u201d And this part of the state is Trump country, not to mention a vacation enclave for conservative media stars like Sean Hannity and Neal Boortz, who doubt the scientific consensus on the human contributions to climate change.\\r\\n<p>On community Facebook pages, neighbors accused Ms. Gill and others of getting worked up over nothing. The algae bloom was nature running its course, they said.\\r\\n<br>Irked by the debate and concerned that the news media wasn\u2019t doing enough to cover what she was seeing on the beach, Ms. Gill, whose father was a producer for CBS News, started shooting videos with her iPhone during her morning walks.\\r\\n<br>\u201cI started going around and filming more and more and more and more,\u201d she told me as we stood on the Naples pier.\\r\\n<br>On Nov. 26, one of her videos went so viral that it drew the notice of The Naples Daily News and local news stations.\\r\\n<br>In the video, Ms. Gill zoomed in on a six-foot-long, stiff, glistening dolphin carcass, its mouth frozen into a toothy smile. The creature was one of more than 20 dead bottlenose dolphins that had washed up on local beaches in recent days.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThis is the seventh one in 24 hours,\u201d Ms. Gill said through tears in the video. \u201cWhen is this going to stop?\u201d\\r\\n<p>At roughly the same time, in Washington, President Trump told reporters outside the White House that he had doubts about the climate change report his administration had released the day after Thanksgiving.\\r\\n<br>The report warned that unmitigated global warming would take a huge economic toll on the country while causing crop failures, more extreme fires, stronger storms and, potentially, more severe algae blooms.\\r\\n<br>\u201cYeah,\u201d Mr. Trump said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d\\r\\n<br>The administration had made the report public without any effort to soften its conclusions, as the administration of George W. Bush had done with similar reports. Under President Trump, it seemed no longer necessary to spin the particulars, Coral Davenport reported for The New York Times. The administration had hit upon a new tactic that drew from lessons that Mr. Trump had learned on the campaign trail: All you have to do these days to combat facts is to declare them false. Disdain is stronger than spin.\\r\\n<p>As Steven J. Milloy, a skeptic of human-caused climate change and a member of the Trump transition team, said, there had been no need \u201cto stop the deep state\u201d from releasing the report when \u201cthis is made-up hysteria, anyway.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Thankfully, cable news came to the rescue by making sure that those who commented on air about a report produced by scientists across 13 federal agencies were trained experts.\\r\\n<br>No, wait. That\u2019s not what happened.\\r\\n<br>On CNN, the former senator Rick Santorum disputed the findings with a canard: \u201cA lot of these scientists are driven by the money that they receive,\u201d he said. The network later came under fire when \u201cAC360\u201d had Mr. Santorum on again but canceled a planned interview with an author of the government report, the atmospheric scientist Katharine Hayhoe of Texas Tech University.\\r\\n<p>On NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Danielle Pletka of the American Enterprise Institute attacked the climate change report by falsely stating, \u201cWe need to also recognize that we just had two of the coldest years, the biggest drop in global temperatures, that we\u2019ve had since the 1980s,\u201d although 2016 and 2017 were among the warmest years on record.\\r\\n<br>My depressing Florida journey took me from the deadly beach in Naples to the other side of the state, where I met with Benjamin Kirtman, the director of the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies at the University of Miami.\\r\\n<br>He suggested that television news bookers change their approach if they want to accurately reflect the debate.\\r\\n<br>Citing the NASA finding that 97 percent of actively published climate scientists agree that warming trends are \u201cextremely likely due to human activities,\u201d Professor Kirtman said cable news shows should book three skeptics for every 97 nonskeptics.\\r\\n<br>\u201cYou have 97 percent of climate scientists who understand the science and know what the reality is, and then you find a podiatrist from Yahupitz who\u2019s going to tell you not to worry,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a false equivalence.\u201d\\r\\n<br>We were in his office on Virginia Key, in Miami. If human causes of climate change go unmitigated, he said, the Biscayne Bay will overcome the road here at high tide half the days of the year by 2100. Last year Miamians voted to spend some $200 million on sea walls and pumps and drains to mitigate the effects of the rising sea.\\r\\n<p>Yet despite that literal, concrete evidence, Professor Kirtman told me that a third of those he talks to about the data behind human-influenced climate change just don\u2019t buy it. So he has stopped trying to persuade that part of the population.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThey\u2019re going to have to find out for themselves,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen they can\u2019t sell their house.\u201d\\r\\n<br>I hadn\u2019t heard that kind of pessimism from Mr. Kirtman when I met him four years ago while covering the governor\u2019s race. I wondered whether Facebook hadn\u2019t contributed to hardening positions, with increasing talk of the \u201cdeep state\u201d providing denialists with a fresh line of attack.\\r\\n<br>That sort of conspiracy-mongering was part of why Ms. Gill said she had decided to post videos of the red tide carnage in Naples.\\r\\n<br>She knew that in the \u201cfake news\u201d era doubters could accuse her of doctoring evidence, so she came up with a solution: \u201cI decided to do it on Facebook Live, so people couldn\u2019t be like, \u2018You made that up,\u2019\u201d she told me.\\r\\n<br>Still, not everyone was convinced by her posts, which have at times been met by ridicule, vitriol and ugly name-calling.\\r\\n<br>On the other hand, as the arrival of television news crews suggested, she seemed to be breaking through.\\r\\n<br>By the end of my time with Ms. Gill, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared that 42 dolphins had died in the previous 10 days. And a new emergency was breaking out. Sea birds \u2014 including sandwich terns and common terns \u2014 were dropping out of the sky, dying by the hundreds.\\r\\n<p>Veterinarians at the von Arx Wildlife Hospital of the Conservancy of Southwest Florida were deluged. The director, Joanne Fitzgerald, told me they weren\u2019t ready to blame red tide. Working in the reality business, they were awaiting lab results. But she added that she had never seen anything like it in 25 years.\\r\\n<br>\u201cI don\u2019t understand the denial when there is proof of something like this affecting the animals,\u201d Ms. Fitzgerald said. \u201cI mean, you can\u2019t keep denying it.\u201d\\r\\n<br>After a pause, she added, \u201cI mean, obviously, you can.

We would play for hours.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Now, as the chief executive of Tastemakers, a toy company, he is recreating that experience for a new generation. The business has collected licenses for his favorite games and others, like Street Fighter II, and is reproducing them in its Arcade1Up arcade-style cabinets.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThis was a passion project,\u201d Mr. Bachrach said, \u201cthat turned into a significant business for us.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Tastemakers is not alone in trying to capitalize on the nostalgia for older video games. Nintendo helped popularize the retro gaming trend with the 2016 release of the NES Classic, a scaled-down and inexpensive version of its original console and 30 vintage games. After that, other rivals, including Sony, started mining their vaults to resurface games and hardware, while smaller companies began remastering past titles. Some struggling game brands, like Atari, are getting a boost from continued interest in older games.\\r\\n<p>Retailers are getting into the mix as well, with companies like Amazon and Target scrambling to provide space exclusively for classic video games and related merchandise. Even the electric-car maker Tesla included some Atari games in the latest software update for its vehicles.\\r\\n<br>\u201cIn the past, we thought games were more disposable entertainment,\u201d said Mat Piscatella, a video game industry analyst for NPD, a market research company. \u201cThere is a lot of intrinsic value that old games can provide.\u201d\\r\\n<br>One in five new consoles sold in the United States this year has been a retro plug-and-play device, Mr. Piscatella said, contributing to the overall growth in the video game industry. Sales of hardware, software and accessories in the United States reached $14.6 billion in 2017, an 11 percent increase over 2016, according to NPD.\\r\\n<p>\u201cEverything in gaming has gotten so complicated and tech heavy,\u201d Mr. Piscatella said. \u201cHere\u2019s this $80 device that you can plug into a TV and go.\u201d\\r\\n<p>Nintendo\u2019s NES Classic was an immediate sellout, prompting the company to follow up with the Super NES Classic, one of the top-selling consoles in the 2017 holiday shopping season, according to NPD. Nintendo announced on Wednesday that it had sold more than two million NES Classic consoles and more than 2.5 million Super NES Classic consoles in the United States since they were introduced.\\r\\n<br>For players looking to play the games on a modern device, Nintendo offered 20 classic games to subscribers of its Nintendo Switch Online network, a premium service that went live in September, and has plans to add more.\\r\\n<br>\u201cPeople remember the colors and shape of the console and the feel of the controllers from their childhood, and they have a visceral reaction when they first fire up their favorite NES or Super NES games,\u201d said Reginald Fils-Aim\u00e9, president and chief operating officer of Nintendo of America.\\r\\n<br>Sony will follow suit on Monday with the PlayStation Classic, a plug-and-play unit loaded with 20 games for $100. The company has reintroduced older titles over its game network in the past, but this will be an opportunity to relive playing those games on the first PlayStation console, said Eric Lempel, senior vice president of global marketing at PlayStation.\\r\\n<br>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like watching a classic movie versus a remake or a colorized version,\u201d Mr. Lempel said. \u201cThis is the way you remember those games.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Smaller companies are having success licensing games and repackaging them with new hardware. AtGames, a manufacturer in Taiwan, has sold titles from developers like Activision, Atari and Bandai Namco for more than a decade through its Flashback series, which packages games on replicas of the once popular Atari 2600 and Sega Genesis consoles.\\r\\n<p>AtGames\u2019 latest offering, Blast, is a pared-down version with fewer games, a small controller and a dongle that plugs into an HDMI port on a TV. This new product allows the company to move into a lower price point, said PK Hsiung, the company\u2019s chief executive. Nintendo and PlayStation aim for typical technology retailers, he said, but 80 percent of AtGames\u2019 sales come from retailers like CVS, Kroger, Walgreens and Bed Bath & Beyond.\\r\\n<p>\u201cThey are not competing with us,\u201d Mr. Hsiung said of his bigger rivals. \u201cThey are helping us by making retro games mainstream.\u201d\\r\\n<br>The influx of games and new consoles is starting to make analysts like Mr. Piscatella of NPD wonder how much longer the sales growth can last. Nintendo dominates sales, but it has not announced plans to release other classic consoles. Other publishers may face difficulties, Mr. Piscatella added, like finding the right fit for their games or securing licenses.\\r\\n<br>Rather than license their games to other companies, some video game publishers are releasing them on their own. After finding a hit with a retro Crash Bandicoot package last year, Activision remastered a trilogy of games featuring Spyro the Dragon.\\r\\n<br>\u201cIt\u2019s probably better to say we remade these games,\u201d said Steve Young, executive vice president and chief revenue officer at Activision. Because of advances in the processing power of consoles, studios are able to rebuild games from the ground up with high-definition graphics, he said.\\r\\n<br>Even the music was updated. The publisher invited Stewart Copeland, the former drummer for the Police and the composer of the original Spyro series\u2019 soundtrack, to create a new main theme for the remastered version.\\r\\n<br>Other publishers are reaching deals with accessory makers like Retro-Bit. The company\u2019s Super Retro-Cade console features more than 90 titles from publishers like Capcom, Data East, Irem and Technos.\\r\\n<p>\u201cThis console brings a lot of games released out of Japan that were never released in the U.S.,\u201d said Richard Igros, the marketing manager for Innex, the distributor of Retro-Bit products. The company also repackages hard-to-find classic games on cartridges made for older consoles.\\r\\n<br>One of their biggest sellers, for instance, is a collection that includes an obscure title, Magic Drop. \u201cIt\u2019s not a well-known game,\u201d Mr. Igros admits, \u201cbut it has a cult following.\u201d\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"business.13.txt\",\"id\":-688677695},{\"title\":\"That Virus Alert on Your Computer?

They pop up on your computer screen with ominous warnings like, \u201cYour computer has been infected with a virus. Call our toll-free number immediately for help.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Often they look like alerts from Microsoft, Apple or Symantec. Sometimes the warning comes in a phone call.\\r\\n<br>Most people ignore these entreaties, which are invariably scams. But one in five recipients actually talks to the fake tech-support centers, and 6 percent ultimately pay the operators to \u201cfix\u201d the nonexistent problem, according to recent consumer surveys by Microsoft.\\r\\n<br>Law enforcement authorities, working with Microsoft, have now traced many of these boiler rooms to New Delhi, India\u2019s capital and a hub of the global call-center industry. On Tuesday and Wednesday, police from two Delhi suburbs raided 16 fake tech-support centers and arrested about three dozen people. Last month, the Delhi authorities arrested 24 people in similar raids on 10 call centers.\\r\\n<p>In Gautam Budh Nagar, one of the suburbs, 50 police officers swept into eight centers on Tuesday night. Ajay Pal Sharma, the senior superintendent of police there, said the scammers had extracted money from thousands of victims, most of whom were American or Canadian.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThe modus operandi was to send a pop-up on people\u2019s systems using a fake Microsoft logo,\u201d Mr. Sharma said. After the victims contacted the call center, the operator, pretending to be a Microsoft employee, would tell them that their system had been hacked or attacked by a virus. The victims would then be offered a package of services ranging from $99 to $1,000 to fix the problem, he said.\\r\\n<br>Such scams are widespread, said Courtney Gregoire, an assistant general counsel in Microsoft\u2019s digital crimes unit.\\r\\n<br>Microsoft, whose Windows software runs most personal computers, gets 11,000 or so complaints about the scams every month, she said, and its internet monitors spot about 150,000 pop-up ads for the services every day. The company\u2019s own tech-support forums, where people can publicly post items, also see a steady stream of posts offering fake tech-support services.\\r\\n<br>Although American authorities have busted such scams in places like Florida and Ohio, the backbone of the illicit industry is in India \u2014 in large part because of the country\u2019s experience running so many of the world\u2019s call centers. India\u2019s outsourcing industry, which includes call centers, generates about $28 billion in annual revenue and employs about 1.2 million people.\\r\\n<p>\u201cThe success of the legitimate industry has made it easier for the illegitimate industry there,\u201d Ms. Gregoire said. As in any con, experience helps. \u201cYou have to convince them they have a problem,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to have the touch.\u201d\\r\\n<br>For tech companies, combating the impersonators is complicated by the fact that many legitimate tech-support operations, including some of Microsoft\u2019s, operate from India.\\r\\n<br>The scam is quite lucrative. Researchers at Stony Brook University, who published a detailed study of fake tech-support services last year, estimated that a single pop-up campaign spread over 142 web domains brought in nearly $10 million in just two months.\\r\\n<br>Najmeh Miramirkhani, lead author of the research paper, said the network of entities involved in the scams was complex, with some making their own calls and others running the sites but outsourcing the calls to India. Many of the scammers also share data with one another.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThis is an organized crime,\u201d she said.\\r\\n<br>Microsoft said it was working with other tech industry leaders such as Apple and Google, as well as law enforcement, to fight the scourge, which is migrating beyond the English-speaking world to target other users in their local languages. In the 16 countries surveyed by Microsoft, people in India and China were the most likely to pay the con artists.\\r\\n<br>The problem extends beyond fake tech support, too. In July, the Justice Department said 24 people in eight states had been convicted for their roles in a scheme to use Indian call-center agents to impersonate tax collectors at the Internal Revenue Service. The thieves duped more than 15,000 people out of hundreds of millions of dollars. Thirty-two contractors in India were also indicted.\\r\\n<p>Mr. Sharma said that in a similar con broken up by his department, call-center agents had impersonated Canadian tax authorities.\\r\\n<br>Like the I.R.S., Microsoft and other legitimate technology companies do not call their users out of the blue. Nor do they send security alerts to the screen telling customers to call them.\\r\\n<br>Ms. Miramirkhani had some simple advice to avoid being conned: Don\u2019t pick up the phone.\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"technology.15.txt\",\"id\":-592673889},{\"title\":\"Virgos Are Queen of Teen Internet\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"Insights from Tumblr and others suggest that people really are obsessed with astrology (again) \u2014 and not just the memes.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>There\u2019s evidence that, in 2018, people online started to take astrology more seriously.\\r\\n<br>You may have had a hunch that this was a thing, but the shift was evident on Tumblr, historically the source of many of the best astrology jokes and memes, like this post assessing the sun signs of a group of big chef dolls.\\r\\n<br>These days, the astrology humor is less of a presence on the platform.

Virgo\\r\\n<br>Everyone on Tumblr stans a Virgo \u2014 possibly because many people on Tumblr were born between late August and late September. (September is the busiest month for birthdays in the past two decades.)\\r\\n<br>Virgos are \u201calso people who are very sensitive and emotional, which kind of aligns with Tumblr,\u201d Ms. Brennan said. \u201cThey\u2019re people who are extremely connected online and people who might want to use social media because they\u2019re a little more reserved in everyday life.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Ms. Guler was more blunt. (She\u2019s a Scorpio.) \u201cVirgos are kind of a nerdy sign, so it makes sense that they\u2019re still on Tumblr,\u201d she said.\\r\\n<h2>2. Leo\\r\\n<br>Ms. Brennan had an explanation for the runners-up, too, like Leos, which ranked second.\\r\\n<br>\u201cLeos are very socially active, which translates immediately to social media,\u201d she said. \u201cThey love connection, they often communicate through humor. And they wear their heart on their sleeves.\u201d\\r\\n<br>She paused, and added, \u201cThey also like to talk about themselves.\u201d\\r\\n<br>A lot of people are born in late July and August, too, so it may be that Leos and Virgos are simply overrepresented in the numbers.\\r\\n<h2>3. Aries\\r\\n<br>But that\u2019s not true of Aries, the first sign in the zodiac, which showed up third on Tumblr\u2019s list. Why were they overrepresented on Tumblr?\\r\\n<p>\u201cAries are always on their phone,\u201d Ms. Brennan said.\\r\\n<h2>4. Scorpio\\r\\n<br>It may be that the Tumblr rankings largely correspond to people researching their own signs. But Scorpios are the sign that is perhaps of most interest to people who are not Scorpios. Ms. Brennan said that Scorpio blogs abound on Tumblr.\\r\\n<br>\u201cI think there\u2019s kind of a mystery around the Scorpio that people are really drawn to,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t have the data to back it \u2026 it\u2019s kind of my theory that a lot of people are just trying to figure out Scorpios.\u201d\\r\\n<br>That said, Scorpios are basically guaranteed to remind you when their season comes around, whether verbally or with a link to an object they desire. Mejuri, a Canadian jewelry company that targets young people, said that its Scorpio necklace was the most popular of its 12 Zodiac necklaces. (The Gemini necklace was the runner-up.) \\r\\n<br>And then, there\u2019s \u2026\\r\\n<h2>12. Sagittarius\\r\\n<br>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me that Sagittarius is toward the bottom,\u201d Ms. Guler said. \u201cI feel like part of Sagittarius\u2019s nature is that they don\u2019t seem like astrology nerds.

Here are some of Dr. Pidich\u2019s tips, all of which she keeps top of mind for her own travels.\\r\\n<h2>Carry a food allergy card in multiple languages\\r\\n<br>Have a card handy that lists your food allergies in the language or languages spoken at your destination. You can create your own cards with simple notecards or sturdy paper, or order them from Allergy Translation, which charges $8 to create one card through its app or website. (You can print as many copies of each card as you want once you place an order.)\\r\\n<p>Make sure that your cards clearly list which foods you can\u2019t eat, rather than just stating what you\u2019re allergic to. For example, my allergy cards don\u2019t just say that I\u2019m allergic to gluten and dairy, they say that wheat and wheat-based products such as soy and anything containing milk, including yogurt, are off-limits.\\r\\n<br>Similarly, Dr. Pidich\u2019s cards say that she can\u2019t eat clams, shrimp and lobster. She learned the hard way how important it is to be super specific on her cards: her allergy card when she traveled to Tulum, Mexico a few years ago simply said in Spanish that she was allergic to shellfish, but she was served a dish with shrimp and ended up with hives all over her body.\\r\\n<h2>Order with an abundance of caution\\r\\n<br>This may sound obvious, but in an ideal scenario, you always travel with food allergy cards and the people serving you understand what you\u2019re not allowed to eat.\\r\\n<br>But say you forget your cards, or think \u201coh, this looks fine\u201d because your trigger foods aren\u2019t on the ingredient list. Dr. Pidich said that you still shouldn\u2019t assume that what you\u2019re eating is safe. Certain foods and drinks, in particular, including sauces, salad dressings, soups and cocktails hide common allergens such as wheat, nuts, dairy and shellfish.\\r\\n<br>Restaurant cooks often use flour to thicken sauces, for example, while soups can have shellfish broth, and salad dressings are blended with soy sauce or nut oils. Ask any vegetarian or vegan what it\u2019s like to be surprised when their salad dressing has cheese in it or the vegetable soup has been prepared with chicken broth, and you\u2019ll understand what it\u2019s like. In short, even if you think you\u2019re being cautious, be extra cautious.\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<h2>Travel with a food stash\\r\\n<br>There\u2019s nothing worse than going hungry on your trip because you can\u2019t find enough safe food to eat. Dr. Pidich highly recommended packing plenty of snacks and a few meal replacement options on your trip, if you can.\\r\\n<br>Consider nonperishable snacks that are carry-on safe, like powdered protein shakes (go for pea protein powder if you can because it\u2019s easy to digest and the least allergenic, compared with other, usually whey-based, powdered proteins), low-sodium jerky, low-sodium powdered soups that can be rehydrated with hot water, roasted chickpeas, nuts (as long as you\u2019re not allergic to nuts!), and dried fruits or crunchy vegetables.\\r\\n<h2>Consider a hotel room or a Airbnb with a kitchen\\r\\n<br>Having access to a kitchen means you can prepare some meals for yourself. This also cuts down on the stress of not being able to find allergy-safe food to eat.\\r\\n<br>Take your allergy card with you when you go food shopping so that the people working at the supermarket or farmers\u2019 market can you steer you clear of anything you\u2019re allergic to, and make sure to follow our general tips to stay healthy while traveling.\\r\\n<h2>Don\u2019t forget your allergy medicine (but carry it legally)\\r\\n<br>Even if your food allergy isn\u2019t severe, you shouldn\u2019t leave home without your allergy medicine. Sure, you\u2019ll want it just in case you have an uncomfortable reaction like hives or itching, but you shouldn\u2019t assume you can buy what you need locally, depending on where you go.\\r\\n<br>In most common destinations you can, but Dr. Pidich said that it\u2019s better to pack some in your carry-on that you already know and have used. If you have a travel companion, have them carry an extra dose or two of the medicine in case you lose yours. The same goes for an Epi-Pen, if you use one. Finally, make sure you familiarize yourself with your destination\u2019s rules and regulations about prescription (and nonprescription) medication, so you\u2019ll make it through customs with your medicine.\\r\\n<p>\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"health.8.txt\",\"id\":659434447},{\"title\":\"Far-Right Vox Party Erodes Socialists\u2019 Control in Spain\u2019s Largest Region\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"Voting results in Andalusia were a blow to the country\u2019s Socialist prime minister, who could be forced into a snap general election next year.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>MADRID \u2014 Spain\u2019s governing Socialist party suffered an unexpected election setback on Sunday as right-wing parties won enough votes to oust the Socialists from power in the nation\u2019s largest region for the first time since the country returned to democracy.\\r\\n<br>The result in Andalusia was a blow to Pedro S\u00e1nchez, Spain\u2019s Socialist prime minister, who has been in office since June and could now be forced into a snap general election next year.\\r\\n<br>The Socialists won just 33 of the 109 seats in the regional parliament, according to provisional results released late Sunday, with 94 percent of the votes counted. It was the party\u2019s worst result in Andalusia since 1982, when the region held its first election after Spain adopted a new Constitution.\\r\\n<br>The biggest change for Spain\u2019s political landscape on Sunday was the emergence of Vox, a far-right party that had never previously made any significant election inroads. The party won 12 seats, according to the provisional results.\\r\\n<p>That could make Vox a kingmaker in the formation of a right-wing coalition government in the region. The bloc would comprise the Popular Party, which secured 26 seats, and the Ciudadanos party, which won 21.\\r\\n<br>The Socialist leader in Andalusia, Susana D\u00edaz, on Sunday night urged the right-leaning parties not to allow Spain to become the latest European country in which a far-right party takes a front-line role in politics.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThere\u2019s a clear regress of the left in Andalusia, but the most worrying change is the entrance of a far-right party,\u201d she said.\\r\\n<br>One of the first to congratulate Vox on its result in Andalusia was Marine Le Pen, the leader of France\u2019s far right, who took to Twitter to praise \u201ca very significant result for a young and dynamic movement.\u201d\\r\\n<p>Polls had predicted that Ms. D\u00edaz and her Socialist party would win enough seats to remain in office, even if she was expected to fall short of a majority.\\r\\n<p>The party\u2019s surprising setback in Andalusia also lowers the odds that Mr. S\u00e1nchez will be able to stay in office in Madrid, where his grip on power was already tenuous.

Now it\u2019s a contender for the title of the world\u2019s most valuable company.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>Just a few years ago, Microsoft was seen as a lumbering has-been of the technology world.\\r\\n<br>It was big and still quite profitable, but the company had lost its luster, failing or trailing in the markets of the future like mobile, search, online advertising and cloud computing. Its stock price languished, inching up 3 percent in the decade through the end of 2012.\\r\\n<br>It\u2019s a very different story today. Microsoft is running neck and neck with Apple for the title of the world\u2019s most valuable company, both worth about $850 billion, thanks to a stock price that has climbed 30 percent over the last 12 months. At the end of trading Friday, Microsoft was just ahead of its longtime rival.\\r\\n<br>So what happened?\\r\\n<h2>The company built on its strengths\\r\\n<br>There is a short-term explanation for Microsoft\u2019s market rise, and there is a longer-term one.\\r\\n<br>The near-term, stock-trading answer is that Microsoft has held up better than others during the recent sell-off of tech company shares. Apple investors are worried about a slowdown in iPhone sales. Facebook and Google face persistent attacks on their role in distributing false news and conspiracy theories, and investor concerns that their privacy policies could scare off users and advertisers.\\r\\n<p>But the more enduring and important answer is that Microsoft has become a case study of how a once-dominant company can build on its strengths and avoid being a prisoner of its past. It has fully embraced cloud computing, abandoned an errant foray into smartphones and returned to its roots as mainly a supplier of technology to business customers.\\r\\n<br>That strategy was outlined by Satya Nadella shortly after he became chief executive in 2014. Since then, Microsoft\u2019s stock price has nearly tripled.\\r\\n<h2>It bet big on the cloud and won \u2026\\r\\n<p>Microsoft\u2019s path to cloud computing \u2014 processing, storage and software delivered as a service over the internet from remote data centers \u2014 was lengthy and sometimes halting.\\r\\n<br>Its forerunners to cloud computing go back to the 1990s, with Microsoft\u2019s MSN online service and later its Bing search engine. In 2010, four years after Amazon entered the cloud market, Microsoft introduced its cloud service. But it did not have an offering comparable to Amazon\u2019s until 2013, analysts say.\\r\\n<p>Even then, Microsoft\u2019s cloud service was a side business. The corporate center of gravity remained its Windows operating system, the linchpin of the company\u2019s wealth and power during the personal computer era. That changed after Mr. Nadella replaced Steven A. Ballmer, who had been chief executive for 14 years.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Nadella made the cloud service a top priority, and the company is now a strong No. 2 to Amazon. Microsoft has nearly doubled its share of that market to 13 percent since the end of 2015, according to the Synergy Research Group. Amazon\u2019s share has held steady at 33 percent over that span.\\r\\n<br>Microsoft has also retooled its popular Office apps like Word, Excel and PowerPoint in a cloud version, Office 365. That offering caters to people who prefer to use software as an internet service and gives Microsoft a competitive entry against online app suppliers like Google.\\r\\n<br>The financial payoff from the shift came gradually at first, but is accelerating. In the year that ended in June, Microsoft\u2019s revenue rose 15 percent, to $110 billion, and operating profit increased 13 percent, to $35 billion.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThe essence of what Satya Nadella did was the dramatic shift to the cloud,\u201d said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \u201cHe put Microsoft back into a high-growth business.\u201d\\r\\n<br>It is the perception that Microsoft is on a high-growth track that has fueled its rising share price.\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<h2>\u2026 while walking away from losing bets\\r\\n<p>When Microsoft acquired Nokia\u2019s mobile phone business in 2013, Mr. Ballmer hailed the move as a \u201cbold step into the future.\u201d Two years later, Mr. Nadella walked away from that future, taking a $7.6 billion charge, nearly the entire value of the purchase, and shedding 7,800 workers.\\r\\n<br>Microsoft would not try to compete with the smartphone technology leaders, Apple, Google and Samsung. Instead, Microsoft focused on its developing apps and other software for business customers.\\r\\n<br>Microsoft does have a successful consumer franchise in its Xbox video game business. But it is a separate unit, and though it generates revenue of $10 billion, that is still less than 10 percent of the company\u2019s overall sales.\\r\\n<br>Microsoft products, in the main, are about utility \u2014 productivity tools, whether people use them at work or at home. And its Azure cloud technology is a service for businesses and a platform for software developers to build applications, a kind of cloud operating system.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Nadella\u2019s big acquisitions have been intended to add to its offerings for business users and developers. In 2016, Microsoft bought LinkedIn, the social network for professionals, for $26.2 billion.\\r\\n<br>\u201cIt\u2019s really the coming together of the professional cloud and the professional network,\u201d Mr. Nadella explained at the time.\\r\\n<br>This year, Microsoft paid $7.5 billion for GitHub, an open software platform used by 28 million programmers.\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<h2>It has opened up its technology and culture\\r\\n<br>Under Mr. Nadella, Microsoft has loosened up. Windows would no longer be its center of gravity \u2014 or its anchor. Microsoft apps would run not only on Apple\u2019s Macintosh software but on other operating systems as well. Open source and free software, once anathema to Microsoft, was embraced as a vital tool of modern software development.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Nadella preached an outward-looking mind-set. \u201cWe need to be insatiable in our desire to learn from the outside and bring that learning into Microsoft,\u201d he wrote in his book \u201cHit Refresh,\u201d published last year.\\r\\n<br>The company\u2019s financial performance \u2014 and its stock price \u2014 suggest that the Nadella formula is working.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThe old, Windows-centric view of the world stifled innovation,\u201d said Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management. \u201cThe company has changed culturally.

By the end of that year, 82,362 cases of AIDS had been reported in the United States, and more than 61,000 people had died nationwide. In the 30 years since, the disease has killed an estimated 35.4 million people in all, including more than 700,000 in the United States. Today, there are still some 36.9 million people living with H.I.V. and AIDS around the world. The war is far from over in the United States. If current trends continue, half of all black gay and bisexual men will be living with HIV during their lifetimes. The epidemic is hitting hardest in the South, the region of our country with the fewest resources to combat it.\\r\\n<br>James Estrin, the co-editor of The New York Times\u2019s Lens blog and a senior staff photographer, was a young freelancer when he began covering the AIDS crisis for the paper. \u201cBeing a photographer, what you hold on to is the hope that your image had an effect or changed things,\u201d he said recently. \u201cThat\u2019s what you want, but rarely can you measure that effect. What you can know is that if your images were published in The New York Times, people won\u2019t be able to say they didn\u2019t know. That\u2019s good and that\u2019s enough.\u201d \\r\\n<br>We asked three Times photographers and one reporter who covered the AIDS crisis as the epidemic escalated to reflect on how they navigated what was then an unknown and terrifying world.\\r\\n<p>\u201cThe humiliation that was connected to the disease was so horrible to me. My cousin\u2019s boyfriend died, and it was impossible to find anyone that would handle his body. There was only one place in all of New York City that would actually take a person who died of AIDS. It was Redden\u2019s on 14th Street. It\u2019s still there. Many years later, his nephew came to New York, and we went there, and we thanked them.\\r\\n<br>The people with AIDS had very little time left and most were filled with fear. Fear of the disease. Fear of coming out. When someone would actually let me take their picture, it was an act of enormous generosity, and I always felt very grateful. I hope they could feel that, because being a photographer is so secondary to being the kind of person that subjects can trust.\u201d\\r\\n<p>\u201cEarly on, we were all learning how to cover AIDS, and the photographers were unbelievably disadvantaged. I could piece together a story of a certain child by doing 15 interviews: doctors, nurses, social workers. But the photographer could never piece together a picture. Either you got the image or you didn\u2019t. If you look back, you can see the number of stories that were illustrated with pictures of health care professionals or objects like the H.I.V. testing forms.\u201d \\r\\n<p>\u201cI was one of the few photographers on the staff that was using strobes and off-camera lighting. You know, portrait studio-type lighting, on location. So for me, the important thing was, no matter how tragic this was, the fact that this person was willing to talk to us and share her story, and allow herself to be photographed, I wanted to make sure it was a beautiful photograph. Why would I try to make this tragedy look even more tragic? Again, it was the whole notion of treating people that were going through this with a great deal of respect. And to do that photographically, as well as in person.\u201d \\r\\n<p>\u201cWhile it was the same disease, the experience of reporting it \u2014 and I assume photographing it \u2014 was completely different when it was gay men and when it became essentially people who\u2019d gotten it from a needle. The gay men knew exactly what was going on, and they could talk articulately about the experience they were having. They knew all about the drugs, they became their own best advocates, and for a very long time, gay men were the only people who really knew anything. If you go back and read the stories that are about them, they are the ones telling you the story. The stories that are about drug addicts or children, somebody else is always telling you the story.\u201d\\r\\n<p>\u201cThe Act Up protests were extraordinary. Which isn\u2019t surprising. So many people involved in Act Up were involved in theater or the arts. The types of protests they did were completely different. It had dramatic structure. It was fascinating to photograph. They were, by far, the best protests. They\u2019d have these \u2018die-ins.\u2019 They were really smart and well put together.\u201d\\r\\n<p>\u201cShooting in Africa was very different. It was much harder. There was enormous stigma connected with the disease, and it felt bad to just take pictures of someone who was dying and go away. It felt so cold. Luckily, I had a Polaroid camera with me, and that turned out to be a wonderful icebreaker. Being able to give a person who might have never seen a picture of themselves a photo they could keep made me happy and often made my job a little easier.\\\"\\r\\n<p>\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"health.12.txt\",\"id\":1866762063},{\"title\":\"Cambridge Analytica Used Fashion Tastes to Identify Right-Wing Voters\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"Christopher Wylie, who helped found the voter-profiling firm, said that clothing preferences had been key to helping \u201cSteve Bannon build his insurgency.\u201d\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>You\u2019ve heard of profiling criminals, but welcome to fashion profiling \u2014 the practice of classifying and targeting individuals based on their clothing brand preferences. Fashion profiling played a bigger role in the 2016 American presidential election than anyone realized, according to new information from Christopher Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica whistle-blower. \\r\\n<br>Today at a conference in Britain organized by the fashion industry website The Business of Fashion, Mr. Wylie explained that clothing preferences were a key metric for Cambridge Analytica, whose business was constructing and selling voter profiles drawn from Facebook data.\\r\\n<br>\u201cFashion data was used to build AI models to help Steve Bannon build his insurgency and build the alt-right,\u201d he said.\\r\\n<br>Preferences in clothing and music are the leading indicators of political leaning, he said. The narratives of the great American brands, which play on the myths of the West and the (mostly male) frontier are also the narratives of the Republican right. Those who choose to spend on the former are susceptible to the latter. He mentioned Wrangler and L.L. Bean in particular as brands that Cambridge Analytica aligned with conservative traits. (Kenzo, by contrast, which is designed by Humberto Leon and Carol Lim, the avant-garde duo behind the retail store Opening Ceremony, appealed to liberals, he suggested.)\\r\\n<p>\u201cFashion brands are really useful in producing algorithms to find out how people think and how they feel,\u201d Mr. Wylie said.\\r\\n<p>Neither Wrangler nor L.L. Bean responded to requests for comment.\\r\\n<br>David Stillwell, the deputy director of The Psychometrics Center at Cambridge University, where a psychologist, Aleksandr Kogan, witnessed work that would inform Cambridge Analytica's approach, compared this form of fashion analysis to a study showing that car ownership can correlate with political voting preferences in certain regions. (Places where hybrids line the streets reliably vote Democrat; the opposite is true where pickup trucks are concerned.)\\r\\n<br>\u201cEssentially the reasoning is the same,\u201d he said. \u201cDifferent people choose different clothes and it correlates with their politics.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Mr. Wylie\u2019s revelations suggest a more informed and aggressive use of the fashion data that was regularly mined by political candidates themselves during the 2016 primary. Purchases made through each candidate\u2019s online store were used to identify potential issues that could galvanize a voter. For example, if an individual bought an infant onesie from Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign website, it was a clue that said person might be influenced by emails about maternal health. If someone bought a beer mug from Rand Paul, he or she might respond to emails about saving manufacturing in America.\\r\\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all about learning who your supporter base is,\u201d said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst of the NPD Group and the author of \u201cWhy Customers Do What They Do,\u201d in an interview during the 2016 campaign. \u201cHow do they live? What are their trigger points? What words resonate with them? It\u2019s worth its weight in gold, in the political arena just like the consumer arena. We call it demographic profiling, because voter profiling sounds like a dirty word, but that\u2019s what it is.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Fashion profiling is another facet of this approach, using data analysis to identify the way brands are perceived \u2014 and it should not come as a surprise to anyone.\\r\\n<br>Assessing value systems, and goals and priorities, via the clothes people wear has been a part of professional life for years. The \u201cdress for the job you want\u201d adage is an expression of fashion profiling. Calling someone a \u201cGucci person\u201d or a \u201cCeline person\u201d is fashion profiling; opting for Levi\u2019s over Rag & Bone makes a statement about associations and history and opens one up to fashion profiling \u2014 albeit in a manner that generally leaves much unsaid. Cambridge Analytica preyed on that human reality via algorithm, using data from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission. \\r\\n<br>The data breach, which was first revealed in March, plunged Facebook into hot water with American and British lawmakers as it sought to explain how so much of its user data could have been used without those users\u2019 knowledge or consent.\\r\\n<br>The event was just another example of how personal data, given incrementally to products and platforms over years, can be used to manipulate individuals in unanticipated and potentially damaging ways. Mr. Wylie used his talk at the Business of Fashion conference to protest Facebook\u2019s enormous power, and said that the company was damaging society by separating people based on their cultural preferences. He exhorted those present to be conscious of the narratives embedded in their branding.\\r\\n<br>Most Instagram shoppers and selfie-takers are more concerned with credit card theft than being victims of targeted yet subtle political messaging. Still, most users now expect the trail of cultural crumbs they leave online to be used by brands (you\u2019ve bought this, so you may like this!).

Depending on the decision, which could take months, he could be Israel\u2019s first sitting prime minister to be indicted.\\r\\n<br>But for now, his position remains secure.

He appealed directly to the public in a televised address, warning that any attempt to topple the government at such a complex time for national security would be irresponsible.\\r\\n<p>Aside from Gaza, Israel faces serious challenges on its northern frontier, with Iranian efforts to entrench itself in Syria and supply sophisticated weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Mr. Netanyahu has sought to build an international alliance with Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and other predominantly Sunni Muslim countries to counter Iran\u2019s influence in the region, an effort aligned with the Trump administration\u2019s priorities.\\r\\n<br>Having underscored the security challenges Israel faces, Mr. Netanyahu then took over the job of defense minister, adding it to his portfolio, which, in addition to prime minister, already included foreign minister and health minister.\\r\\n<br>In the new case against him, Mr. Netanyahu is not accused of getting rich himself, but of enriching the country\u2019s biggest telecommunications company, Bezeq, at the public\u2019s expense and for the sake of his own image and that of his wife and family.\\r\\n<br>Between 2012 and 2017, Mr. Netanyahu \u201cintervened in a blatant and ongoing manner, and sometimes even daily,\u201d in coverage at Walla, a news website owned by Bezeq, the police said.

In return, Mr. Netanyahu, who personally oversaw the communications ministry from 2014 to 2017, rewarded Bezeq with enormously lucrative concessions, the police said. Those included approval of its merger with Yes, a satellite television company, despite the objections of lower-level ministry officials.\\r\\n<br>The police said they had seized about $32 million from those involved during the investigation.\\r\\n<br>Tzipi Livni, the leader of the opposition in the Israeli Parliament and a former justice minister, called for immediate elections to replace Mr. Netanyahu.\\r\\n<br>\u201cBribery!\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cNetanyahu has to go before he destroys the law enforcement authorities in order to save his own skin.\u201d\\r\\n<p>Avi Gabbay, the leader of the center-left Labor Party and a former chief executive of Bezeq from 2007 to 2013, called on Mr. Netanyahu to resign.\\r\\n<br>\u201cA prime minister with so many corruption scandals surrounding him cannot continue,\u201d he said in a video. \u201cA man motivated by such a sick obsession about what the media will say about him cannot lead Israel.\u201d\\r\\n<br>But experts said a prime minister need not necessarily resign even if formally charged.\\r\\n<br>Abraham Diskin, professor emeritus of political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said the police recommendations were unlikely to change many minds: Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s detractors would be satisfied, while his supporters would see further proof that he is being persecuted.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Diskin, echoing the prime minister, suggested that the police and news media were teaming up to blow the accusations out of proportion.\\r\\n<br>\u201cWhich politician does not try to sway the media?\u201d Mr. Diskin said, adding that the allegations still had to be proven in a court of law.\\r\\n<br>The case was complex, involving a host of other suspects and dozens of witnesses. Besides Mr. Netanyahu, the police recommended on Sunday that his wife, Sara, be charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust, along with disruption of investigative and judicial proceedings.\\r\\n<br>The police also urged the indictment of others on a variety of charges, including Shaul Elovitch, the controlling shareholder of Bezeq; his wife, Iris; their son, Or, an aide to his father and board member in some of their holdings; Stella Handler, chief executive of Bezeq; Amikam Shorer, a senior Bezeq officer; and Zeev Rubinstein, a businessman close to the Elovitch and Netanyahu families who is deputy chairman of the Israel Bonds corporation.\\r\\n<p>Mr. Netanyahu was already facing likely indictment in two other scandals. One case alleges that he accepted gifts worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in exchange for potentially valuable political favors. Another involves an accusation that he negotiated with the publisher of Yediot Ahronot, a leading newspaper, for favorable coverage in exchange for using his influence to curtail a rival paper, Israel Hayom. In that case, the alleged deal never came to fruition.\\r\\n<br>The attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, once considered a Netanyahu loyalist, has indicated he was waiting for the completion of the investigation of the Bezeq case before making a decision on all three cases at once. An indictment could come only after Mr. Netanyahu is given a chance to argue against it at a hearing.\\r\\n<br>Sara Netanyahu is already on trial on fraud and breach of trust charges over allegations that she improperly spent about $100,000 of public funds, hiring celebrity chefs to cater private meals while covering up the fact that the prime minister\u2019s residence already employed a full-time cook.\\r\\n<br>In his response to the new police recommendations on Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu faulted what he called \u201cthe transparent timing of their publication.\u201d Indeed, the announcement was something of a parting shot for Chief Roni Alsheich, whose term ends on Monday and whom Mr. Netanyahu has frequently attacked over the corruption investigations.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s aid to Bezeq took several forms, the police said. Immediately after naming himself communications minister, he fired a top official who had been advancing reforms that would have opened up the market in which Bezeq enjoyed a monopoly. The man Mr. Netanyahu named to the post, Shlomo Filber, was later accused of passing Bezeq inside information. He eventually became a government witness.\\r\\n<br>Not long after, the government pushed through approval of the Bezeq-Yes merger on an accelerated timeline and over the objections of officials who questioned both the rush and the lack of consideration for the interests of consumers, according to an account in Haaretz.\\r\\n<br>The bribes Mr. Netanyahu is accused of receiving included puff pieces and pulled punches. Walla staff members interviewed for a recent Channel 10 documentary about the case told of being pressured and censored most intensively from 2015 to 2017.\\r\\n<p>Often, they said, the family\u2019s image doctor, Nir Hefetz, who also turned state\u2019s witness, was the person who channeled the Netanyahus\u2019 demands.\\r\\n<br>Gali Ginat, a former court reporter, told of writing an article on new accusations that Mrs. Netanyahu had abused employees in the prime minister\u2019s residence, claims widely reported by Walla\u2019s competitors. But soon after it was published, her article disappeared, and she was told that the decision to remove it had come \u201cfrom above.\u201d\\r\\n<br>The news site was also forced to run as many as 10 photos of Mrs. Netanyahu to accompany short articles about her public appearances, employees said.\\r\\n<br>Avi Alkelai, the site\u2019s former chief editor, recalled that after one Walla video interview with Mr. Netanyahu in which he came off \u201cnot bad,\u201d Mr. Hefetz ordered it not be aired and demanded that Mr. Netanyahu be re-interviewed. Two top editors were said to have threatened to resign, and the interview was published. But it appeared high on the home page for only an hour or two before being lowered to a less-prominent position.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Netanyahu angrily disputed the Channel 10 report.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThe attempt to turn basic public relations into part of a bribery deal is ridiculous,\u201d he said, adding that the Walla employees\u2019 allegation \u201cjust proves the extent of the hostility of the site toward the prime minister and his wife.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, acknowledged that police recommendations did not always lead to indictments.

It reminded me of an old video game called Diablo, which had a secret cow level. In it, quickly multiplying bipedal Holsteins surrounded and killed your avatar. \\r\\n<br>That\u2019s about as close as most of us get to Holsteins, which actually walk on all four legs and are very gentle. We all kind of know that, which is why the secret cow level was so weird and disturbing, and perhaps why Gary Larson put them in so many cartoons. That and the guilt so many people feel about their ignorance of the lives of the animals that end up on sesame seed buns.\\r\\n<br>Not only do we eat them, we know almost nothing about them, which no doubt has something to do with why we eat them. But we don\u2019t even know how big they are anymore.\\r\\n<p>Enter Knickers. Now that his meme is waning, it seems that we should all reflect on the simple fact that most of us had no idea how big cattle actually are, how big Holsteins are, and certainly not even an inkling of how big Holstein steers are, and what they do for a living, while they are living. \\r\\n<br>The short answer is that they mostly don\u2019t live past 15 months, because Holsteins are mostly dairy cows. There is no such thing as a dairy steer.\\r\\n<br>When they do live to maturity, around 4 years old, they get really, really, really big, like Knickers. He is 6-foot-4 at the shoulders and weighs about 3,000 pounds. \\r\\n<br>When I was invited to come to the shelter and put Knickers in some perspective, an old song by an old folk singer came to mind, and I heard David Bromberg\u2019s twangy whine insisting, \u201cStand beside me when you measure my size.\u201d So I did.\\r\\n<p>At the shelter here, I stood amid three steers, Orlando, Milbank and Lawrence, all of which reached about 6-foot-4 at the shoulder and weighed 3,000 pounds.\\r\\n<p>Sam, of similar size, was at another barn. And the other Holsteins in the barn, some of whose ears I scratched, were not more than a few inches shorter. What are they? Merely enormous?\\r\\n<br>[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\\r\\n<br>Oh, and there was Tweed, at 6-foot-8. I actually drove to the shelter to see him, but he had some skeletal abnormalities so I wasn\u2019t sure how to count him if we were judging for the record. But the point that Susie Coston, the national shelter director for Farm Sanctuary, wanted to make wasn\u2019t that her cattle could beat out Knickers for some imaginary large animal gold medal.\\r\\n<br>The point, she said, was \u201cthat\u2019s the norm.\u201d We just don\u2019t see them. \\r\\n<br>Or, as Tara Hess, the shelter manager at Watkins Glen, said, \u201cWe don\u2019t actually know what\u2019s normal.\u201d\\r\\n<p>Ms. Hess introduced me to the Holsteins and to Rory the pig and a few chickens, a tiny sampling of the cattle, goats, sheep, ducks, geese, chickens and turkeys that live here. \\r\\n<br>All of them are bigger than the animals raised for food, which are slaughtered young. Among the chickens at the shelter, for instance, is an 18-pound broiler, Ms. Hess said. Broilers are usually slaughtered around eight weeks of age. This one, somehow, happened to grow up.\\r\\n<p>Standing next to the steers was, above all, disturbing. I thought of hamburgers past, as pretty much every nonvegetarian who visits must. And I thought of such vast animals being so inconsequential to the industry that bred them. And I thought about Gary Larson cartoons. \\r\\n<br>By the way, if you think Gary Larson embellished on cow personality, or that cattle would never surround you as they did in Diablo, Ms. Hess said that the idea that cattle have no personality is completely wrong.\\r\\n<br>Not only are they all different \u2014 some like to be scratched, some like you to just back off \u2014 \u201cThey are fiercely loyal to each other.\u201d\\r\\n<br>When one dies, she says, sometimes they won\u2019t let you near the dead animal.

Upper respiratory infections can make it difficult for them to drink.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>I saw a worried mother with a sickish 18-month-old in clinic recently. I say sickish because the mother was much more worried than the toddler was sick; the child was ping-ponging around the room, squirming with outrage when examined, and shrieking with delight when tickled. But she had had some low-grade fevers in recent days, and she was still having some diarrhea, and she had thrown up that morning. Her mother was deeply concerned about dehydration, because, as she kept saying, she knew that was dangerous.\\r\\n<br>She was absolutely right, of course. The message that dehydration is a major risk in babies and small children is one pediatricians have been struggling to deliver for a long time; it\u2019s what we are talking about every time we ask about how many wet diapers a newborn has in a day, as breast-feeding is being established (we are generally happy with six), or every time we go through instructions for how to give fluids to a child with gastroenteritis who is vomiting (wait for 20 to 30 minutes or so and then start giving small sips; call the doctor if the vomiting keeps happening).\\r\\n<br>\u201cIssues of dehydration are very, very common; it\u2019s a big reason why we see patients in outpatient pediatric clinic settings, one of the most common reasons for urgent care and emergency department visits,\u201d said Dr. Emily Rose, an assistant professor of clinical emergency medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California, who is the co-author of a recent review article on the management of dehydration in children.\\r\\n<br>Dr. Rose said that children can get dehydrated from the standard gastroenteritis, with diarrhea and vomiting, but also from any ailment that makes drinking painful, like mouth sores.\\r\\n<p>Thus, especially at this season, when small children have respiratory infections, dehydration is one of the things I\u2019m thinking about when I ask whether their breathing is so heavy or rapid that it\u2019s interfering with nursing or drinking. You always worry about airway and breathing in young children, but I\u2019m also worried about whether enough fluid is getting in there. \\r\\n<br>A baby with respiratory distress can easily get into trouble by what Dr. Rose called \u201cchoosing to breathe rather than drink,\u201d especially since between fever and more rapid respirations, the child is also losing more fluid.\\r\\n<br>So let\u2019s talk about fluid loss, which happens with diarrhea and vomiting, of course, but also happens with fever, rapid respiration, heat and anything else that revs up a child\u2019s metabolism. Small children are especially vulnerable to dehydration for two basic reasons rooted in their essential smallness. \\r\\n<br>First, babies and toddlers contain a  smaller total volume of fluid, so losing a relatively small volume can mean losing a relatively high percent of what is there.\\r\\n<br>And second, the basic surface-area-to-volume ratio is different; the smaller your body, the larger, proportionally, your surface area is, relative to your volume. You learned this back in geometry class with regard to cubes and spheres, and it\u2019s also true of your infant. And what that means is that the infant, with a much smaller amount of fluid in her cells and her blood vessels and everywhere else, has proportionately a much larger surface area over which that fluid can evaporate into the air, especially if she\u2019s feverish \u2014 and you just have to go on putting it back in.\\r\\n<p>Parents should bring children to be checked out if they are acting abnormal, especially if they are lethargic, and if they have decreased or minimal urine output, Dr. Rose said. And children who are dehydrated can for the most part get back all the fluid they need by drinking; IVs are usually not needed. Dr. Rose said that she takes parents through the calculation of how much fluid a child will need to make up a deficit, and to continue replacing ongoing losses.\\r\\n<br>To get that fluid into a dehydrated small child, she said, parents need to give frequent small drinks, often either by spoon or from a dropper or a needleless medication syringe. If children are only mildly dehydrated, she said, parents should use whatever the child is likely to drink, but if the dehydration is more severe, it\u2019s better to use a rehydration solution like Enfalyte or Pedialyte, which also comes in ice pop form, so they get sugar and electrolytes along with the fluid.\\r\\n<br>Dr. Rose said that parents often ask about food, and she tells them to go ahead and feed a child who wants to eat and to go on offering food if the child has diminished appetite. The more the child is eating, she said, the less a parent has to worry. And breast-feeding should be continued; that gives the child calories and protein as well as fluid.\\r\\n<br>So the mother with the 18-month-old was perfectly right to think about dehydration in a child who was having diarrhea and vomiting. \u201cIf you have a kid that doesn\u2019t have dry mucous membranes, when you look in the mouth it\u2019s nice and moist, that\u2019s really reassuring,\u201d Dr. Rose said. On the physical exam, when you\u2019re worried about dehydration in a child, you also check for decreased skin turgor \u2014 that is, skin that doesn\u2019t snap back promptly from being pinched, but this child was nowhere near that level.\\r\\n<br>Two other important signs would be that the child is acting normal, and the eyes don\u2019t look sunken. The research shows, she said, that a child with normal behavior, moist mucous membranes and eyes that are not sunken is probably fine. And my patient\u2019s heart rate was normal, and she was active and happy \u2014 except when I examined her, when she obligingly produced some tears, also signs of normal hydration status. Her mouth had plenty of saliva (doctors write \u201cMMM,\u201d for \u201cmucous membranes moist\u201d). And most reassuring of all, she condescended to drink a bottle, then and there. So we sent her home to keep drinking.\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"health.10.txt\",\"id\":1939608425},{\"title\":\"A Famous Alpha Wolf\u2019s Daughter, Spitfire, Is Killed by a Hunter\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"The shooting of another Lamar Canyon pack member has renewed calls for a buffer between Yellowstone and nearby lands, to protect roaming wolves.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>HELENA, Mont. \u2014 A wild wolf known as 926F, dear to the hearts of wolf watchers who visit Yellowstone, was killed by a hunter as it wandered just outside the park last weekend.\\r\\n<br>A member of the Lamar Canyon pack in the national park\u2019s northeast region, 926F was the daughter of 832F, an alpha female that had become a celebrity, famous for her hunting prowess and for her frequent appearances along the road traveled by tourists in the park\u2019s Lamar Valley.\\r\\n<br>While wolf biologists called the mother 832F, the she-wolf was famously known as \u201c06\u201d for the year she was born.

If the business acquires debts, the creditors can go after the owner's personal possessions. A business structure does not allow for corporate tax rates. The proprietor is personally taxed on all income from the business.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term is also often used colloquially (but not by lawyers or by public officials) to refer to a company. A company, on the other hand, is a separate legal entity and provides for limited liability, as well as corporate tax rates. A company structure is more complicated and expensive to set up, but offers more protection and benefits for the owner.\\r\\n\\r\\nForms\\r\\nMain article: List of business entities\\r\\nForms of business ownership vary by jurisdiction, but several common entities exist:\\r\\n\\r\\nSole proprietorship: A sole proprietorship, also known as a sole trader, is owned by one person and operates for their benefit. The owner operates the business alone and may hire employees. A sole proprietor has unlimited liability for all obligations incurred by the business, whether from operating costs or judgments against the business. All assets of the business belong to a sole proprietor, including, for example, computer infrastructure, any inventory, manufacturing equipment, or retail fixtures, as well as any real property owned by the sole proprietor.\\r\\nPartnership: A partnership is a business owned by two or more people. In most forms of partnerships, each partner has unlimited liability for the debts incurred by the business. The three most prevalent types of for-profit partnerships are: general partnerships, limited partnerships, and limited liability partnerships.[6]\\r\\nCorporation: The owners of a corporation have limited liability and the business has a separate legal personality from its owners. Corporations can be either government-owned or privately owned. They can organize either for profit or as nonprofit organizations. A privately owned, for-profit corporation is owned by its shareholders, who elect a board of directors to direct the corporation and hire its managerial staff. A privately owned, for-profit corporation can be either privately held by a small group of individuals, or publicly held, with publicly traded shares listed on a stock exchange.\\r\\nCooperative: Often referred to as a \\\"co-op\\\", a cooperative is a limited-liability business that can organize as for-profit or not-for-profit. A cooperative differs from a corporation in that it has members, not shareholders, and they share decision-making authority. Cooperatives are typically classified as either consumer cooperatives or worker cooperatives. Cooperatives are fundamental to the ideology of economic democracy.\\r\\nLimited liability companies (LLC), limited liability partnerships, and other specific types of business organization protect their owners or shareholders from business failure by doing business under a separate legal entity with certain legal protections. In contrast, unincorporated businesses or persons working on their own are usually not as protected.[7][8]\\r\\nFranchises: A franchise is a system in which entrepreneurs purchase the rights to open and run a business from a larger corporation.[9] Franchising in the United States is widespread and is a major economic powerhouse. One out of twelve retail businesses in the United States are franchised and 8 million people are employed in a franchised business.[10]\\r\\nA company limited by guarantee: Commonly used where companies are formed for noncommercial purposes, such as clubs or charities. The members guarantee the payment of certain (usually nominal) amounts if the company goes into insolvent liquidation, but otherwise, they have no economic rights in relation to the company. This type of company is common in England. A company limited by guarantee may be with or without having share capital.\\r\\nA company limited by shares: The most common form of the company used for business ventures. Specifically, a limited company is a \\\"company in which the liability of each shareholder is limited to the amount individually invested\\\" with corporations being \\\"the most common example of a limited company.\\\"[11] This type of company is common in England and many English-speaking countries. A company limited by shares may be a\\r\\npublicly traded company or a\\r\\nprivately held company\\r\\nA company limited by guarantee with a share capital: A hybrid entity, usually used where the company is formed for noncommercial purposes, but the activities of the company are partly funded by investors who expect a return. This type of company may no longer be formed in the UK, although provisions still exist in law for them to exist.[12]\\r\\nA limited liability company: \\\"A company\ufffdstatutorily authorized in certain states\ufffdthat is characterized by limited liability, management by members or managers, and limitations on ownership transfer\\\", i.e., L.L.C.[11] LLC structure has been called \\\"hybrid\\\" in that it \\\"combines the characteristics of a corporation and of a partnership or sole proprietorship\\\". Like a corporation, it has limited liability for members of the company, and like a partnership it has \\\"flow-through taxation to the members\\\" and must be \\\"dissolved upon the death or bankruptcy of a member\\\".[13]\\r\\nAn unlimited company with or without a share capital: A hybrid entity, a company where the liability of members or shareholders for the debts (if any) of the company are not limited. In this case doctrine of a veil of incorporation does not apply.\\r\\nLess common types of companies are:\\r\\n\\r\\nCompanies formed by letters patent: Most corporations by letters patent are corporations sole and not companies as the term is commonly understood today.\\r\\nCharter corporations: Before the passing of modern companies legislation, these were the only types of companies. Now they are relatively rare, except for very old companies that still survive (of which there are still many, particularly many British banks), or modern societies that fulfill a quasi-regulatory function (for example, the Bank of England is a corporation formed by a modern charter).\\r\\nStatutory companies: Relatively rare today, certain companies have been formed by a private statute passed in the relevant jurisdiction.\\r\\nNote that \\\"Ltd after the company's name signifies limited company, and PLC (public limited company) indicates that its shares are widely held.\\\"[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn legal parlance, the owners of a company are normally referred to as the \\\"members\\\". In a company limited or unlimited by shares (formed or incorporated with a share capital), this will be the shareholders. In a company limited by guarantee, this will be the guarantors. Some offshore jurisdictions have created special forms of offshore company in a bid to attract business for their jurisdictions. Examples include \\\"segregated portfolio companies\\\" and restricted purpose companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are, however, many, many sub-categories of types of company that can be formed in various jurisdictions in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompanies are also sometimes distinguished for legal and regulatory purposes between public companies and private companies. Public companies are companies whose shares can be publicly traded, often (although not always) on a stock exchange which imposes listing requirements\/Listing Rules as to the issued shares, the trading of shares and future issue of shares to help bolster the reputation of the exchange or particular market of an exchange. Private companies do not have publicly traded shares, and often contain restrictions on transfers of shares. In some jurisdictions, private companies have maximum numbers of shareholders.\\r\\n\\r\\nA parent company is a company that owns enough voting stock in another firm to control management and operations by influencing or electing its board of directors; the second company being deemed as a subsidiary of the parent company. The definition of a parent company differs by jurisdiction, with the definition normally being defined by way of laws dealing with companies in that jurisdiction.\\r\\n\\r\\nClassifications\\r\\nMain article: Industry classification\\r\\nAgriculture, such as the domestication of fish, animals and livestock, as well as lumber, oil and mining businesses that extract natural resources and raw materials, such as wood, petroleum, natural gas, ores, plants or minerals.\\r\\nFinancial services businesses include banks, brokerage firms, credit unions, credit cards, insurance companies, asset and investment companies such as private equity firms, private equity funds, real estate investment trusts, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, mutual funds, index funds, and hedge funds, stock exchanges, and other companies that generate profits through investment and management of capital.\\r\\nEntertainment companies and mass media agencies generate profits primarily from the sale of intellectual property. They include film studios and production houses, mass media companies such as cable television networks, online digital media agencies, talent agencies, mobile media outlets, newspapers, book and magazine publishing houses.\\r\\nIndustrial manufacturers produce products, either from raw materials or from component parts, then export the finished products at a profit. They include tangible goods such as cars, buses, medical devices, glass, or aircraft.\\r\\nReal estate businesses sell, invest, construct and develop properties, including land, residential homes, and other buildings.\\r\\nRetailers, wholesalers, and distributors act as middlemen and get goods produced by manufacturers to the intended consumers; they make their profits by marking up their prices. Most stores and catalog companies are distributors or retailers.\\r\\nTransportation businesses such as railways, airlines, shipping companies that deliver goods and individuals to their destinations for a fee.\\r\\nUtilities produce public services such as water, electricity, waste management or sewage treatment. These industries are usually operated under the charge of a public government.\\r\\nService businesses offer intangible goods or services and typically charge for labor or other services provided to government, to consumers, or to other businesses. Interior decorators, beauticians, hairstylists, make-up artists, tanning salons, laundromats, dry cleaners, and pest controllers are service businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nActivities\\r\\nAccounting\\r\\nMain article: Accounting\\r\\nAccounting is the measurement, processing and communication of financial information about economic entities[15][16] such as businesses and corporations. The modern field was established by the Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli in 1494.[17] Accounting, which has been called the \\\"language of business\\\",[18] measures the results of an organization's economic activities and conveys this information to a variety of users, including investors, creditors, management, and regulators.[19] Practitioners of accounting are known as accountants. The terms \\\"accounting\\\" and \\\"financial reporting\\\" are often used as synonyms.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinance\\r\\nMain article: Finance\\r\\nFinance is a field that deals with the study of investments. It includes the dynamics of assets and liabilities over time under conditions of different degrees of uncertainty and risk. Finance can also be defined as the science of money management. Finance aims to price assets based on their risk level and their expected rate of return. Finance can be broken into three different sub-categories: public finance, corporate finance and personal finance.\\r\\n\\r\\nManufacturing\\r\\nMain article: Manufacturing\\r\\nManufacturing is the production of merchandise for use or sale using labour and machines, tools, chemical and biological processing, or formulation. The term may refer to a range of human activity, from handicraft to high tech, but is most commonly applied to industrial production, in which raw materials are transformed into finished goods on a large scale.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarketing\\r\\nMain article: Marketing\\r\\nMarketing is defined by the American Marketing Association as \\\"the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.\\\"[20] The term developed from the original meaning which referred literally to going to a market to buy or sell goods or services. Marketing tactics include advertising as well as determining product pricing.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the rise in technology, marketing is further divided into a class called digital marketing. It is marketing products and services using digital technologies.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch and development\\r\\nMain article: Research and development\\r\\nResearch and development refer to activities in connection with corporate or government innovation. Research and development constitute the first stage of development of a potential new service or product. Research and development are very difficult to manage since the defining feature of the research is that the researchers do not know in advance exactly how to accomplish the desired result.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSafety\\r\\nMain article: Safety\\r\\nSafety is a key business concept that is defined by Merriam-Webster as \ufffdthe condition of being safe from undergoing or causing hurt, injury, or loss\ufffd.[21] Injuries cost businesses billions of dollars annually.[22] Studies have shown how company acceptance and implementation of comprehensive safety and health management systems reduces incidents, insurance costs and workers\ufffd compensation claims.[23] New technologies, like wearable safety devices[24] and available online safety training, continue to be developed to encourage employers to invest in protection beyond the \\\"canary in the coalmine\\\" and reduce the cost to businesses of protecting their employees.\\r\\n\\r\\nSales\\r\\nMain article: Sales\\r\\nSales are activity related to selling or the amount of goods or services sold in a given time period. Sales are often integrated with all lines of business and are key to a companies' success.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganization and regulation\\r\\nSee also: Theory of the firm\\r\\nMost legal jurisdictions specify the forms of ownership that a business can take, creating a body of commercial law for each type.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major factors affecting how a business is organized are usually:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe size and scope of the business firm and its structure, management, and ownership, broadly analyzed in the theory of the firm. Generally, a smaller business is more flexible, while larger businesses, or those with wider ownership or more formal structures, will usually tend to be organized as corporations or (less often) partnerships. In addition, a business that wishes to raise money on a stock market or to be owned by a wide range of people will often be required to adopt a specific legal form to do so.\\r\\nThe sector and country. Private profit-making businesses are different from government-owned bodies. In some countries, certain businesses are legally obliged to be organized in certain ways.\\r\\nTax advantages. Different structures are treated differently in tax law and may have advantages for this reason.\\r\\nDisclosure and compliance requirements. Different business structures may be required to make less or more information public (or report it to relevant authorities) and may be bound to comply with different rules and regulations.\\r\\nMany businesses are operated through a separate entity such as a corporation or a partnership (either formed with or without limited liability). Most legal jurisdictions allow people to organize such an entity by filing certain charter documents with the relevant Secretary of State or equivalent and complying with certain other ongoing obligations. The relationships and legal rights of shareholders, limited partners, or members are governed partly by the charter documents and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the entity is organized. Generally speaking, shareholders in a corporation, limited partners in a limited partnership, and members in a limited liability company are shielded from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the entity, which is legally treated as a separate \\\"person\\\". This means that unless there is misconduct, the owner's own possessions are strongly protected in law if the business does not succeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere two or more individuals own a business together but have failed to organize a more specialized form of vehicle, they will be treated as a general partnership. The terms of a partnership are partly governed by a partnership agreement if one is created, and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. No paperwork or filing is necessary to create a partnership, and without an agreement, the relationships and legal rights of the partners will be entirely governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. A single person who owns and runs a business is commonly known as a sole proprietor, whether that person owns it directly or through a formally organized entity. Depending on the business needs, an adviser can decide what kind is proprietorship will be most suitable.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few relevant factors to consider in deciding how to operate a business include:\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral partners in a partnership (other than a limited liability partnership), plus anyone who personally owns and operates a business without creating a separate legal entity, are personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business.\\r\\nGenerally, corporations are required to pay tax just like \\\"real\\\" people. In some tax systems, this can give rise to so-called double taxation, because first the corporation pays tax on the profit, and then when the corporation distributes its profits to its owners, individuals have to include dividends in their income when they complete their personal tax returns, at which point a second layer of income tax is imposed.\\r\\nIn most countries, there are laws which treat small corporations differently from large ones. They may be exempt from certain legal filing requirements or labor laws, have simplified procedures in specialized areas, and have simplified, advantageous, or slightly different tax treatment.\\r\\n\\\"Going public\\\" through a process known as an initial public offering (IPO) means that part of the business will be owned by members of the public. This requires the organization as a distinct entity, to disclose information to the public, and adhering to a tighter set of laws and procedures. Most public entities are corporations that have sold shares, but increasingly there are also public LLC's that sell units (sometimes also called shares), and other more exotic entities as well, such as, for example, real estate investment trusts in the USA, and unit trusts in the UK. A general partnership cannot \\\"go public\\\".\\r\\nCommercial law\\r\\nMain article: Corporate law\\r\\n\\r\\nOffices in the Los Angeles Downtown Financial District\\r\\nA very detailed and well-established body of rules that evolved over a very long period of time applies to commercial transactions. The need to regulate trade and commerce and resolve business disputes helped shape the creation of law and courts. The Code of Hammurabi dates back to about 1772 BC for example, and contains provisions that relate, among other matters, to shipping costs and dealings between merchants and brokers.[27] The word \\\"corporation\\\" derives from the Latin corpus, meaning body, and the Maurya Empire in Iron-Age India accorded legal rights to business entities.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many countries, it is difficult to compile all the laws that can affect a business into a single reference source. Laws can govern treatment of labour and employee relations, worker protection and safety, discrimination on the basis of age, gender, disability, race, and in some jurisdictions, sexual orientation, and the minimum wage, as well as unions, worker compensation, and working hours and leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome specialized businesses may also require licenses, either due to laws governing entry into certain trades, occupations or professions, that require special education or to raise revenue for local governments. Professions that require special licenses include law, medicine, piloting aircraft, selling liquor, radio broadcasting, selling investment securities, selling used cars, and roofing. Local jurisdictions may also require special licenses and taxes just to operate a business.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome businesses are subject to ongoing special regulation, for example, public utilities, investment securities, banking, insurance, broadcasting, aviation, and health care providers. Environmental regulations are also very complex and can affect many businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nCapital\\r\\n\\r\\nMexican Stock Exchange in Paseo de la Reforma, Mexico City\\r\\nWhen businesses need to raise money (called capital), they sometimes offer securities for sale.\\r\\n\\r\\nCapital may be raised through private means, by an initial public offering or IPO on a stock exchange, or in other ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor stock exchanges include the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Singapore Exchange, Hong Kong Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ (the USA), the London Stock Exchange (UK), the Tokyo Stock Exchange (Japan), and Bombay Stock Exchange (India). Most countries with capital markets have at least one.\\r\\n\\r\\nBusinesses that have gone public are subject to regulations concerning their internal governance, such as how executive officers' compensation is determined, and when and how information is disclosed to shareholders and to the public. In the United States, these regulations are primarily implemented and enforced by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Other western nations have comparable regulatory bodies. The regulations are implemented and enforced by the China Securities Regulation Commission (CSRC) in China. In Singapore, the regulatory authority is the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and in Hong Kong, it is the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proliferation and increasing complexity of the laws governing business have forced increasing specialization in corporate law. It is not unheard of for certain kinds of corporate transactions to require a team of five to ten attorneys due to sprawling regulation. Commercial law spans general corporate law, employment and labor law, health-care law, securities law, mergers and acquisitions, tax law, employee benefit plans, food and drug regulation, intellectual property law on copyrights, patents, trademarks, telecommunications law, and financing.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther types of capital sourcing include crowdsourcing on the Internet, venture capital, bank loans, and debentures.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntellectual property\\r\\nMain article: Intellectual property\\r\\nBusinesses often have important \\\"intellectual property\\\" that needs protection from competitors for the company to stay profitable. This could require patents, copyrights, trademarks, or preservation of trade secrets. Most businesses have names, logos, and similar branding techniques that could benefit from trademarking. Patents and copyrights in the United States are largely governed by federal law, while trade secrets and trademarking are mostly a matter of state law. Because of the nature of intellectual property, a business needs protection in every jurisdiction in which they are concerned about competitors. Many countries are signatories to international treaties concerning intellectual property, and thus companies registered in these countries are subject to national laws bound by these treaties. In order to protect trade secrets, companies may require employees to sign noncompete clauses which will impose limitations on an employee's interactions with stakeholders, and competitors.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrade union\\r\\nMain article: Trade union\\r\\nA trade union (or labor union) is an organization of workers who have come together to achieve common goals such as protecting the integrity of its trade, improving safety standards, achieving higher pay and benefits such as health care and retirement, increasing the number of employees an employer assigns to complete the work, and better working conditions. The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members (rank and file members) and negotiates labor contracts (collective bargaining) with employers. The most common purpose of these associations or unions is \\\"maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment\\\".[29] This may include the negotiation of wages, work rules, complaint procedures, rules governing hiring, firing, and promotion of workers, benefits, workplace safety and policies.\",\"evals\":[],\"id\":643957705},{\"title\":\"health\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"See also: Social determinants of health and Risk factor\\rGenerally, the context in which an individual lives is of great importance for both his health status and quality of their life[18].

It is increasingly recognized that health is maintained and improved not only through the advancement and application of health science, but also through the efforts and intelligent lifestyle choices of the individual and society. According to the World Health Organization, the main determinants of health include the social and economic environment, the physical environment and the person's individual characteristics and behaviors.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nMore specifically, key factors that have been found to influence whether people are healthy or unhealthy include the following:[19][20][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIncome and social status\\r\\nSocial support networks\\r\\nEducation and literacy\\r\\nEmployment\/working conditions\\r\\nSocial environments\\r\\nPhysical environments\\r\\nPersonal health practices and coping skills\\r\\nHealthy child development\\r\\nBiology and genetics\\r\\nHealth care services\\r\\nGender\\r\\nCulture\\r\\n\\r\\nDonald Henderson as part of the CDC's smallpox eradication team in 1966.\\r\\nAn increasing number of studies and reports from different organizations and contexts examine the linkages between health and different factors, including lifestyles, environments, health care organization and health policy, one specific health policy brought into many countries in recent years was the introduction of the sugar tax. Beverage taxes came into light with increasing concerns about obesity, particularly among youth. Sugar-sweetened beverages have become a target of anti-obesity initiatives with increasing evidence of their link to obesity.[22]\ufffd such as the 1974 Lalonde report from Canada;[21] the Alameda County Study in California;[23] and the series of World Health Reports of the World Health Organization, which focuses on global health issues including access to health care and improving public health outcomes, especially in developing countries.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe concept of the \\\"health field,\\\" as distinct from medical care, emerged from the Lalonde report from Canada. The report identified three interdependent fields as key determinants of an individual's health. These are:[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nLifestyle: the aggregation of personal decisions (i.e., over which the individual has control) that can be said to contribute to, or cause, illness or death;\\r\\nEnvironmental: all matters related to health external to the human body and over which the individual has little or no control;\\r\\nBiomedical: all aspects of health, physical and mental, developed within the human body as influenced by genetic make-up.\\r\\nThe maintenance and promotion of health is achieved through different combination of physical, mental, and social well-being, together sometimes referred to as the \\\"health triangle.\\\"[25][26] The WHO's 1986 Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion further stated that health is not just a state, but also \\\"a resource for everyday life, not the objective of living. Health is a positive concept emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities.\\\"[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nFocusing more on lifestyle issues and their relationships with functional health, data from the Alameda County Study suggested that people can improve their health via exercise, enough sleep, maintaining a healthy body weight, limiting alcohol use, and avoiding smoking.[28] Health and illness can co-exist, as even people with multiple chronic diseases or terminal illnesses can consider themselves healthy.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe environment is often cited as an important factor influencing the health status of individuals. This includes characteristics of the natural environment, the built environment and the social environment. Factors such as clean water and air, adequate housing, and safe communities and roads all have been found to contribute to good health, especially to the health of infants and children.[19][30] Some studies have shown that a lack of neighborhood recreational spaces including natural environment leads to lower levels of personal satisfaction and higher levels of obesity, linked to lower overall health and well being.[31] This suggests that the positive health benefits of natural space in urban neighborhoods should be taken into account in public policy and land use.\\r\\n\\r\\nGenetics, or inherited traits from parents, also play a role in determining the health status of individuals and populations. This can encompass both the predisposition to certain diseases and health conditions, as well as the habits and behaviors individuals develop through the lifestyle of their families. For example, genetics may play a role in the manner in which people cope with stress, either mental, emotional or physical. For example, obesity is a significant problem in the United States that contributes to bad mental health and causes stress in the lives of great numbers of people[32]. (One difficulty is the issue raised by the debate over the relative strengths of genetics and other factors; interactions between genetics and environment may be of particular importance.)\\r\\n\\r\\nPotential issues\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of types of health issues are common around the globe. Disease is one of the most common. According to GlobalIssues.org, approximately 36 million people die each year from non-communicable (not contagious) disease including cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic lung disease (Shah, 2014).\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong communicable diseases, both viral and bacterial, AIDS\/HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria are the most common, causing millions of deaths every year (Shah, 2014).\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother health issue that causes death or contributes to other health problems is malnutrition, especially among children. One of the groups malnutrition affects most is young children. Approximately 7.5 million children under the age of 5 die from malnutrition, usually brought on by not having the money to find or make food (Shah, 2014).\\r\\n\\r\\nBodily injuries are also a common health issue worldwide. These injuries, including broken bones, fractures, and burns can reduce a person's quality of life or can cause fatalities including infections that resulted from the injury or the severity injury in general (Moffett, 2013).[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nLifestyle choices are contributing factors to poor health in many cases. These include smoking cigarettes, and can also include a poor diet, whether it is overeating or an overly constrictive diet. Inactivity can also contribute to health issues and also a lack of sleep, excessive alcohol consumption, and neglect of oral hygiene (Moffett2013).There are also genetic disorders that are inherited by the person and can vary in how much they affect the person and when they surface (Moffett, 2013).\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the majority of these health issues are preventable, a major contributor to global ill health is the fact that approximately 1 billion people lack access to health care systems (Shah, 2014). Arguably, the most common and harmful health issue is that a great many people do not have access to quality remedies.[34][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nMental health\\r\\nMain article: Mental health\\r\\nThe World Health Organization describes mental health as \\\"a state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community\\\".[36] Mental Health is not just the absence of mental illness.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nMental illness is described as 'the spectrum of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral conditions that interfere with social and emotional well-being and the lives and productivity of people. Having a mental illness can seriously impair, temporarily or permanently, the mental functioning of a person. Other terms include: 'mental health problem', 'illness', 'disorder', 'dysfunction'.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nRoughly a quarter of all adults 18 and over in the US are considered diagnosable with mental illness. Mental illnesses are the leading cause of disability in the US and Canada. Examples include, schizophrenia, ADHD, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and autism.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany teens suffer from mental health issues in response to the pressures of society and social problems they encounter. Some of the key mental health issues seen in teens are: depression, eating disorders, and drug abuse. There are many ways to prevent these health issues from occurring such as communicating well with a teen suffering from mental health issues. Mental health can be treated and be attentive to teens' behavior.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\n Many factors contribute to mental health problems, including:\\r\\n\\r\\nBiological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry\\r\\nLife experiences, such as trauma or abuse\\r\\nFamily history of mental health problems\\r\\nMaintaining\\r\\nAchieving and maintaining health is an ongoing process, shaped by both the evolution of health care knowledge and practices as well as personal strategies and organized interventions for staying healthy.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet\\r\\nMain articles: Healthy diet and Human nutrition\\r\\n\\r\\nPercentage of overweight or obese population in 2010, Data source: OECD's iLibrary, http:\/\/stats.oecd.org[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nPercentage of obese population in 2010, Data source: OECD's iLibrary, http:\/\/stats.oecd.org[42]\\r\\nAn important way to maintain your personal health is to have a healthy diet. A healthy diet includes a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods that provide nutrients to your body. Such nutrients give you energy and keep your body running. Nutrients help build and strengthen bones, muscles, and tendons and also regulate body processes (i.e. blood pressure). The food guide pyramid is a pyramid-shaped guide of healthy foods divided into sections. Each section shows the recommended intake for each food group (i.e. Protein, Fat, Carbohydrates, and Sugars). Making healthy food choices is important because it can lower your risk of heart disease, developing some types of cancer, and it will contribute to maintaining a healthy weight.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mediterranean diet is commonly associated with health-promoting effects due to the fact that it contains some bioactive compounds like phenolic compounds, isoprenoids and alkaloids.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nExercise\\r\\nMain article: Exercise\\r\\nPhysical exercise enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness. It strengthens muscles and improves the cardiovascular system. According to the National Institutes of Health, there are four types of exercise: endurance, strength, flexibility, and balance.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nSleep\\r\\nMain articles: Sleep and Sleep deprivation\\r\\nSleep is an essential component to maintaining health. In children, sleep is also vital for growth and development. Ongoing sleep deprivation has been linked to an increased risk for some chronic health problems. In addition, sleep deprivation has been shown to correlate with both increased susceptibility to illness and slower recovery times from illness.[46] In one study, people with chronic insufficient sleep, set as six hours of sleep a night or less, were found to be four times more likely to catch a cold compared to those who reported sleeping for seven hours or more a night.[47] Due to the role of sleep in regulating metabolism, insufficient sleep may also play a role in weight gain or, conversely, in impeding weight loss.[48] Additionally, in 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is the cancer research agency for the World Health Organization, declared that \\\"shiftwork that involves circadian disruption is probably carcinogenic to humans,\\\" speaking to the dangers of long-term nighttime work due to its intrusion on sleep.[49] In 2015, the National Sleep Foundation released updated recommendations for sleep duration requirements based on age and concluded that \\\"Individuals who habitually sleep outside the normal range may be exhibiting signs or symptoms of serious health problems or, if done volitionally, may be compromising their health and well-being.\\\"[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nRole of science\\r\\nMain articles: Health science and Health care\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dutch Public Health Service provides medical care for the natives of the Dutch East Indies, May 1946\\r\\nHealth science is the branch of science focused on health. There are two main approaches to health science: the study and research of the body and health-related issues to understand how humans (and animals) function, and the application of that knowledge to improve health and to prevent and cure diseases and other physical and mental impairments. The science builds on many sub-fields, including biology, biochemistry, physics, epidemiology, pharmacology, medical sociology. Applied health sciences endeavor to better understand and improve human health through applications in areas such as health education, biomedical engineering, biotechnology and public health.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganized interventions to improve health based on the principles and procedures developed through the health sciences are provided by practitioners trained in medicine, nursing, nutrition, pharmacy, social work, psychology, occupational therapy, physical therapy and other health care professions. Clinical practitioners focus mainly on the health of individuals, while public health practitioners consider the overall health of communities and populations. Workplace wellness programs are increasingly adopted by companies for their value in improving the health and well-being of their employees, as are school health services in order to improve the health and well-being of children.\\r\\n\\r\\nRole of public health\\r\\nMain article: Public health\\r\\nSee also: Global health\\r\\n\\r\\nPostage stamp, New Zealand, 1933. Public health has been promoted \ufffd and depicted \ufffd in a wide variety of ways.\\r\\nPublic health has been described as \\\"the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations, public and private, communities and individuals.\\\"[51] It is concerned with threats to the overall health of a community based on population health analysis. The population in question can be as small as a handful of people or as large as all the inhabitants of several continents (for instance, in the case of a pandemic). Public health has many sub-fields, but typically includes the interdisciplinary categories of epidemiology, biostatistics and health services. Environmental health, community health, behavioral health, and occupational health are also important areas of public health.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe focus of public health interventions is to prevent and manage diseases, injuries and other health conditions through surveillance of cases and the promotion of healthy behavior, communities, and (in aspects relevant to human health) environments. Its aim is to prevent health problems from happening or re-occurring by implementing educational programs, developing policies, administering services and conducting research.[52] In many cases, treating a disease or controlling a pathogen can be vital to preventing it in others, such as during an outbreak. Vaccination programs and distribution of condoms to prevent the spread of communicable diseases are examples of common preventive public health measures, as are educational campaigns to promote vaccination and the use of condoms (including overcoming resistance to such).\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic health also takes various actions to limit the health disparities between different areas of the country and, in some cases, the continent or world. One issue is the access of individuals and communities to health care in terms of financial, geographical or socio-cultural constraints to accessing and using services.[53] Applications of the public health system include the areas of maternal and child health, health services administration, emergency response, and prevention and control of infectious and chronic diseases.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great positive impact of public health programs is widely acknowledged. Due in part to the policies and actions developed through public health, the 20th century registered a decrease in the mortality rates for infants and children and a continual increase in life expectancy in most parts of the world. For example, it is estimated that life expectancy has increased for Americans by thirty years since 1900,[54] and worldwide by six years since 1990.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nSelf-care strategies\\r\\nMain article: Self care\\r\\nSee also: Chronic care management, Social relation, and Stress management\\r\\n\\r\\nA lady washing her hands c. 1655\\r\\nPersonal health depends partially on the active, passive, and assisted cues people observe and adopt about their own health. These include personal actions for preventing or minimizing the effects of a disease, usually a chronic condition, through integrative care. They also include personal hygiene practices to prevent infection and illness, such as bathing and washing hands with soap; brushing and flossing teeth; storing, preparing and handling food safely; and many others. The information gleaned from personal observations of daily living \ufffd such as about sleep patterns, exercise behavior, nutritional intake and environmental features \ufffd may be used to inform personal decisions and actions (e.g., \\\"I feel tired in the morning so I am going to try sleeping on a different pillow\\\"), as well as clinical decisions and treatment plans (e.g., a patient who notices his or her shoes are tighter than usual may be having exacerbation of left-sided heart failure, and may require diuretic medication to reduce fluid overload).[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonal health also depends partially on the social structure of a person's life. The maintenance of strong social relationships, volunteering, and other social activities have been linked to positive mental health and also increased longevity. One American study among seniors over age 70, found that frequent volunteering was associated with reduced risk of dying compared with older persons who did not volunteer, regardless of physical health status.[57] Another study from Singapore reported that volunteering retirees had significantly better cognitive performance scores, fewer depressive symptoms, and better mental well-being and life satisfaction than non-volunteering retirees.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nProlonged psychological stress may negatively impact health, and has been cited as a factor in cognitive impairment with aging, depressive illness, and expression of disease.[59] Stress management is the application of methods to either reduce stress or increase tolerance to stress. Relaxation techniques are physical methods used to relieve stress. Psychological methods include cognitive therapy, meditation, and positive thinking, which work by reducing response to stress. Improving relevant skills, such as problem solving and time management skills, reduces uncertainty and builds confidence, which also reduces the reaction to stress-causing situations where those skills are applicable.\\r\\n\\r\\nOccupational\\r\\nMain article: Occupational safety and health\\r\\nIn addition to safety risks, many jobs also present risks of disease, illness and other long-term health problems. Among the most common occupational diseases are various forms of pneumoconiosis, including silicosis and coal worker's pneumoconiosis (black lung disease). Asthma is another respiratory illness that many workers are vulnerable to. Workers may also be vulnerable to skin diseases, including eczema, dermatitis, urticaria, sunburn, and skin cancer.[60][61] Other occupational diseases of concern include carpal tunnel syndrome and lead poisoning.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the number of service sector jobs has risen in developed countries, more and more jobs have become sedentary, presenting a different array of health problems than those associated with manufacturing and the primary sector. Contemporary problems, such as the growing rate of obesity and issues relating to stress and overwork in many countries, have further complicated the interaction between work and health.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany governments view occupational health as a social challenge and have formed public organizations to ensure the health and safety of workers. Examples of these include the British Health and Safety Executive and in the United States, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which conducts research on occupational health and safety, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which handles regulation and policy relating to worker safety and health.[62][63][64]\",\"evals\":[],\"id\":-1897987410},{\"title\":\"science\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"The earliest roots of science can be traced to Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3500 to 3000 BCE.[3][4] Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal ...\",\"content\":\"Science (from Latin scientia, meaning \\\"knowledge\\\")[1] is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.[2][a]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest roots of science can be traced to Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3500 to 3000 BCE.[3][4] Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to explain events of the physical world based on natural causes.[3][4] After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, knowledge of Greek conceptions of the world deteriorated in Western Europe during the early centuries (400 to 1000 CE) of the Middle Ages[5] but was preserved in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age.[6] The recovery and assimilation of Greek works and Islamic inquiries into Western Europe from the 10th to 13th century revived natural philosophy,[5][7] which was later transformed by the Scientific Revolution that began in the 16th century[8] as new ideas and discoveries departed from previous Greek conceptions and traditions.[9][10][11][12] The scientific method soon played a greater role in knowledge creation and it was not until the 19th century that many of the institutional and professional features of science began to take shape.[13][14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nModern science is typically divided into three major branches that consist of the natural sciences (e.g., biology, chemistry, and physics), which study nature in the broadest sense; the social sciences (e.g., economics, psychology, and sociology), which study individuals and societies; and the formal sciences (e.g., logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science), which study abstract concepts. There is disagreement,[16][17] however, on whether the formal sciences actually constitute a science as they do not rely on empirical evidence.[18] Disciplines that utilize existing scientific knowledge for practical purposes, such as engineering and medicine, are described as applied sciences.[19][20][21][22]\\r\\n\\r\\nScience is based on research, which is commonly conducted in academic and research institutions as well as in government agencies and companies. The practical impact of scientific research has led to the emergence of science policies that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by prioritizing the development of commercial products, armaments, health care, and environmental protection.\\r\\n\\r\\nBranches of science\\r\\nMain article: Branches of science\\r\\nModern science is commonly divided into three major branches that consist of the natural sciences, social sciences, and formal sciences. Each of these branches comprise various specialized yet overlapping scientific disciplines that often possess their own nomenclature and expertise.[88] Both natural and social sciences are empirical sciences[89] as their knowledge are based on empirical observations and are capable of being tested for its validity by other researchers working under the same conditions.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also closely related disciplines that use science, such as engineering and medicine.\\r\\n\\r\\nNatural science\\r\\nMain articles: Natural science and Outline of natural science\\r\\n\\r\\nFalse-color composite of global oceanic and terrestrial photoautotroph abundance by the SeaWiFS Project, NASA\/Goddard Space Flight Center, and ORBIMAGE.\\r\\nNatural science is concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of natural phenomena based on empirical evidence from observation and experimentation. It can be divided into two main branches: life science (or biological science) and physical science. Physical science is subdivided into branches, including physics, chemistry, astronomy and earth science. These two branches may be further divided into more specialized disciplines. Modern natural science is the successor to the natural philosophy that began in Ancient Greece. Galileo, Descartes, Bacon, and Newton debated the benefits of using approaches which were more mathematical and more experimental in a methodical way. Still, philosophical perspectives, conjectures, and presuppositions, often overlooked, remain necessary in natural science.[91] Systematic data collection, including discovery science, succeeded natural history, which emerged in the 16th century by describing and classifying plants, animals, minerals, and so on.[92] Today, \\\"natural history\\\" suggests observational descriptions aimed at popular audiences.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nSocial science\\r\\nMain articles: Social science and Outline of social science\\r\\n\\r\\nIn economics, the supply and demand model describes how prices vary as a result of a balance between product availability and demand.\\r\\nSocial science is concerned with society and the relationships among individuals within a society. It has many branches that include, but are not limited to, anthropology, archaeology, communication studies, economics, history, human geography, jurisprudence, linguistics, political science, psychology, public health, and sociology. Social scientists may adopt various philosophical theories to study individuals and society. For example, positivist social scientists use methods resembling those of the natural sciences as tools for understanding society, and so define science in its stricter modern sense. Interpretivist social scientists, by contrast, may use social critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing empirically falsifiable theories, and thus treat science in its broader sense. In modern academic practice, researchers are often eclectic, using multiple methodologies (for instance, by combining both quantitative and qualitative research). The term \\\"social research\\\" has also acquired a degree of autonomy as practitioners from various disciplines share in its aims and methods.\\r\\n\\r\\nFormal science\\r\\nMain articles: Formal science and Outline of formal science\\r\\n\\r\\nA humanoid robotic hand (see Shadow Hand system).\\r\\nFormal science is involved in the study of formal systems. It includes mathematics,[94][95] systems theory, robotics, and theoretical computer science. The formal sciences share similarities with the other two branches by relying on objective, careful, and systematic study of an area of knowledge. They are, however, different from the empirical sciences as they rely exclusively on deductive reasoning, without the need for empirical evidence, to verify their abstract concepts.[18][96][97] The formal sciences are therefore a priori disciplines and because of this, there is disagreement on whether they actually constitute a science.[16][17] Nevertheless, the formal sciences play an important role in the empirical sciences. Calculus, for example, was initially invented to understand motion in physics.[98] Natural and social sciences that rely heavily on mathematical applications include mathematical physics, mathematical chemistry, mathematical biology, mathematical finance, and mathematical economics.\\r\\n\\r\\nScientific research\\r\\nSee also: Research\\r\\nScientific research can be labeled as either basic or applied research. Basic research is the search for knowledge and applied research is the search for solutions to practical problems using this knowledge. Although some scientific research is applied research into specific problems, a great deal of our understanding comes from the curiosity-driven undertaking of basic research. This leads to options for technological advance that were not planned or sometimes even imaginable. This point was made by Michael Faraday when allegedly in response to the question \\\"what is the use of basic research?\\\" he responded: \\\"Sir, what is the use of a new-born child?\\\".[99] For example, research into the effects of red light on the human eye's rod cells did not seem to have any practical purpose; eventually, the discovery that our night vision is not troubled by red light would lead search and rescue teams (among others) to adopt red light in the cockpits of jets and helicopters.[100]:106\ufffd10 Finally, even basic research can take unexpected turns, and there is some sense in which the scientific method is built to harness luck.\\r\\n\\r\\nScientific method\\r\\nMain article: Scientific method\\r\\n\\r\\nThe central star IRAS 10082-5647 was captured by the Advanced Camera for Surveys aboard the Hubble Space Telescope.\\r\\nScientific research involves using the scientific method, which seeks to objectively explain the events of nature in a reproducible way.[g] An explanatory thought experiment or hypothesis is put forward as explanation using principles such as parsimony (also known as \\\"Occam's Razor\\\") and are generally expected to seek consilience \ufffd fitting well with other accepted facts related to the phenomena.[101] This new explanation is used to make falsifiable predictions that are testable by experiment or observation. The predictions are to be posted before a confirming experiment or observation is sought, as proof that no tampering has occurred. Disproof of a prediction is evidence of progress.[h][i] This is done partly through observation of natural phenomena, but also through experimentation that tries to simulate natural events under controlled conditions as appropriate to the discipline (in the observational sciences, such as astronomy or geology, a predicted observation might take the place of a controlled experiment). Experimentation is especially important in science to help establish causal relationships (to avoid the correlation fallacy).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a hypothesis proves unsatisfactory, it is either modified or discarded.[102] If the hypothesis survived testing, it may become adopted into the framework of a scientific theory, a logically reasoned, self-consistent model or framework for describing the behavior of certain natural phenomena. A theory typically describes the behavior of much broader sets of phenomena than a hypothesis; commonly, a large number of hypotheses can be logically bound together by a single theory. Thus a theory is a hypothesis explaining various other hypotheses. In that vein, theories are formulated according to most of the same scientific principles as hypotheses. In addition to testing hypotheses, scientists may also generate a model, an attempt to describe or depict the phenomenon in terms of a logical, physical or mathematical representation and to generate new hypotheses that can be tested, based on observable phenomena.[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile performing experiments to test hypotheses, scientists may have a preference for one outcome over another, and so it is important to ensure that science as a whole can eliminate this bias.[104][105] This can be achieved by careful experimental design, transparency, and a thorough peer review process of the experimental results as well as any conclusions.[106][107] After the results of an experiment are announced or published, it is normal practice for independent researchers to double-check how the research was performed, and to follow up by performing similar experiments to determine how dependable the results might be.[108] Taken in its entirety, the scientific method allows for highly creative problem solving while minimizing any effects of subjective bias on the part of its users (especially the confirmation bias).[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nRole of mathematics\\r\\nMain articles: Mathematics and Formal science\\r\\n\\r\\nCalculus, the mathematics of continuous change, underpins many of the sciences.\\r\\nMathematics is essential in the formation of hypotheses, theories, and laws[110] in the natural and social sciences. For example, it is used in quantitative scientific modeling, which can generate new hypotheses and predictions to be tested. It is also used extensively in observing and collecting measurements. Statistics, a branch of mathematics, is used to summarize and analyze data, which allow scientists to assess the reliability and variability of their experimental results.\\r\\n\\r\\nComputational science applies computing power to simulate real-world situations, enabling a better understanding of scientific problems than formal mathematics alone can achieve. According to the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, computation is now as important as theory and experiment in advancing scientific knowledge.[111]\\r\\n\\r\\nVerifiability\\r\\nJohn Ziman points out that intersubjective verifiability is fundamental to the creation of all scientific knowledge.[112]:44 Ziman shows how scientists can identify patterns to each other across centuries; he refers to this ability as \\\"perceptual consensibility.\\\"[113]:46 He then makes consensibility, leading to consensus, the touchstone of reliable knowledge.[113]:104\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilosophy of science\\r\\nSee also: Philosophy of science\\r\\n\\r\\nEnglish philosopher and physician John Locke (1632\ufffd1704), a leading philosopher of British empiricism\\r\\nScientists usually take for granted a set of basic assumptions that are needed to justify the scientific method: (1) that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers; (2) that this objective reality is governed by natural laws; (3) that these laws can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation.[24] Philosophy of science seeks a deep understanding of what these underlying assumptions mean and whether they are valid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe belief that scientific theories should and do represent metaphysical reality is known as realism. It can be contrasted with anti-realism, the view that the success of science does not depend on it being accurate about unobservable entities such as electrons. One form of anti-realism is idealism, the belief that the mind or consciousness is the most basic essence, and that each mind generates its own reality.[j] In an idealistic world view, what is true for one mind need not be true for other minds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are different schools of thought in philosophy of science. The most popular position is empiricism,[k] which holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation and that scientific theories are the result of generalizations from such observations.[114] Empiricism generally encompasses inductivism, a position that tries to explain the way general theories can be justified by the finite number of observations humans can make and hence the finite amount of empirical evidence available to confirm scientific theories. This is necessary because the number of predictions those theories make is infinite, which means that they cannot be known from the finite amount of evidence using deductive logic only. Many versions of empiricism exist, with the predominant ones being Bayesianism[115] and the hypothetico-deductive method.[116]:236\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Austrian-British philosopher of science Karl Popper (1902\ufffd1994) in 1990. He is best known for his work on empirical falsification.\\r\\nEmpiricism has stood in contrast to rationalism, the position originally associated with Descartes, which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect, not by observation.[116]:20 Critical rationalism is a contrasting 20th-century approach to science, first defined by Austrian-British philosopher Karl Popper. Popper rejected the way that empiricism describes the connection between theory and observation. He claimed that theories are not generated by observation, but that observation is made in the light of theories and that the only way a theory can be affected by observation is when it comes in conflict with it.[116]:63\ufffd67 Popper proposed replacing verifiability with falsifiability as the landmark of scientific theories and replacing induction with falsification as the empirical method.[116]:68 Popper further claimed that there is actually only one universal method, not specific to science: the negative method of criticism, trial and error.[117] It covers all products of the human mind, including science, mathematics, philosophy, and art.[118]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother approach, instrumentalism, colloquially termed \\\"shut up and multiply,\\\"[119] emphasizes the utility of theories as instruments for explaining and predicting phenomena.[120] It views scientific theories as black boxes with only their input (initial conditions) and output (predictions) being relevant. Consequences, theoretical entities, and logical structure are claimed to be something that should simply be ignored and that scientists shouldn't make a fuss about (see interpretations of quantum mechanics). Close to instrumentalism is constructive empiricism, according to which the main criterion for the success of a scientific theory is whether what it says about observable entities is true.\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas Kuhn argued that the process of observation and evaluation takes place within a paradigm, a logically consistent \\\"portrait\\\" of the world that is consistent with observations made from its framing. He characterized normal science as the process of observation and \\\"puzzle solving\\\" which takes place within a paradigm, whereas revolutionary science occurs when one paradigm overtakes another in a paradigm shift.[121] Each paradigm has its own distinct questions, aims, and interpretations. The choice between paradigms involves setting two or more \\\"portraits\\\" against the world and deciding which likeness is most promising. A paradigm shift occurs when a significant number of observational anomalies arise in the old paradigm and a new paradigm makes sense of them. That is, the choice of a new paradigm is based on observations, even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm. For Kuhn, acceptance or rejection of a paradigm is a social process as much as a logical process. Kuhn's position, however, is not one of relativism.[122]\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, another approach often cited in debates of scientific skepticism against controversial movements like \\\"creation science\\\" is methodological naturalism. Its main point is that a difference between natural and supernatural explanations should be made and that science should be restricted methodologically to natural explanations.[l] That the restriction is merely methodological (rather than ontological) means that science should not consider supernatural explanations itself, but should not claim them to be wrong either. Instead, supernatural explanations should be left a matter of personal belief outside the scope of science. Methodological naturalism maintains that proper science requires strict adherence to empirical study and independent verification as a process for properly developing and evaluating explanations for observable phenomena.[123] The absence of these standards, arguments from authority, biased observational studies and other common fallacies are frequently cited by supporters of methodological naturalism as characteristic of the non-science they criticize.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainty and science\\r\\nA scientific theory is empirical[k][124] and is always open to falsification if new evidence is presented. That is, no theory is ever considered strictly certain as science accepts the concept of fallibilism.[m] The philosopher of science Karl Popper sharply distinguished truth from certainty. He wrote that scientific knowledge \\\"consists in the search for truth,\\\" but it \\\"is not the search for certainty ... All human knowledge is fallible and therefore uncertain.\\\"[125]:4\\r\\n\\r\\nNew scientific knowledge rarely results in vast changes in our understanding. According to psychologist Keith Stanovich, it may be the media's overuse of words like \\\"breakthrough\\\" that leads the public to imagine that science is constantly proving everything it thought was true to be false.[100]:119\ufffd38 While there are such famous cases as the theory of relativity that required a complete reconceptualization, these are extreme exceptions. Knowledge in science is gained by a gradual synthesis of information from different experiments by various researchers across different branches of science; it is more like a climb than a leap.[100]:123 Theories vary in the extent to which they have been tested and verified, as well as their acceptance in the scientific community.[n] For example, heliocentric theory, the theory of evolution, relativity theory, and germ theory still bear the name \\\"theory\\\" even though, in practice, they are considered factual.[126] Philosopher Barry Stroud adds that, although the best definition for \\\"knowledge\\\" is contested, being skeptical and entertaining the possibility that one is incorrect is compatible with being correct. Therefore, scientists adhering to proper scientific approaches will doubt themselves even once they possess the truth.[127] The fallibilist C. S. Peirce argued that inquiry is the struggle to resolve actual doubt and that merely quarrelsome, verbal, or hyperbolic doubt is fruitless[128] \ufffd but also that the inquirer should try to attain genuine doubt rather than resting uncritically on common sense.[129] He held that the successful sciences trust not to any single chain of inference (no stronger than its weakest link) but to the cable of multiple and various arguments intimately connected.[130]\\r\\n\\r\\nStanovich also asserts that science avoids searching for a \\\"magic bullet\\\"; it avoids the single-cause fallacy. This means a scientist would not ask merely \\\"What is the cause of ...\\\", but rather \\\"What are the most significant causes of ...\\\". This is especially the case in the more macroscopic fields of science (e.g. psychology, physical cosmology).[100]:141\ufffd47 Research often analyzes few factors at once, but these are always added to the long list of factors that are most important to consider.[100]:141\ufffd47 For example, knowing the details of only a person's genetics, or their history and upbringing, or the current situation may not explain a behavior, but a deep understanding of all these variables combined can be very predictive.\\r\\n\\r\\nFringe science, pseudoscience, and junk science\\r\\nAn area of study or speculation that masquerades as science in an attempt to claim a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is sometimes referred to as pseudoscience, fringe science, or junk science.[o] Physicist Richard Feynman coined the term \\\"cargo cult science\\\" for cases in which researchers believe they are doing science because their activities have the outward appearance of science but actually lack the \\\"kind of utter honesty\\\" that allows their results to be rigorously evaluated.[131] Various types of commercial advertising, ranging from hype to fraud, may fall into these categories.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere can also be an element of political or ideological bias on all sides of scientific debates. Sometimes, research may be characterized as \\\"bad science,\\\" research that may be well-intended but is actually incorrect, obsolete, incomplete, or over-simplified expositions of scientific ideas. The term \\\"scientific misconduct\\\" refers to situations such as where researchers have intentionally misrepresented their published data or have purposely given credit for a discovery to the wrong person.[132]\\r\\n\\r\\nScientific literature\\r\\nMain article: Scientific literature\\r\\n\\r\\nCover of the first volume of the scientific journal Science in 1880.\\r\\nScientific research is published in an enormous range of scientific literature.[133] Scientific journals communicate and document the results of research carried out in universities and various other research institutions, serving as an archival record of science. The first scientific journals, Journal des S\ufffdavans followed by the Philosophical Transactions, began publication in 1665. Since that time the total number of active periodicals has steadily increased. In 1981, one estimate for the number of scientific and technical journals in publication was 11,500.[134] The United States National Library of Medicine currently indexes 5,516 journals that contain articles on topics related to the life sciences. Although the journals are in 39 languages, 91 percent of the indexed articles are published in English.[135]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost scientific journals cover a single scientific field and publish the research within that field; the research is normally expressed in the form of a scientific paper. Science has become so pervasive in modern societies that it is generally considered necessary to communicate the achievements, news, and ambitions of scientists to a wider populace.\\r\\n\\r\\nScience magazines such as New Scientist, Science & Vie, and Scientific American cater to the needs of a much wider readership and provide a non-technical summary of popular areas of research, including notable discoveries and advances in certain fields of research. Science books engage the interest of many more people. Tangentially, the science fiction genre, primarily fantastic in nature, engages the public imagination and transmits the ideas, if not the methods, of science.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecent efforts to intensify or develop links between science and non-scientific disciplines such as literature or more specifically, poetry, include the Creative Writing Science resource developed through the Royal Literary Fund.[136]\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch\\tImpact\\r\\nStatic electricity and magnetism (c. 1600)\\r\\nElectric current (18th century)\\tAll electric appliances, dynamos, electric power stations, modern electronics, including electric lighting, television, electric heating, transcranial magnetic stimulation, deep brain stimulation, magnetic tape, loudspeaker, and the compass and lightning rod.\\r\\nDiffraction (1665)\\tOptics, hence fiber optic cable (1840s), modern intercontinental communications, and cable TV and internet\\r\\nGerm theory (1700)\\tHygiene, leading to decreased transmission of infectious diseases; antibodies, leading to techniques for disease diagnosis and targeted anticancer therapies.\\r\\nVaccination (1798)\\tLeading to the elimination of most infectious diseases from developed countries and the worldwide eradication of smallpox.\\r\\nPhotovoltaic effect (1839)\\tSolar cells (1883), hence solar power, solar powered watches, calculators and other devices.\\r\\nThe strange orbit of Mercury (1859) and other research\\r\\nleading to special (1905) and general relativity (1916)\\tSatellite-based technology such as GPS (1973), satnav and satellite communications[p]\\r\\nRadio waves (1887)\\tRadio had become used in innumerable ways beyond its better-known areas of telephony, and broadcast television (1927) and radio (1906) entertainment.

He also won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his work in theoretical physics.\\r\\nScientists are individuals who conduct scientific research to advance knowledge in an area of interest.[137][138] The term scientist was coined by William Whewell in 1833. In modern times, many professional scientists are trained in an academic setting and upon completion, attain an academic degree, with the highest degree being a doctorate such as a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD),[139] Doctor of Medicine (MD), or Doctor of Engineering (DEng). Many scientists pursue careers in various sectors of the economy such as academia, industry, government, and nonprofit environments.[140][141][142]\\r\\n\\r\\nScientists include experimentalists who mainly who perform experiments to test hypotheses and theoreticians who mainly develop new models to explain existing data and predict new results. Many have a desire to understand why the world is as we see it and how it came to be. They exhibit a strong curiosity about reality. Other motivations are recognition by their peers and prestige. The Nobel Prize, a widely regarded prestigious award,[143] is awarded annually to those who have achieved scientific advances in the fields of medicine, physics, chemistry, and economics. Some scientists have a desire to apply scientific knowledge for the benefit of people's health, nations, environment, or industries.\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen in science\\r\\nMain article: Women in science\\r\\nFurther information: Women in STEM fields\\r\\n\\r\\nMarie Curie was the first person to be awarded two Nobel Prizes: Physics in 1903 and Chemistry in 1911.[144]\\r\\nScience has historically been a male-dominated field, with some notable exceptions.[q] Women faced considerable discrimination in science, much as they did in other areas of male-dominated societies, such as frequently being passed over for job opportunities and denied credit for their work.[r] For example, Christine Ladd (1847\ufffd1930) was able to enter a PhD program as \\\"C. Ladd\\\"; Christine \\\"Kitty\\\" Ladd completed the requirements in 1882, but was awarded her degree only in 1926, after a career which spanned the algebra of logic (see truth table), color vision, and psychology. Her work preceded notable researchers like Ludwig Wittgenstein and Charles Sanders Peirce. The achievements of women in science have been attributed to their defiance of their traditional role as laborers within the domestic sphere.[145]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 20th century, active recruitment of women and elimination of institutional discrimination on the basis of sex greatly increased the number of women scientists, but large gender disparities remain in some fields; over half of new biologists are female, while 80% of PhDs in physics are given to men.[citation needed] Feminists claim this is the result of culture rather than an innate difference between the sexes, and some experiments have shown that parents challenge and explain more to boys than girls, asking them to reflect more deeply and logically.[146]: 258\ufffd61. In the early part of the 21st century, women in the United States earned 50.3% of bachelor's degrees, 45.6% of master's degrees, and 40.7% of PhDs in science and engineering fields. They earned more than half of the degrees in psychology (about 70%), social sciences (about 50%), and biology (about 50-60%) but earned less than half the degrees in the physical sciences, earth sciences, mathematics, engineering, and computer science.[147] Lifestyle choice also plays a major role in female engagement in science; women with young children are 28% less likely to take tenure-track positions due to work-life balance issues,[148] and female graduate students' interest in careers in research declines dramatically over the course of graduate school, whereas that of their male colleagues remains unchanged.[149]\\r\\n\\r\\nLearned societies\\r\\nFurther information: Learned society\\r\\n\\r\\nPhysicists in front of the Royal Society building in London (1952).\\r\\nLearned societies for the communication and promotion of scientific thought and experimentation have existed since the Renaissance.[150] Many scientists belong to a learned society that promotes their respective scientific discipline, profession, or group of related disciplines.[151] Membership may be open to all, may require possession of some qualifications, or may be an honor conferred by election.[152] Membership often requires possession of some scientific credentials, or may be an honor conferred by election. Most scientific societies are non-profit organizations, and many are professional associations. Their activities typically include holding regular conferences for the presentation and discussion of new research results and publishing or sponsoring academic journals in their discipline. Some also act as professional bodies, regulating the activities of their members in the public interest or the collective interest of the membership. Scholars in the sociology of science[who?] argue that learned societies are of key importance and their formation assists in the emergence and development of new disciplines or professions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe professionalization of science, begun in the 19th century, was partly enabled by the creation of distinguished academy of sciences in a number of countries such as the Italian Accademia dei Lincei in 1603,[153] the British Royal Society in 1660, the French Acad\ufffdmie des Sciences in 1666,[154] the American National Academy of Sciences in 1863, the German Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in 1911, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1928. International scientific organizations, such as the International Council for Science, have since been formed to promote cooperation between the scientific communities of different nations.\\r\\n\\r\\nScience and the public\\r\\n\\\"Science and society\\\" redirects here. For the academic journal, see Science & Society.\\r\\nScience policy\\r\\nMain articles: Science policy, History of science policy, and Economics of science\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United Nations Global Science-Policy-Business Forum on the Environment in Nairobi, Kenya (2017).\\r\\nScience policy is an area of public policy concerned with the policies that affect the conduct of the scientific enterprise, including research funding, often in pursuance of other national policy goals such as technological innovation to promote commercial product development, weapons development, health care and environmental monitoring. Science policy also refers to the act of applying scientific knowledge and consensus to the development of public policies. Science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve the natural sciences. In accordance with public policy being concerned about the well-being of its citizens, science policy's goal is to consider how science and technology can best serve the public.\\r\\n\\r\\nState policy has influenced the funding of public works and science for thousands of years, particularly within civilizations with highly organized governments such as imperial China and the Roman Empire. Prominent historical examples include the Great Wall of China, completed over the course of two millennia through the state support of several dynasties, and the Grand Canal of the Yangtze River, an immense feat of hydraulic engineering begun by Sunshu Ao (??? 7th c. BCE), Ximen Bao (??? 5th c.BCE), and Shi Chi (4th c. BCE). This construction dates from the 6th century BCE under the Sui Dynasty and is still in use today. In China, such state-supported infrastructure and scientific research projects date at least from the time of the Mohists, who inspired the study of logic during the period of the Hundred Schools of Thought and the study of defensive fortifications like the Great Wall of China during the Warring States period.\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic policy can directly affect the funding of capital equipment and intellectual infrastructure for industrial research by providing tax incentives to those organizations that fund research. Vannevar Bush, director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development for the United States government, the forerunner of the National Science Foundation, wrote in July 1945 that \\\"Science is a proper concern of government.\\\"[155]\\r\\n\\r\\nFunding of science\\r\\nMain article: Funding of science\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Main Entomology Building in Australia\\r\\nScientific research is often funded through a competitive process in which potential research projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive funding. Such processes, which are run by government, corporations, or foundations, allocate scarce funds. Total research funding in most developed countries is between 1.5% and 3% of GDP.[156] In the OECD, around two-thirds of research and development in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry, and 20% and 10% respectively by universities and government. The government funding proportion in certain industries is higher, and it dominates research in social science and humanities. Similarly, with some exceptions (e.g. biotechnology) government provides the bulk of the funds for basic scientific research. Many governments have dedicated agencies to support scientific research. Prominent scientific organizations include the National Science Foundation in the United States, the National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Argentina, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia, Centre national de la recherche scientifique in France, the Max Planck Society and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft in Germany, and CSIC in Spain. In commercial research and development, all but the most research-oriented corporations focus more heavily on near-term commercialisation possibilities rather than \\\"blue-sky\\\" ideas or technologies (such as nuclear fusion).\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic awareness of science\\r\\nMain article: Public awareness of science\\r\\nFurther information: Science outreach and Science communication\\r\\n\\r\\nDinosaur exhibit in the Houston Museum of Natural Science\\r\\nThe public awareness of science relates to the attitudes, behaviors, opinions, and activities that make up the relations between science and the general public. it integrates various themes and activities such as science communication, science museums, science festivals, science fairs, citizen science, and science in popular culture. Social scientists have devised various metrics to measure the public understanding of science such as factual knowledge, self-reported knowledge, and structural knowledge.[157][158]\\r\\n\\r\\nScience journalism\\r\\nMain article: Science journalism\\r\\nThe mass media face a number of pressures that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims in terms of their credibility within the scientific community as a whole. Determining how much weight to give different sides in a scientific debate may require considerable expertise regarding the matter.[159] Few journalists have real scientific knowledge, and even beat reporters who know a great deal about certain scientific issues may be ignorant about other scientific issues that they are suddenly asked to cover.[160][161]\\r\\n\\r\\nPoliticization of science\\r\\nMain article: Politicization of science\\r\\n\\r\\nResults of seven papers from 2004\ufffd2015 assessing the overwhelming scientific consensus on man-made global warming (see Surveys of scientists' views on climate change), in contrast to the political controversy over this issue, particularly in the United States.\\r\\nPoliticization of science occurs when government, business, or advocacy groups use legal or economic pressure to influence the findings of scientific research or the way it is disseminated, reported, or interpreted. Many factors can act as facets of the politicization of science such as populist anti-intellectualism, perceived threats to religious beliefs, postmodernist subjectivism, and fear for business interests.[162] Politicization of science is usually accomplished when scientific information is presented in a way that emphasizes the uncertainty associated with the scientific evidence.[163] Tactics such as shifting conversation, failing to acknowledge facts, and capitalizing on doubt of scientific consensus have been used to gain more attention for views that have been undermined by scientific evidence.[164] Examples of issues that have involved the politicization of science include the global warming controversy, health effects of pesticides, and health effects of tobacco.[164][165]\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"evals\":[],\"id\":-2067386457},{\"title\":\"technology\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools.

Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's environment. Innovations have always influenced the values of a society and raised new questions of the ethics of technology. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of the term \\\"technology\\\" has changed significantly over the last 200 years. Before the 20th century, the term was uncommon in English, and it was used either to refer to the description or study of the useful arts[3] or to allude to technical education, as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (chartered in 1861).[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\\"technology\\\" rose to prominence in the 20th century in connection with the Second Industrial Revolution. The term's meanings changed in the early 20th century when American social scientists, beginning with Thorstein Veblen, translated ideas from the German concept of Technik into \\\"technology.\\\" In German and other European languages, a distinction exists between technik and technologie that is absent in English, which usually translates both terms as \\\"technology.\\\" By the 1930s, \\\"technology\\\" referred not only to the study of the industrial arts but to the industrial arts themselves.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1937, the American sociologist Read Bain wrote that \\\"technology includes all tools, machines, utensils, weapons, instruments, housing, clothing, communicating and transporting devices and the skills by which we produce and use them.\\\"[6] Bain's definition remains common among scholars today, especially social scientists. Scientists and engineers usually prefer to define technology as applied science, rather than as the things that people make and use.[7] More recently, scholars have borrowed from European philosophers of \\\"technique\\\" to extend the meaning of technology to various forms of instrumental reason, as in Foucault's work on technologies of the self (techniques de soi).\\r\\n\\r\\nDictionaries and scholars have offered a variety of definitions. The Merriam-Webster Learner's Dictionary offers a definition of the term: \\\"the use of science in industry, engineering, etc., to invent useful things or to solve problems\\\" and \\\"a machine, piece of equipment, method, etc., that is created by technology.\\\"[8] Ursula Franklin, in her 1989 \\\"Real World of Technology\\\" lecture, gave another definition of the concept; it is \\\"practice, the way we do things around here.\\\"[9] The term is often used to imply a specific field of technology, or to refer to high technology or just consumer electronics, rather than technology as a whole.[10] Bernard Stiegler, in Technics and Time, 1, defines technology in two ways: as \\\"the pursuit of life by means other than life,\\\" and as \\\"organized inorganic matter.\\\"[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnology can be most broadly defined as the entities, both material and immaterial, created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value. In this usage, technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve real-world problems. It is a far-reaching term that may include simple tools, such as a crowbar or wooden spoon, or more complex machines, such as a space station or particle accelerator. Tools and machines need not be material; virtual technology, such as computer software and business methods, fall under this definition of technology.[12] W. Brian Arthur defines technology in a similarly broad way as \\\"a means to fulfill a human purpose.\\\"[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word \\\"technology\\\" can also be used to refer to a collection of techniques. In this context, it is the current state of humanity's knowledge of how to combine resources to produce desired products, to solve problems, fulfill needs, or satisfy wants; it includes technical methods, skills, processes, techniques, tools and raw materials. When combined with another term, such as \\\"medical technology\\\" or \\\"space technology,\\\" it refers to the state of the respective field's knowledge and tools. \\\"State-of-the-art technology\\\" refers to the high technology available to humanity in any field.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe invention of integrated circuits and the microprocessor (here, an Intel 4004 chip from 1971) led to the modern computer revolution.\\r\\nTechnology can be viewed as an activity that forms or changes culture.[14] Additionally, technology is the application of math, science, and the arts for the benefit of life as it is known. A modern example is the rise of communication technology, which has lessened barriers to human interaction and as a result has helped spawn new subcultures; the rise of cyberculture has at its basis the development of the Internet and the computer.[15] Not all technology enhances culture in a creative way; technology can also help facilitate political oppression and war via tools such as guns. As a cultural activity, technology predates both science and engineering, each of which formalize some aspects of technological endeavor.\\r\\n\\r\\naspects of technological endeavor.\\r\\n\\r\\nScience, engineering and technology\\r\\n\\r\\nAntoine Lavoisier conducting an experiment with combustion generated by amplified sun light\\r\\nThe distinction between science, engineering, and technology is not always clear. Science is systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation.[16] Technologies are not usually exclusively products of science, because they have to satisfy requirements such as utility, usability, and safety.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nEngineering is the goal-oriented process of designing and making tools and systems to exploit natural phenomena for practical human means, often (but not always) using results and techniques from science. The development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge, including scientific, engineering, mathematical, linguistic, and historical knowledge, to achieve some practical result.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnology is often a consequence of science and engineering, although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields. For example, science might study the flow of electrons in electrical conductors by using already-existing tools and knowledge. This new-found knowledge may then be used by engineers to create new tools and machines such as semiconductors, computers, and other forms of advanced technology. In this sense, scientists and engineers may both be considered technologists; the three fields are often considered as one for the purposes of research and reference.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exact relations between science and technology in particular have been debated by scientists, historians, and policymakers in the late 20th century, in part because the debate can inform the funding of basic and applied science. In the immediate wake of World War II, for example, it was widely considered in the United States that technology was simply \\\"applied science\\\" and that to fund basic science was to reap technological results in due time. An articulation of this philosophy could be found explicitly in Vannevar Bush's treatise on postwar science policy, Science \ufffd The Endless Frontier: \\\"New products, new industries, and more jobs require continuous additions to knowledge of the laws of nature ... This essential new knowledge can be obtained only through basic scientific research.\\\"[18] In the late-1960s, however, this view came under direct attack, leading towards initiatives to fund science for specific tasks (initiatives resisted by the scientific community). The issue remains contentious, though most analysts resist the model that technology simply is a result of scientific research.[19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"evals\":[],\"id\":-876433920},{\"title\":\"world\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"Although in most of the English-speaking world this field is not usually regarded as a specific specialization for journalists, it is so in nearly all the world.

For journalism, it is a branch that deals with news either sent by foreign correspondents or news agencies, or \ufffd more recently \ufffd information that is gathered or researched through distance communication technologies, such as telephone, satellite TV or the internet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough in most of the English-speaking world this field is not usually regarded as a specific specialization for journalists, it is so in nearly all the world. Particularly in the United States, there is a blurred distinction between world news and \\\"national\\\" news when they include directly the national government or national institutions, such as wars in which the US are involved or summits of multilateral organizations in which the US are a member.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the birth of modern journalism, most news were foreign, as registered by the courants of the 17th century in West and Central Europe, such as the Daily Courant (England), the Nieuwe Tijudinger (Antwerp), the Relation (Strasbourg), the Avisa Relation oder Zeitung (Wolfenb\ufffdttel) and the Courante Uyt Italien, Duytsland & C. (Amsterdam). Since these papers were aimed at bankers and merchants, they brought mostly news from other markets, which usually meant other nations. In any case, it is worthy to remark that nation-states were still incipient in 17th-century Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the 19th century on, with newspapers already established in Europe, the United States and a few other countries, innovations in telecommunications such as the telegraph made news from abroad easier to be spread. The first news agencies were then founded, like AFP (France), Reuters (UK), Wolff (currently DPA, Germany) and the AP (US).\\r\\n\\r\\nWar journalism is one of the best known subfields of world news (although war coverage can be national for the media of belligerent countries themselves).\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are essentially two types of reporters who do foreign reporting: the foreign correspondent (full-time reporter employed by a news source) and the special envoy (sent abroad to cover a specific subject, temporarily stationed in a location).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe correspondent is a reporter based in a foreign city (often the capital of a country) covering a region, a country or sometimes even an entire continent. He or she regularly files stories to the news editor. He\/she gathers materials for these stories from local officials, members of the community, and the local media, as well as from events he\/she directly witnesses. Correspondents typically stay in touch with the local community and maintain contacts with other journalists and correspondents in order to identify strategic sources in the government, among diplomats, members of the military and other organizations on the ground who may provide important information.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of foreign correspondents has dropped significantly over the past 20 years or more. Often, a media company is either uninterested or unable to afford to support a single correspondent, such as in many developing countries. In some places, they cannot obtain visas due to political constraints, or otherwise dangerous conditions prohibit a media company from stationing a reporter there. In recent years, the drop in foreign correspondents has been due to cutbacks within media companies (often, but not always, a result of economics alone).[1] Among English language newspapers, only eight daily newspapers have full-time correspondents in more than ten foreign stations, four from the US, three from the UK and one from India:\\r\\n\\r\\n35 \ufffd Wall Street Journal (US): Baghdad, Bangkok, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Brussels, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Istanbul, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, Kuala Lumpur, Lagos, London, Manila, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, Paris, Prague, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, S\ufffdo Paulo, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Taipei, Tokyo, Toronto, Zurich\\r\\n\\r\\n24 \ufffd New York Times (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Cairo, Caracas, Dakar, Hong Kong, Islamabad, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Rome, S\ufffdo Paulo, Shanghai, Tokyo\\r\\n\\r\\n19 \ufffd Financial Times (UK): Beijing, Berlin, Bombay, Brussels, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, New York, Paris, Taipei, Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney, Washington\\r\\n\\r\\n17 \ufffd Washington Post (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Berlin, Bogot\ufffd, Cairo, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Shanghai, Tehran, Tokyo\\r\\n\\r\\n15 \ufffd The Guardian (UK): Accra, Bangkok, Beijing, Berlin, Brussels, Kabul, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Los Angeles, Madrid, New York, Paris, Rome, Tehran, Tokyo\\r\\n\\r\\n13 \ufffd The Daily Telegraph (UK): Beijing, Brussels, Jerusalem, Kabul, Los Angeles, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, New York, Paris, Shanghai, Sydney, Washington\\r\\n\\r\\n13 \ufffd Los Angeles Times (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Cairo, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, New Delhi, Seoul\\r\\n\\r\\n12 \ufffd The Hindu (India): Addis Ababa, Beijing, Colombo, Dhaka, Dubai, Islamabad, Kathmandu, London, Moscow, Paris, Singapore, Washington\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen reporters working abroad have no permanent labor contract with media outlets, they are called stringers.

Both use their iPhones to interact with the outside world \u2014 sometimes to the chagrin of Mr. Trump\u2019s security advisers and critics.\\r\\nThe president is not as technologically savvy as the first lady. His aides slip him paper copies of news articles, and when he travels on Air Force One, an aide is often spotted carrying around these mysterious-looking cardboard boxes. They are full of paper documents. The president will often sift through the papers when he needs to refer to something \u2014 which can be where that famous Sharpie of his comes into play.\\r\\nMrs. Trump is more tech oriented. She uses Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, mainly on her phone. Like her husband, she is very interested in her coverage but also uses those tools to keep track of things she\u2019s interested in, including fashion design, magazines and astrology. (She\u2019s a Taurus and follows the @taurusismagic account on Twitter, which has an interesting bio.)\\r\\nShe keeps in touch with staff in person, but also through lots of email and texts. When planning events, she will do internet searches to find things she likes and then gives staff photos of what she wants, or draws things, with the Be Best logo being one example. She also uses email, text, phone calls and Signal to keep in touch with her contacts. \\r\\n(What a coincidence: I use Signal, too. Mrs. Trump, call me.)\\r\\nHow have you seen White House tech evolve under President Trump?\\r\\nI think moment-to-moment digital coverage of every single thing the president does is new with this White House. President Barack Obama had people tracking his movements through Twitter and beyond, but with this administration, journalists live-tweet, photograph and send video from pool sprays (brief Oval Office events) and Marine One departures, in addition to news conferences. \\r\\nIf I\u2019m on the road, it\u2019s easy for me to tune into a pool spray or speech through someone else\u2019s Periscope live-streaming account, for instance. And when the president is at one of his properties, including the Trump Hotel or Mar-a-Lago, I often lurk on Instagram to see who is hanging out with him.\\r\\nThe Trump White House also had journalists switch over to an in-house Wi-Fi network, which made some reporters understandably uncomfortable for security reasons. The West Wing has also made more use out of devices that scan for gadgets including phones \u2014 I can understand why Signal is so popular. I think the anxiety over surveillance is perhaps more heightened than it was under the Obama administration, which, by the way, did its part to pave the way for these types of procedures.\\r\\nWhat are your most important tech tools for keeping up with breaking news from the White House and talking to your sources?\\r\\nI\u2019ve been on this beat since January. I thought I was pretty much tethered to the news before, but this job requires you to imbibe a daily tidal wave of news. So that\u2019s fun.\\r\\nA lot of my monitoring is Twitter-based, so I use tools I\u2019ve relied on for years. I use Nuzzel, a social news app that lets me know what the people I follow on social media are sharing, which is helpful for identifying the stories getting traction. And I use Twitter\u2019s list function to sort all of the noise into manageable buckets: I have lists of White House reporters, politicians, White House aides and Washington chatterboxes.\\r\\nOutside of a few news apps, I dislike having notifications on my phone in general \u2014 my eyes tend to glaze over if I have too many \u2014 but I receive them from a few news organizations and whenever the president or his press secretary tweets. Several of my colleagues have the Apple Watch, which gives them a friendly little jolt when those tweets happen. I haven\u2019t been able to bring myself to cross that particular Pavlovian bridge yet.\\r\\nLiving and working in Washington have a way of narrowing your perception, so I try to make sure I understand what people outside my bubble are talking about and reading. On my computer, I use Tweetdeck \u2014 which helps manage Twitter accounts \u2014 to display a list of prominent conservatives, which runs alongside a list of journalists. It\u2019s interesting and instructive to see how the two worlds function in real time, especially when news hits.\\r\\nThis beat is competitive, and building it from scratch has meant using a lot of research tools \u2014 Nexis for phone numbers, Spokeo for social media accounts \u2014 and making a lot of cold calls and sending emails. (If I really need something, I\u2019ll go to your doorstep.) I\u2019ve also learned that calling from a blocked number leads people in the president\u2019s orbit to believe the call is coming from the White House, so they answer right away.\\r\\nI text or WhatsApp with my sources, and we often transition to Signal. With the caveat that nothing is perfectly secure, Signal encryption tends to provide peace of mind, especially since it comes with a function that allows messages to wipe out after a certain period. I have some sources who set their messages to dissolve after a few minutes, which has come in handy if they\u2019re sending documents.\\r\\nSpeaking of security, I use two-factor authentication on everything, and LastPass to save my passwords, because I\u2019m constantly forgetting what mine are.\\r\\nWhat could be better about some of these tools?\\r\\nThis is just a small thing, but you know how Snapchat will show you if someone screen-grabs your message? That would be interesting to have in Signal, but absolutely no one would use Signal if that function existed.\\r\\nAlso, Twitter can be a minefield of bad intentions and lost context. There is a performative aspect to being on that platform that I don\u2019t enjoy. So since 2016, I have used a service called TweetDelete, which gets rid of my tweets that are more than a week old. I was sort of wistful when I saw my entire Twitter history wiped out and delivered to me in a spreadsheet, but I have no regrets.\\r\\nOutside of work, what tech product do you and your family love? \\r\\nI wouldn\u2019t say my husband and I are particularly tech savvy. We still enjoy having good old-fashioned squabbles over the thermostat, so we don\u2019t have a smart home.\\r\\nAt home, I love having friends and loved ones over, so I use the NYT Cooking app to help find recipes to feed them. (I spent the fall perfecting an apple butter rugelach.) I love apps for travel, including Kayak, Hotel Tonight and Airbnb. And on my last vacation, which took me pretty far north, I downloaded Aurora Pro and Sky Guide to view the Perseid meteor shower.\\r\\nGiven the gig, I can have a hard time focusing or winding down, so I have been experimenting with meditation apps. I recently downloaded one called Happy Not Perfect.

She bought a birthing ball, hired a doula and even practiced hypnotherapy.\\r\\nHer plan was to deliver at the Mount Sinai West Birthing Center, an area of the hospital marked by pastel curtains, family-size beds and large birthing tubs. Separated from the regular labor and delivery floor, it is for women who want a natural childbirth with minimal medical intervention.\\r\\nYet after arriving in triage, Ms. Binderow, 35, was made to wait. And wait.\\r\\n\u201cThey kept coming back to tell me that the birthing center was closed, and they had no other rooms available,\u201d she said. As the minutes turned into hours, Ms. Binderow was forced to labor on an aluminum bed \u2014 there was not a mattress or even sheets for comfort. The only thing that separated her from other women in labor was a thin curtain. There was no chair for her husband, let alone space for her birthing ball, which was left to roll around in the hallway.\\r\\nAfter five hours, she was ready to push. \u201cThe baby was coming, and I was still in triage,\u201d she said. Eventually, a proper hospital bed arrived. Orderlies then rolled Ms. Binderow down the hall and into a room that was filled with all sorts of equipment.\\r\\n\u201cIt was a storage room,\u201d she said.\\r\\nAs Ms. Binderow was gripped by waves of intensifying contractions, staffers cleared out the space to make room for her bed. Minutes later, Siena Binderow was born there.\\r\\nIt isn\u2019t easy to have a natural, nonmedicated birth in New York. After years of hospitals trying to accommodate the option, most seem to be slowly backing away from the idea. The Mount Sinai West Birthing Center, which features just three birthing rooms, is often closed because of staffing issues or mothers who get \u201crisked out\u201d of the program for complicating factors like high blood pressure or stalled labor. And on Dec. 31, it will be shutting its doors for good.\\r\\nLast year, Ms. Binderow was one of more than 1,000 women who registered at the birthing center to have a baby there. Yet of those, only 200 mothers were actually admitted \u2014 less than 20 percent \u2014 according to Save the Birthing Center, a group of mothers, midwives and doulas petitioning to keep Mount Sinai West\u2019s center open. This year, even as news broke that the center would close, more than 990 women had signed up for it.\\r\\nThe demand for natural childbirth does not seem to be going away. In the United States, there are more than 350 free-standing (meaning that they are not located inside hospitals) birthing centers, an 82 percent increase since 2010, according to the American Association of Birth Centers. Texas has more than 70 such centers, and California has about 40. In contrast, New York State has just three: the Birthing Center of Buffalo, the Brooklyn Birthing Center and the Birthing Center of New York.\\r\\nOne reason that New York lags behind other states is that midwives here cannot operate birthing centers on their own, and are required to have a physician in charge. In November 2016, state legislation was passed to change this, but two years on, the Department of Health is still drafting the regulations necessary to implement the new law. Until then, the status quo remains.\\r\\n\u201cBirthing centers in New York have to be supervised by an M.D., and that is a huge barrier, since the majority of birthing centers in the country are staffed just by midwives,\u201d said Kate Bauer, the executive director of the American Association of Birth Centers. \u201cThe fact that it is taking so long to write the regulations is frustrating for all involved.\u201d\\r\\nA spokesman for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo wrote in an emailed statement that the governor\u2019s office expects \u201cto advance comprehensive regulations for midwifery birth centers across New York in the coming months.\u201d\\r\\nLegislation aside, the real reason, like so much else in the city, seems to point to money. Birthing centers have all the liability of traditional maternity wards, but bring in a fraction of the billable costs.\\r\\n\u201cOurs is a system that rewards doing more and penalizes letting nature take its course,\u201d said Nan Strauss, the director of policy and advocacy at the nonprofit Every Mother Counts.\\r\\nBeginning next year, after Mount Sinai closes its center, just three natural birth facilities will serve a city of more than eight million people. This includes two rooms at the NewYork-Presbyterian Lower Manhattan Hospital \u2014 the city\u2019s lone remaining in-hospital facility come 2019 \u2014 as well as three rooms at the Brooklyn Birthing Center, and four rooms at the Birthing Center of New York.\\r\\nOf course, there is always the option to give birth at home. The number of home births has increased in the last decade, and there are now about 35 home-birth midwives with practices in New York City, up from just a few in the early 1990s. Still, the numbers remain relatively low, in part because of the perceived risks associated with home births, and because they can be expensive, since almost no home-birth midwives accept in-network insurance.\\r\\nWith their options limited, many women are drawn to a whisper network of mothers, doulas, midwives and supportive obstetricians to discuss alternatives for nonmedicated births. Tactics include switching from obstetricians to midwives late in pregnancy so most of the expenses will be covered by insurance; patronizing hospitals in New Jersey, where space (and alternative staffing) does not come at such a premium; and aligning with one of the city\u2019s public hospitals that has formed an unusual partnership with a midwifery practice.\\r\\nMidwives who work at birthing centers and hospitals approach pregnancy and birth as healthy life events, using medical interventions only when necessary. But a \u201chealthy life event\u201d doesn\u2019t make a hospital money; medical procedures do. This partly explains why the national cesarean section rate is now at almost 32 percent, up from less than 21 percent back in 1996. According to one study, low-risk women who aspired to deliver naturally at a birth center \u2014 even if they resorted to an epidural or other medical assistance \u2014 had a C-section rate of just six percent.\\r\\nThe natural birth movement, a reaction to \u201ctwilight sleep\u201d injections, routine episiotomies and other interventionist hospital practices, began in New York in the 1960s and took off with the opening in 1975 of the city\u2019s first birth center, the Maternity Center Association Childbearing Center on East 92nd Street, said Dr. Laura Zeidenstein, the director of the graduate midwifery program at the Columbia School of Nursing.\\r\\nBy the early 2000s, things had changed. In 2003, the Elizabeth Seton Childbearing Center in Greenwich Village, the successor to the Maternity Center, closed. That same year, NewYork-Presbyterian\u2019s Allen Hospital eliminated most of its midwifery services, and then later, the Morris Heights Childbearing Center also closed. In 2009, Bellevue closed its birthing center.\\r\\n\u201cI would say we are in a really big crisis right now, but I\u2019m hopeful that it is a crisis of opportunity,\u201d said Dr. Zeidenstein, who worked at the Maternity Center and helped found Elizabeth Seton. \u201cThings that have long been true \u2014 racial disparities, high maternal and infant mortality rates, the disrespectful treatment of women in obstetrics \u2014 are finally coming to the forefront of public awareness and hopefully action will be next.\u201d\\r\\nWhen it closes later this month, the Mount Sinai West Birthing Center will be replaced with 13 neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) beds and 15 private postpartum rooms. \u201cWe are making critically necessary expansions of our NICU and postpartum rooms to address the growing volume of sick and premature babies,\u201d the hospital said in a statement. \u201cThe decision to convert the birth center into NICU and postpartum unit was in no way driven by financial considerations, any suggestion otherwise is false.\u201d\\r\\nYet many experts insist the closure is financially motivated. Because of the way that insurance companies reimburse hospitals, the more procedures, the more revenue generated. For instance, in 2010, private insurers reimbursed hospitals, on average, almost $10,000 more for a C-section birth than for a vaginal birth, according to a study by Truven Health Analytics.\\r\\nBy closing the birthing center, Mount Sinai will be more than doubling its private postpartum rooms, for which it currently charges $900 a night, a fee that is not covered by insurance. Its new neonatal intensive care unit, while undoubtedly critical for many babies, will most likely be a major profit center for the hospital.\\r\\n\u201cIt is such a clear indication that this is the continued growth of the medical-industrial complex,\u201d said Dana-Ain Davis, the director of the Center for the Study of Women and Society at the City University of New York, of the birthing center\u2019s closure. By increasing the neonatal intensive care beds, Ms. Davis added, the focus is \u201cintervention, rather than prevention.\u201d\\r\\nRecent news that NewYork-Presbyterian will be investing in a new, state-of-the-art maternity facility \u2014 without a designated birthing center \u2014 has only intensified competition among hospitals. When it opens in 2020, the Alexandra Cohen Hospital for Women and Newborns will have 75 private postpartum rooms, up from just 22 private rooms currently, as well as 60 neonatal intensive care beds, and 16 labor and delivery rooms. The hospital also claims it will have New York City\u2019s only operating room situated within a neonatal intensive care unit.\\r\\n\u201cI really do feel strongly that women \u2014 all women \u2014 have different ideas of what they want for their birth experience, and it is our job to give that to them, whatever that is,\u201d said Dr. Laura Riley, who was recently hired to run the new hospital.\\r\\n\u201cWith this new hospital, the competition is going to be all about how much hospitals can make themselves like hotels,\u201d said Bonu deCaires, a longtime doula and educator. \u201cAre there private rooms? What is the food like? How plush is it? But what really matters is the care that you receive, not the thread count.\u201d\\r\\nWhile competition is tough among hospitals, it has become dire for midwives. In recent years, a combination of high malpractice insurance costs and low reimbursement rates has forced several midwifery practices to close.\\r\\n\u201cMidwifery is very hands-on and time-intensive,\u201d said Dr. Zeidenstein of Columbia, who was also a midwife at Midwifery of Manhattan, a private practice that, despite having a patient waiting list, closed last year. \u201cMidwives utilize technology judiciously. The cost is human time and that just can\u2019t be billed for.\u201d\\r\\nDoulas, or birthing coaches, are also struggling to make ends meet. But their services aren\u2019t covered by insurance, limiting the number of women who can hire them. The New York State Department of Health, in looking to remedy this, is considering measures for Medicaid to cover doulas, although the proposal is not yet finalized.\\r\\n\u201cIt is about birth justice and body autonomy,\u201d said Chanel L. Porchia-Albert, the founder of Ancient Song Doula Services, which provides free and low-cost care. \u201cWhat happens sometimes for women of color is that we are criminalized for the choices we make,\u201d she said. \u201cIf a woman comes in and says I don\u2019t want this medical intervention, they will call child protective services because they consider it medical neglect, or if you don\u2019t want to have a C-section and want a natural birth, they will ignore your wishes or even refuse basic medical care.\u201d\\r\\nIt was these concerns that drove Marsha Willock, a nurse from Canarsie, Brooklyn, who is black, to hire a doula. \u201cI really want to survive this, and the maternity mortality rate really shook me up,\u201d said Ms. Willock, who was referring to the fact that in New York City, non-Hispanic black woman are 12 times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than non-Hispanic white women. \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t be dying,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially for something that is supposed to be natural.\u201d\\r\\nAt Lower Manhattan Hospital, the situation is similar to that of Mount Sinai West. Rooms are often inaccessible or closed, and disgruntled midwives have quit. Ms. deCaires, for instance, recently attended a birth with a mother who was told when she arrived that the birthing center was full; the mother would have to give birth in a regular labor and delivery room. Yet when she settled into her room, it turned out to be a birthing center room, with with a tub and other accoutrements. The mother was prohibited from making use of these things; she ended up with an epidural.\\r\\n\u201cThe Birth Center at NewYork-Presbyterian Lower Manhattan Hospital has two fully operational rooms,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cOne of the Birth Center rooms can also accommodate all labor and delivery patients.\u201d\\r\\nJennifer Adair decided to leave the city to have her baby. \u201cI loved my obstetrician, but as I got into my third trimester, there was a lot more talk about medical interventions,\u201d said Ms. Adair, an assistant professor at Fairfield University who lives in Inwood. At 31 weeks, she switched to a midwife, but since she was so far along, her options were limited. A doula suggested that she consider giving birth in New Jersey.\\r\\n\u201cI found the level of care there was exactly what I wanted,\u201d said Ms. Adair, who delivered at Pascack Valley Medical Center in Westwood, a short drive over the George Washington Bridge. The hospital doesn\u2019t have a separate birthing center, but it does offer midwifery care, and Ms. Adair gave birth without medical interventions. \u201cMy insurance was accepted, and unlike the hospitals I saw in New York, you were guaranteed a private postpartum room at no extra charge.\u201d\\r\\nFor those who would like to stay in the city, there is, perhaps, a new option. Two years ago, Jamee Gidwitz planned to give birth at Mount Sinai East on Fifth Avenue. But after touring the hospital, she said, she grew fearful that the staff there wouldn\u2019t support her choices. When she told her doctors at Village Obstetrics, who are affiliated with Mount Sinai East, they suggested that she be the first of their patients to try a new model of care they were offering.\\r\\nThe doctors, George Mussalli and Jaqueline Worth, were opening Village Maternity, a private midwifery practice. It was to be a separate business from Village Obstetrics. Dr. Mussalli and Dr. Worth would continue delivering babies at Mount Sinai East, but Village Maternity midwives would deliver babies at Metropolitan Hospital, a public hospital in East Harlem.\\r\\nLocated on First Avenue and 97th Street, Metropolitan is a part of New York City\u2019s Health and Hospitals Corporation. The majority of its patients are part of its pre- and postnatal clinic, which serves mostly lower- and middle-income women with either no insurance or public insurance.\\r\\nThere are several reasons Dr. Mussalli and Dr. Worth chose Metropolitan. The hospital has midwives on staff, and Dr. Mussalli did his residency there. Moreover, unlike most private hospitals in New York, Metropolitan offers private postpartum rooms at no extra cost.\\r\\n\u201cAs private hospitals have gotten busier, the city\u2019s hospital system hasn\u2019t enjoyed the same increase in their volume,\u201d Dr. Mussalli said. \u201cIt is a leftover reputation from the 1970s, when people wanted to avoid city hospitals. But I know firsthand that the city system has changed.\u201d\\r\\nMs. Gidwitz, a publicist who lives in the financial district, toured Metropolitan. She was impressed. \u201cThere were huge private labor and delivery rooms,\u201d she said, \u201cpostpartum rooms with en-suite bathrooms, your toddlers could come in \u2014 my partner slept in the same bed with me. I have no idea why it wasn\u2019t filled to capacity.\u201d\\r\\nBack at Mount Sinai West, the 90-member Save the Birthing Center group is holding out hope that the hospital will reverse course. It has been meeting regularly, and its petition has so far garnered more than 14,000 signatures.\\r\\nLauren Alzamora, a member of the group, has seen the benefits of her advocacy firsthand. The former dancer wrote a letter asking for confirmation from the hospital that she would not be turned away from the center when she went into labor. The letter was co-signed by more than a dozen women who are also set to deliver at the center before it closes.\\r\\nMount Sinai refused to give Ms. Alzamora any such assurances. But when she arrived, the nurses, who knew of her activism, ushered her through triage and directly to the birthing center. Her daughter Kascher was born there without medical intervention. \u201cIt was a beautiful birth,\u201d Ms. Alzamora said. \u201cA natural birth should be every woman\u2019s right.

The study, published Thursday in the journal Science, also found the arachnid mothers continue to provide the fluid, which contains about four times as much protein as cow\u2019s milk, well after their spawn had become young adults.\\r\\nThough the spiders aren\u2019t using mammary glands to produce the fluid, and hence are \u201clactating\u201d in name only, the findings should prompt scientists to reconsider what they know about nursing and how it evolved, the researchers said.\\r\\n\u201cFinding such mammal-like behavior in a spider, or in any invertebrate for that matter, was a surprise,\u201d said Richard Corlett, a conservation biologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and an author of the study. \\r\\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\\r\\nJumping spiders are the single largest group of spiders in the world, with more than 5,000 species and a presence on nearly every continent. The tiny T. magnus, also known as the black ant mimicking jumper, looks like an ant, walks like an ant and even waves its front legs in the air like a pair of antennas (it jumps when threatened or hunting). The species is found mostly in Southeast Asia.\\r\\nThe study came about after the lead author, Zhanqi Chen, also of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, noticed that young T. magnus seemed slow to leave the breeding nest, suggesting the mothers were providing some sort of extended child care. That hypothesis received a boost when he and his colleagues observed newborns in the lab and found that neither they, nor their mother, left the nest to find food for the first 20 days.\\r\\nLooking closer, they found that during the first week, the mother was depositing droplets of fluid from her underside onto the nest that the hatchlings would come and drink. After the first week, the offspring would drink the fluid directly from the mother\u2019s body.\\r\\nAdding to their surprise, the researchers found that the mother continued to provide the fluid even after her young began leaving the nest to forage at about 20 days old. The suckling finally ceased at 40 days, though the offspring still used the nest at night for another 20 days.\\r\\nThe extended nursing may be an evolutionary response to the creatures\u2019 tiny size and vulnerability.\\r\\n\u201cWe think that it may reflect the high risk of juvenile spiders becoming prey themselves if they have to hunt for their own food,\u201d said Dr. Corlett.\\r\\nIt\u2019s also unclear how the T. magnus generates the fluid, which contains 2 milligrams of sugar per milliliter of liquid, 5.2 milligrams of fat and a whopping 124 milligrams of protein. The researchers suspect it may have evolved from trophic eggs \u2014 unviable eggs that some insects produce to feed their young \u2014 because the fluid emerges from the same opening that produces eggs.\\r\\nWhen the researchers blocked the mother\u2019s ability to produce the milk by covering the opening with correction fluid (a.k.a White Out), all the hatchlings died within 11 days, showing their complete dependence on the substance.\\r\\nThough further study is needed to understand how and why the T. magnus generates the fluid, the study should further challenge the assumption that lactation is a uniquely mammalian trait, said Dr. Corlett. \u201cOur findings suggest that \u2018lactation\u2019 may arise in non-mammals when it provides a significant advantage in offspring survival.\u201d\\r\\n\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1868053901,\"description\":\"The jumping arachnids\u2019 secretions have four times as much protein as cow milk.\\r\",\"title\":\"Trilobites: Meet the Spiders That Feed Milk to Their Young\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.6.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"One of the titans of 20th-century physics, Richard Feynman deciphered the interplay of fundamental particles and forces.

While brilliant, he was not perfect. That becomes evident looking at some of his papers that go up for auction on Friday.\\r\\nFeynman received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 for key insights in understanding the quantum version of electromagnetism, and the medal and citation that came with it is the centerpiece of the auction, conducted by Sotheby\u2019s in New York.

That made it challenging to organize the papers as sometimes he continued his thought on a different colored piece of paper with a different pen.\\r\\nThe written scribble on this sheet include the \u201cFeynman diagrams\u201d that he developed to quickly summarize a subatomic interaction with lines and squiggles.\\r\\nA few of Feynman\u2019s sketches are interspersed among his notes. \\r\\nIncluded in the auction are books from Feynman\u2019s library, including a textbook written by Paul Dirac, another giant of 20th-century physics. Feynman wrote comments in the margins. \u201cAnalyze this some day,\u201d he wrote on one page. \\r\\nIn recent years, Feynman\u2019s reputation as a womanizer has led some critics to re-evaluate his academic legacy. Some of his behavior, like dating undergraduates, would likely be grounds for academic sanction today.\\r\\nIncluded in the random pieces of paper at auction is an example of some of this behavior: place mats from Gianonni\u2019s, a strip club in Pasadena, Calif., not far from his home, where Feynman often went. While there, he would scribble on the backs of the place mats.\\r\\nFor the mathematical notations on this particular place mat, \u201cWe couldn't tie it to any specific problem,\u201d Ms. Hatton said. \u201cIt seems almost like he was just playing around.\u201d\\r\\nIn his book \u201cSurely You\u2019re Joking, Mr. Feynman,\u201d he recalled, \u201cI\u2019d sit in one of the booths and work a little physics on the paper place mats with the scalloped edges, and sometimes I\u2019d draw one of the dancing girls or one of the customers, just to practice.\u201d\\r\\nOne of Feynman\u2019s most famous talks was \u201cThere\u2019s Plenty of Room at the Bottom\u201d in 1959, which predicted the advent of nanotechnology, creating machines at the scale of molecules. This document, above, was found among the papers that the family had. It appears to have been prepared for a version of the talk given at El Camino College in California. \\r\\nFeynman was also well known as a lecturer, striving to find the clearest way to explain a difficult concept. \\r\\nOn March 13, 1964, he gave a talk in a freshman physics class at Caltech about the motion of planets. An archivist found a transcript of the lecture, once believed lost, and it was turned into a book, \u201cFeynman's Lost Lecture: The Motion of Planets Around the Sun.\u201d In sifting through the papers that the family possessed, \u201cWhat we found is a much more extensive version of that lost lecture,\u201d Ms. Hatton said.\\r\\nOutside of physics, Feynman did magic and played bongo drums. This is a tambourine that Feynman bought in Brazil. He taught himself Portuguese and how to play the tambourine in a samba band.\\r\\nThe Nobel medal is 23-karat gold. (Since 1980, they are now 18-karat gold plated with 24-karat gold.)\\r\\nFeynman was not happy about the 4 a.m. phone call that he had won a Nobel. He complained about being woken up and hung up. He later recounted in \u201cSurely You\u2019re Joking\u201d:\\r\\nThen I began to think, \u2018How can I turn this all off? I don\u2019t want any of this!\u2019 So the first thing was to take the telephone off the hook\u2026. I went down to the study to think: What am I going to do? Maybe I won\u2019t accept the Prize. What would happen then? Maybe that\u2019s impossible\u2026.\u201d\\r\\nFeynman did go to Stockholm to accept the prize. During the ceremony, he doodled in one of the booklets.\\r\\n\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-2031516895,\"description\":\"The scribblings of a brilliant 20th-century physicist show that he did not get everything right on the first try, either.\\r\",\"title\":\"Rough Drafts of Richard Feynman\u2019s Ideas Head to Auction\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.7.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"(Want to get this briefing by email?

We\u2019d also like to wish a happy Hanukkah to all who celebrate. Last, please let us know what you think about our new format.\\r\\n\\r\\nA temporary truce in the trade war\\r\\nAn agreement this weekend between President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China will give the two leaders some political breathing room as their trade dispute begins to take a toll.\\r\\nMr. Trump agreed to hold off on imposing additional tariffs on Chinese goods, and Mr. Xi pledged to import more American products. But the deal, reached at the Group of 20 meeting in Argentina, does little to resolve the deep differences between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\\r\\nReaction: Stocks opened higher on Wall Street this morning, and markets in Asia and Europe also rose. \\r\\nRelated: Mr. Trump also announced his intention to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement. The move is intended to force House Democrats to approve a revised version of the pact, despite concerns that it fails to protect American workers.\\r\\n\\r\\nRemembering the life of George Bush\\r\\nThe former president will lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda in Washington beginning this afternoon, and a state funeral will be held at the National Cathedral on Wednesday. Mr. Bush will be laid to rest on the grounds of his presidential library at Texas A&M University.\\r\\nObituary: Mr. Bush, the 41st president and the father of the 43rd, died Friday at his home in Houston. He was 94.\\r\\nLooking back: Mr. Bush led the country through the end of the Cold War and the beginning of its long entanglement in Iraq. Read more about Mr. Bush\u2019s legacy.\\r\\nThe Daily: Today\u2019s episode is about Mr. Bush and why he didn\u2019t get a second term.\\r\\nIn Congress: Washington had been planning to work this week to avert a partial government shutdown. Lawmakers are now considering a one- or two-week spending bill to set aside negotiations until after Mr. Bush\u2019s funeral.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench government plans to meet with protesters\\r\\nPresident Emmanuel Macron returned from the Group of 20 summit meeting to a country in turmoil after a third weekend of nationwide protests by the \u201cYellow Vests\u201d movement, which began in response to rising gas taxes.\\r\\nHe ordered Prime Minister \u00c9douard Philippe to meet with representatives of the movement starting today. The Yellow Vests take their name from the high-visibility safety vests that motorists carry.\\r\\nBackground: The protests have largely focused on Paris, but they are rooted in rural France, where ordinary workers are angry about economic inequality.\\r\\nWatch: Video of the violence this weekend in Paris.\\r\\n\\r\\nWashington hopes to open up drilling in Alaska\\r\\nThe Trump administration, working with Republicans in Congress and an influential Alaska Native corporation, is quickly clearing the way for oil exploration in the federally protected Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\\r\\nThe biggest untapped onshore trove of oil in North America is believed to lie beneath the refuge\u2019s coastal plain. The Times examined how, in the space of about a year, the area went from off limits to open for business. Here are six takeaways from our report.\\r\\nThe impact: Actual oil production is at least a decade away, but the turnaround is a breakthrough in the administration\u2019s campaign to ease environmental policies.\\r\\nHow we know: This article is based on interviews with more than three dozen people and a review of internal government deliberations and federal documents. \\r\\n\\r\\nHousing migrant children \u2014 and profiting \\r\\nSouthwest Key Programs now houses more migrant children than any other organization in the nation. A charity on paper, it has collected $1.7 billion in federal grants in the past decade, including $626 million in the past year. \\r\\nBut it has left a record of sloppy management and possible financial improprieties, according to dozens of interviews and an examination of documents. And no one has benefited more than Juan Sanchez, the 71-year-old Texan who founded it. \\r\\nQatar to withdraw from OPEC: The tiny, wealthy country announced today that it would leave the global oil cartel in January, a move that will allow it to increase production. The energy minister said the decision wasn\u2019t related to a Saudi-led boycott on Qatar.\\r\\nNew trouble for Israeli leader: The police recommended that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu be indicted on bribery, fraud and other charges. It is the third time this year they have made such a recommendation.\\r\\nGoogle on Capitol Hill: The company\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, is to testify on Wednesday in Congress, where he\u2019s likely to hear accusations that his company suppresses conservative-leaning news. It\u2019s one of the business headlines to watch. \\r\\n #MeToo accusations for Neil deGrasse Tyson: The astrophysicist denied allegations of sexual misconduct by three women. Broadcasters of his show \u201cCosmos\u201d said they would investigate. \\r\\nSnapshot: Above, a family exploring earthquake damage in Wasilla, Alaska. The marvel of the magnitude 7 quake that jolted Anchorage on Friday is that it didn\u2019t cause more destruction. \\r\\nCollege football playoffs: The semifinal matchups on Dec. 29 are set: Clemson will play Notre Dame at the Cotton Bowl, and Alabama will play Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl. \\r\\nGood news: A couple from England got engaged in New York this weekend, then the ring fell through a grate in Times Square. The police came to the rescue. \\r\\nWhat we\u2019re reading: This brief but pointed essay from BuzzFeed News. Andrea Kannapell, our briefings editor, observes: \u201cReporters who write about, or carefully monitor, news of the Mueller investigation appear to be the biggest fans of this look at how it\u2019s playing out on Twitter \u2014 as \u2018the biggest internet fandom there\u2019s ever been.\u2019\u201d \\r\\nCook: Serve a comforting stew of spiced chickpeas crisped in olive oil, then simmered in a garlicky coconut milk. \\r\\nRead: In the throes of the#MeToo movement, Manohla Dargis re-examined what she learned \u2014 and had to unlearn \u2014 from the big screen.\\r\\nWatch: \u201cHappy as Lazzaro,\u201d which A.

Peacocks strut around its surrounding manicured gardens. Intricately carved pillars hold up its dome.\\r\\nBut perhaps most remarkable is its noble origin story. It is said that the palace was built as a mass relief program, employing thousands of local residents when the city was hit by a crippling drought.\\r\\nAfter the Indian government ceased to recognize Indian royalty in 1971, the palace was split into three parts: the royal residence where Mr. Singh\u2019s grandson now lives, a luxury hotel and a museum.\\r\\nThat\u2019s it for this briefing.\\r\\nAre you a fan of our Back Stories?

Same goes for the big group text message and that one relative who floods our phones with multiple consecutive texts to convey a single thought. (You know who you are.)\\r\\nAnd here we thought technology was supposed to make our lives more efficient. \\r\\nFret not. I share your pain and so tested various tools to help people get together and stay connected this holiday. Here were the best ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Making Plans\\r\\nLet\u2019s start with the most frustrating situation: getting a big group of people to agree on when and where to meet. There are plenty of approaches, like sharing calendars or sending lots of emails, but the simplest solution I\u2019ve found is creating a poll.\\r\\nDoodlePoll, or doodle.com, is a free web tool made just for this purpose. First, you create a poll and give it a title, like \u201cWatch the Fantastic Beasts movie.\u201d In the following steps, you can select multiple potential times and dates, such as 7 p.m. on Dec. 23, 3 p.m. on Dec. 25 and 4 p.m. on Dec. 26.\\r\\nAfter you make your selections, you punch in your name and get a web link that people can click on to view the options, cast their votes and type in their name. From there, you can choose the time slot that got the most votes, close the poll and then communicate the plan to the group. I\u2019ve used this tool for groups big and small, and it spares me dozens of notifications and messages before meeting up.\\r\\nFor a Group Chat\\r\\nWhen it comes to staying in touch or catching up over the holidays, using a group text message is fine if everyone is using an iPhone. That\u2019s because Apple\u2019s default texting service, iMessage, gives you the option to leave the conversation when it becomes too distracting. \\r\\nBut if there are Android users among the group, the chat bubbles turn from blue to green, meaning that the messages are being sent as traditional text messages. Unfortunately, with traditional texting you can\u2019t exit a group chat, and the only option is to turn off alerts for the entire conversation.\\r\\nIt\u2019s a better idea to start a group conversation with a messaging app that works for both Apple and Android devices. WhatsApp, Signal and Facebook Messenger are all good options: Each offers the ability to leave a group conversation. My favorite is WhatsApp because it tends to be the app that most people already have installed; it also lets you share your location to make it easier for people to find you.\\r\\nSome families or friends will want some face-to-face interaction from afar. The popular tools are video-chatting apps like Apple\u2019s FaceTime for iPhone users or Google Hangouts for Android or iPhone. Hangouts has supported group video chats for years, and FaceTime added the option just last month to make a group call with up to 32 people.\\r\\nFor Sharing Photos\\r\\nThen there\u2019s the annual exchange of photos during the holidays. You could just send a dozen photos of your trip to Europe or your newborn in a group text message, but that would burn through everyone\u2019s cellular data plans and make you unpopular.\\r\\nThere are better solutions (as I detailed in a guide last year). Google Photos is an excellent app for both Android devices and iPhones. Whenever you take a photo, Google Photos backs it up in the cloud, which makes it easier to share with others who have Google accounts. It also has neat tools to automatically organize photos into albums \u2014 for example, the app can use location data to create an album for your vacation in Spain.\\r\\nFor families that exclusively use iPhones, AirDrop is a good option to share photos among devices easily. When you are next to a relative, you can select a photo or a group of photos on your iPhone and tap the Share button (a box with an arrow pointing up). Your relative\u2019s device will show up under the AirDrop menu, and you can select the device. The files will move over instantly \u2014 even a batch of 50 photos will take less than a minute.\\r\\nThese methods aren't completely hassle-free, of course. Some of them require goading less tech-savvy friends and relatives into trying new tools. But once they are persuaded, your holiday gatherings will be less vexing to create, organize and reminisce about for years to come.\\r\\n\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1700442969,\"description\":\"Getting a big group together this time of year can be a hassle.

Read more of this series here. \\r\\nThis month The New York Times won a libel suit brought by an Ohio State professor over this investigative story. Here, David McCraw, deputy general counsel at The Times, talks about the paper\u2019s history of handling libel claims.\\r\\nThe undertaker was drunk.\\r\\nAt least that is what The New York Times said. The year was 1886, and The Times was reporting on a simmering public dispute between the family of Ulysses S. Grant and an undertaker from Saratoga Springs, N.Y., who showed up, apparently sauced, to take charge of the former president\u2019s body on July 23, 1885. Not surprisingly, the Grant family declined to pay his bill (an \u201cexorbitant and unjust\u201d $500), and the whole sorry episode became the subject of a Times article. \\r\\nThat was when the undertaker, one Ebenezer Holmes, sued The Times for libel, joining the long parade of unhappy people who have lodged libel complaints against The Times over the course of the paper\u2019s 167-year history.\\r\\nWhile the Holmes case long ago faded into oblivion, it still captures the essence of a libel claim: A person dissatisfied with his portrayal in the paper comes to court to make the case that the article was false, his reputation has been harmed and only an award of damages can set things right.\\r\\nMuch has changed about libel in the 130 years since undertaker Holmes undertook to sue The Times. For one thing, libel litigation has become relatively rare, at least for The Times. For example, between 2010 and 2017, The Times had 11 libel suits, all but one of them filed in the United States. The plaintiffs have ranged from college professors and a coal industry magnate to a junior high principal, a onetime candidate for vice president and an F.B.I. informant. The one case filed abroad was brought in Moscow by a close Putin chum. No surprise how that one turned out: We lost.\\r\\nThe Times has fared slightly better in the United States: The newspaper has not lost a libel case brought over one of its articles for at least 50 years. Much of the legal credit for that goes to a Times court decision that has not been forgotten: Times v. Sullivan, the 1964 Supreme Court opinion that revolutionized the law of libel. \\r\\nSullivan was a 9-0 smackdown of plaintiffs who saw libel suits as a legal extortion racket to be used to silence publishers. L.B. Sullivan, the plaintiff, was a police commissioner in Montgomery, Ala. He sued The Times over an ad from supporters of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who had bought space in the paper to protest the violence being visited upon civil rights demonstrators in the South \u2014 in particular, the police misconduct during a protest in Montgomery. \\r\\nSullivan claimed that the ad had besmirched his good name (even though he wasn\u2019t mentioned) and persuaded an Alabama jury to hit The New York Times with a $500,000 verdict. It was one of dozens of libel suits being used by Southern power brokers to try to silence the press.\\r\\nBy the time the case reached the Supreme Court, the justices had seen enough. \u201cThis technique for harassing and punishing a free press \u2014 now that it has been shown to be possible \u2014 is by no means limited to cases with racial overtones; it can be used in other fields where public feelings may make local as well as out-of-state newspapers easy prey for libel verdict seekers,\u201d one of the justices wrote. \\r\\nThe court famously held that public officials, and later all public figures, would need to show not just that an article was inaccurate and hurt their reputation, but also that the publisher acted with \u201cactual malice\u201d \u2014 with reckless disregard for the truth. It is a demanding standard, effectively requiring plaintiffs to show that editors knew a story was false, or had serious doubts about its accuracy, and published it anyway.\\r\\nSullivan led to a series of other court decisions that curtailed the ability of libel plaintiffs to win their lawsuits. None of it was intended to be a balancing. It was an imbalancing, a conscious decision by the courts to free journalists to pursue the truth without fear of triggering a lawsuit that could bankrupt their publisher. The Sullivan decision, like the First Amendment itself, was anchored in the belief that competing voices rather than lawsuits were the best way to get at the truth. The Times has long believed that as well. Its policy of not paying money to plaintiffs to settle libel suits in the United States against the newspaper traces back to a 1922 letter written by the publisher.\\r\\nAs powerful as Sullivan has been in curbing libel suits, it doesn\u2019t really change the way newspaper lawyers go about their jobs. We still want to know whether the undertaker was really drunk and how our reporters came to know that. No lawyer here has ever reviewed a story draft, concluded it was a factual wreck and then declared it was good to go because the reporter didn\u2019t have a reckless disregard for the truth. Whatever the Supreme Court may have said in Sullivan, getting it right is still what matters.\\r\\nAt The Times, Legal is asked every day to review articles and videos in advance of publication. Over time, trends emerge. We will almost always be focused on a story\u2019s minor players, who tend to be the people most likely to sue. They are often unhappy to be in an article about someone else\u2019s misconduct, have grievances about context or feel they should have been given more of a say. We spend lots of time considering the line between opinion (which is legally protected) and fact (which can give rise to a libel suit). And nothing more bedevils lawyers and editors than claims for \u201clibel by implication\u201d \u2014 when the facts may be right but a plaintiff says that the story implied something defamatory. \\r\\nUndertaker Holmes\u2019s case involved no such legal subtleties. At trial, The Times tried to prove he was drunk. That didn\u2019t work out so well. Holmes won a $3,500 verdict. The Times soldiered on and finally got the verdict set aside on appeal \u2014 after nine years of litigating. Then as now, the decision makers at The Times thought the journalism was worth defending.\\r\\nA note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.\\r\\nFollow the @ReaderCenter on Twitter for more coverage highlighting your perspectives and experiences and for insight into how we work. \\r\\nDavid McCraw is vice president and deputy general counsel of The New York Times.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-223316633,\"description\":\"In Times v.

The Workologist is a guy with well-intentioned opinions, not a professional career adviser. Letters may be edited.\\r\\nI hired, trained, and mentored an entry-level professional who, after two years, earned a promotion doing similar work in another department. In the year since she took that job, we have been in frequent email contact, have worked together on projects occasionally and have seen each other at meetings once or twice a month.\\r\\nShe is clearly succeeding, but I have seen and heard one or two things (including one criticism from her direct supervisor) that make me believe some more structured and deliberate mentoring could help her. We are both very busy, so making time to talk over coffee hasn\u2019t really worked. And I think part of her career strategy at this point is to establish an identity independent of my influence.\\r\\nThis was my first prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, and I\u2019m proud of the progress she has made. I would like to see her stay on track to move up, and I know there will be openings. But I don\u2019t know what role, if any, I should play in that.\\r\\nShould I suggest some sort of regular meeting (maybe quarterly) for mentoring? Or is it not my place to suggest that to someone who hasn\u2019t asked for it?\\r\\nANONYMOUS\\r\\nYou sound like a thoughtful mentor. And you\u2019re smart to recognize the importance of one of the trickiest questions in the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship: Should I let go?\\r\\nOne way or another, it\u2019s important that at some point this person feels that her professional identity is hers, and not just some reflected-glory side effect of her association with you. (Even if that was never really the case, what matters at this stage is how the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 feels about the relationship.)\\r\\nGiven that you already detect a desire for independence, I\u2019d say suggesting quarterly meetings is the wrong way to go: It might seem too much like a gambit to assert some kind of permanent influence over her career.\\r\\nInstead, suggest one meeting, and go into it with a mind-set that you are in effect turning over control of this relationship to her. In other words, don\u2019t think about it in terms of what you\u2019re obligated to say or do. Think about it terms of what she wants from you, or doesn\u2019t.\\r\\nBe straightforward: \u201cYou\u2019re doing great, and you probably don\u2019t need my help anymore. Still, we all need input from time to time, so I just want to say I\u2019m a resource if you need me, but I want that to be up to you.\u201d \\r\\nI\u2019m not sure how candid you can be about the criticism you\u2019ve heard, but if it\u2019s possible you might also share that. Just try to frame it productively: not \u201cI hear complaints about X\u201d but rather \u201cFrom what I hear you might benefit from trying Y.\u201d\\r\\nIn other words, communicate that this is about her, not you. You\u2019re on her side, and you\u2019ll be there if she needs you, whether that\u2019s tomorrow or years from now. And most important: If you say this, make sure you mean it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Boss Is Addicted to His Phone\\r\\nMy boss is a very nice guy, and I enjoy working for him, with one exception.\\r\\nWe\u2019re a very small company, so he doesn\u2019t have an assistant to screen his calls. As a result \u2014 and here\u2019s the problem \u2014 he keeps his cellphone in view at all times. It\u2019s virtually impossible to get through a meeting without at least one call or text interruption. Even when he doesn\u2019t answer, he pauses to look and decide whether whatever he\u2019s receiving can wait.\\r\\nI\u2019m left wondering whether I should continue to talk, or pause until he looks up. Often, I have to reiterate the point I was making when the phone broke his concentration.\\r\\nSome of these interruptions are work related, some are personal. He is dedicated to his family, and I appreciate that about him. Still, this behavior seems unprofessional at best and just plain bad for business at worst. Is there anything I can do without coming across as an unsympathetic malcontent?\\r\\nNEW YORK\\r\\nYour boss sounds familiar. Far too many people don\u2019t get that observing basic social mores also happens to be good for keeping a business functioning smoothly. Generally speaking, there is very little in this life that can\u2019t wait an hour.\\r\\nHere\u2019s one strategy that might send the message. If you\u2019re speaking to someone who looks away to check his phone, stop talking immediately. Don\u2019t be theatrical about it, but through your behavior make it clear that you are not going to communicate information to somebody who is taking in other, totally unrelated information.\\r\\nThis doesn\u2019t have to be hostile.

Everything O.K.?\u201d\\r\\nYes, this might seem passive-aggressive. But you can\u2019t order your boss to put his phone on airplane mode.

I threw up.\u201d\\r\\nThe phrase is uttered so innocently, but it incites in me an immediate dark panic. I know right then \u2014 which way too often is in the middle of the night \u2014 that my vomiting child probably has a stomach virus, and that our family has just begun another weeklong round of ring-around-the-toilet. First it\u2019ll be my son, then my daughter, then me, then my husband. My symptoms, for some reason, are the worst. The first time my husband saw me with a stomach bug, he said, \u201cI really thought you were going to die.\u201d\\r\\nSo which stomach bug is responsible? Salmonella? The flu? No, it\u2019s probably norovirus, which causes the vast majority of stomach bugs in the United States. Research suggests that noroviruses can survive on surfaces for as long as 42 days, and it takes only about 20 viral particles to make a person sick. Yet one tablespoon of vomit contains a whopping 15 million viruses, and the same amount of stool contains up to 75 billion of the buggers. So \u201cif it does spread in your house, it\u2019s not your fault,\u201d said Eli Perencevich, a physician and epidemiologist at the University of Iowa. (Small consolation, though, if you\u2019re puking everywhere.)\\r\\nNow that we\u2019re again approaching winter \u2014 a.k.a., norovirus season \u2014 I\u2019ve decided to arm myself against stomach bugs with science, and you should, too. Here\u2019s how.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeep your hands and the bathroom clean\\r\\nWhen someone in your household gets sick, everyone in the family needs to wash their hands frequently with soap. Focus on scrubbing fingertips and nailbeds, where viruses linger. Hand sanitizers, sadly, aren\u2019t effective.\\r\\nIf you can, quarantine the sick. Keep them home, of course, and ideally in one part of the house. If you\u2019re fortunate enough to have a home with multiple bathrooms, designate one as the \u201csick\u201d one that healthy family members don\u2019t use.\\r\\nIf that\u2019s not possible, or if everyone has to share a bathroom, \u201cI would not call it overkill to clean surfaces every time\u201d a sick person uses the toilet, said Mary Wikswo, viral epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\r\\nThis means cleaning the toilet, the handle, the sink, the doorknob \u2014 anything that a sick person or his or her fluids might have touched. Close the toilet lid before every flush, too, and maybe even flush a second time after pouring in a half cup to a cup of bleach.\\r\\nCleaning wipes don\u2019t work. Get the right gear.\\r\\nA little-known fact about noroviruses is that many household cleaners and wipes don\u2019t kill them. Clorox and Lysol Disinfecting wipes claim to kill 99.9 percent of viruses and bacteria, but that doesn\u2019t include noroviruses. Your best bet is to wipe down surfaces with a bleach solution \u2014 mix between a half cup and cup of bleach with a gallon of water \u2014 or to use health-care-grade bleach wipes, such as Clorox Healthcare Bleach Germicidal Wipes, which are hard to find in stores but are sold on websites like Amazon. Let the bleach sit on the surface for at least five minutes, ideally 10, because it takes time to kill these resilient jerks. Hydrogen peroxide cleaners are another effective option.\\r\\nIf a family member doesn\u2019t make it to the toilet in time, you\u2019ll have to clean up even more carefully. Angela Fraser, a researcher at Clemson University who studies vomit and fecal cleanup strategies (seriously!), suggests that you wear disposable gloves and goggles. Dr. Perencevich said a face mask is good, too, because it keeps you from touching your mouth. In any case, \u201creally concentrate on not touching your face while you\u2019re doing all this,\u201d he says.\\r\\nTo keep the viruses from becoming airborne as you clean, cover the fluid with paper towels, or shake kitty litter or sawdust on it, before scooping it all into a plastic bag. Then close it with a twist tie and dispose of it. Scrub the area with soap and water and then disinfect it with one of the cleaners mentioned above.\\r\\nAlso, don\u2019t just clean where you saw the fluid. Dr. Fraser recommends sanitizing a 25-foot radius, including walls, table legs and any other surfaces that might have been inadvertently sprinkled with virus. (The good news is that by the time you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll have reached your 30 minutes of exercise for the day.)\\r\\nIf you have to disinfect a rug or upholstered furniture, you probably can\u2019t use bleach because it will cause color damage. If you have a steam cleaner, use it for five minutes at 170 degrees Fahrenheit, Dr. Fraser said. Dr. Perencevich said that another option is to spray it with a hydrogen peroxide cleaner after testing that it won\u2019t cause damage.\\r\\nIf clothes or washable linens get soiled, either wash them in a washing machine on the \u201chot\u201d or \u201csanitize\u201d setting (ideally with a half cup of bleach, if bleaching won\u2019t damage them) or put them in a plastic bag and quarantine them for a few days or weeks, because every time you handle soiled clothes, you risk spreading the virus, Dr. Perencevich said. Consider also designating specific plates, utensils and cups for sick family members, because some dishwashers don\u2019t eliminate all noroviruses. And don\u2019t let anyone who\u2019s sick prepare food for anyone else.\\r\\nStick to science, and do what you can\\r\\nSpeaking of things that don\u2019t kill noroviruses: Drinking grape juice or apple cider vinegar won\u2019t keep you healthy, despite what friends may have told you. (I know, I really wanted to believe it, too.) These \u201ccures\u201d supposedly work because they change the pH of the stomach, making it too acidic for noroviruses to grow. But \u201cnorovirus grows in the small intestine, so changing the stomach environment is really not going to do you much good,\u201d Dr. Wikswo said.\\r\\nIf this all sounds overwhelming, I hear you. Do what you can. And there is good news: Some people are naturally more resistant to noroviruses because of genetic mutations that affect sugars found on cell surfaces. People with B or AB blood types are more resistant, too. (Of course, I\u2019m type O.) And most of the time, noroviruses are more unpleasant than they are dangerous. Maybe \u201cunpleasant\u201d is too generous a word, but the other words I\u2019m thinking of aren\u2019t fit for print. I\u2019ll be yelling them into my toilet the next time I get sick, though, that\u2019s for sure.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1443018195,\"description\":\"It can survive on surfaces for days, is tricky to kill, and is the source of most stomach bugs in America.

You could use a smartphone to call up a car as if you were some kind of baller. You could video-chat with people anywhere in the world, like \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d \u2014 and maybe some of those people would use the new tech to throw off the yoke of repression, somehow. They were the days of miracle and wonder. \\r\\nBut tech also felt confusing. There were so many new things \u2014 every year, new phones with so much more power, made by so many new companies, all running so many new and purportedly revolutionary apps \u2014 that it was easy to get lost in the hype. It was also easy to pick the wrong horse. There was no guarantee that this or that novelty would last until next year.\\r\\nSo to get the most out of innovations and avoid betting on the also-rans, my inaugural advice to readers was to follow these steps: Buy hardware from Apple. Use online services made by Google. And get digital media from Amazon.\\r\\nNow the time has come to amend and update that advice \u2014 which is fitting, because this will be my final column in these pages. (I\u2019m not going far: I\u2019ll be writing for The New York Times\u2019s Opinion section starting next year.)\\r\\nThe tech industry in 2018 is far more consequential than it was in 2014, when I started this job. It\u2019s bigger, more pervasive and in every way more dangerous. It is also less amenable to outside pressure: The companies that run the show are more powerful than ever, and in many cases governments \u2014 especially in the United States \u2014 have proved ineffective at curbing their excesses.\\r\\nHow should you, as an ethical and upstanding user of tech, navigate this misbegotten industry? I offer three new maxims for surviving the next era of tech. I hope you heed them; the world rides on your choices.\\r\\nDon\u2019t just look at the product. Look at the business model. \\r\\nNot long ago \u2014 in the nascent days of smartphones, mobile apps and the mysterious \u201ccloud\u201d \u2014 wading into the market for new tech was often risky. You might buy a phone or tablet whose maker would quickly go belly-up. A lot of stuff didn\u2019t work well: Backing up your data was a headache, keeping your photos organized across different devices was a nightmare. And even technologies that did work left you plagued with guilt and worry. Remember the curse of email spam, or how you had to pay through the nose for texting?\\r\\nSomething strange and unexpected has happened in the last five years: A lot of tech got pretty good. Slowly but surely, many of our basic struggles were fixed. Nothing is perfect, but for most people, the mobile era has brought simplicity to tech for the first time.\\r\\nBut ubiquitous quality has given rise to a new problem: If everything just works, how are you supposed to choose what to buy?\\r\\nMy advice: Don\u2019t just consider how well a product works, but look at who\u2019s making it and how it is sold. Before you dive into any new doodad, consider a company\u2019s ethics, morals, branding and messaging. If you aren\u2019t comfortable, look to alternatives. (Last year, for instance, I switched to Lyft from Uber, and I\u2019ve never looked back.) Most important, when you\u2019re choosing tech, it\u2019s wise to consider the business model \u2014 because it\u2019s in the buying and the selling of a product, rather than in the using, that you can best figure out its dangers.\\r\\nFor instance: Even though Google\u2019s Pixel line of phones is very good \u2014 a far more affordable option with some features that iPhone users might kill for \u2014 I stick with Apple\u2019s phones because I appreciate the simplicity of the trade. I pay Apple a huge sum of money for the device, and it takes extraordinary care in protecting me from some of the worst digital scourges.\\r\\nI don\u2019t doubt Google\u2019s capacity to make great devices. But because Google makes most of its money from ads, and because the internet ad business lies at the heart of just about every terrible thing online, I\u2019d rather not fall deeper into that swamp.\\r\\nSimilarly, I found Facebook\u2019s new video-chatting machine, Portal, to be very good, but I\u2019ll never buy it. Besides Facebook\u2019s dependence on targeted ads, the company has repeatedly breached its users\u2019 trust, not to mention the casual disregard it has shown for larger ideas like democracy. Portal is nice, but it\u2019s not that nice.\\r\\nAvoid feeding the giants.\\r\\nOne thing that hasn\u2019t changed in the last five years is who\u2019s running the show. When I started writing this column, Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft were tech\u2019s biggest and most influential companies. Today, even with recent stock-market troubles, the same five giants sit at the top of the world.\\r\\nI\u2019ve railed against this sort of concentration again and again \u2014 the tech giants\u2019 increasing domination ruins innovation, undermines consumer choice and generally makes a lot of the industry ungovernable. Lawmakers around the world are now taking notice, and it\u2019s possible that in the next five years, we\u2019ll see greater regulatory curbs to the behemoths\u2019 size and scope.\\r\\nBut you don\u2019t have to wait for politicians to weigh in. Your choices as a consumer matter, too \u2014 and for a better, healthier tech industry, it\u2019s best to avoid mindlessly feeding the giants whenever you can. If you have a choice between something made by one of the Big Five and some indie brand, choose the indie.\\r\\nHere\u2019s one example: Even though I like Apple\u2019s hardware and appreciate its business model, I\u2019ve stayed away from Apple Music, its subscription streaming service. For me, Spotify is superior in just about every way. Its app works better (its music recommendation algorithm is eerily good), it releases innovative features at a faster clip, and its songs play on more types of devices.\\r\\nBest of all, Spotify is an independent company. So when I pay for it, I am, in a small way, spreading the wealth in the industry. \\r\\nThere are some downsides to this. Apple has shamelessly given its own service priority on its devices \u2014 so Siri, for example, will play music from Apple\u2019s service but not from Spotify. But it\u2019s precisely this sort of mischief that I\u2019m hoping to dissuade by putting my money elsewhere.\\r\\nThere are lots of other examples for looking beyond the big guys. You can use Dropbox instead of storing all your stuff with Apple and Google. Rather than Microsoft Word or Google Docs, I write in Ulysses, a lightweight composing app that is faster and more elegant than any big-tech competitor. Whatever tech you\u2019re in the market for, there\u2019s most likely some innovative thing made by a non-giant that deserves consideration, if not your money.\\r\\nAdopt late. Slow down. \\r\\nOne reason the tech industry feels as terrible as it now does is that many of us failed to appreciate the collective power of our choices. Ten years ago, smartphones looked like fun gadgets and social media seemed like a harmless pastime \u2014 and few saw the implications for society in their ubiquity, not least the people running the companies and making this stuff.\\r\\nThe lesson of the last decade is that our private tech choices can alter economies and societies. They matter. And they matter most in the mindless rush, when everyone seems to be jumping on board the latest new thing, because it\u2019s in these heady moments that we lose sight of the precise risks of turning ourselves over to tech.\\r\\nThat\u2019s why the most important lesson I\u2019ve gleaned in writing this column is this: Just slow down. Don\u2019t jump on the newest thing. If it isn\u2019t plagued with bugs or security nightmares, some other unexpected, emergent risk probably lies within it \u2014 and whatever its short-term benefits, you may live to regret it.\\r\\nYes, tech could make everything better. But we should be on guard for the ways it could make things worse \u2014 how self-driving cars could induce sprawl, how the \u201cinternet of things\u201d could provoke apocalypse, how social media could ruin democracy.\\r\\nAre these unlikely dangers? Maybe. But we live in unpredictable times. The unlikely happens. Be careful.

Up to one-fifth of them do not detonate, leaving large expanses of land contaminated by bomblets that kill and maim civilians years after a conflict has ceased.\\r\\nThe stigma attached to cluster munitions rose sharply with an international campaign that led to a 2008 treaty banning production, stockpiling and transfer of the weapon. The United States vigorously opposed the treaty, but 120 countries, including most NATO members, have joined the accord.\\r\\nThe organization attributed the financial drop mostly to the decision by two major American arms manufacturers \u2014 Textron Inc. and Orbital ATK \u2014 to halt production of the weapon.\\r\\nMr. Uiterwaal said those decisions at least partly reflected pressure from financial institutions that are turning their backs on funding companies that produce cluster munitions.\\r\\nThe $8.7 billion of investment tracked by PAX went to seven companies: Avibras of Brazil, Bharat Dynamics in India, the Chinese companies China Aerospace Science and Industry and Norinco, and the South Korean companies Hanwha, LigNex1 and Poongsan.\\r\\nThat list of producers is not exhaustive and no information is available on financing available to many other arms manufacturers producing cluster munitions, Mr. Uiterwaal said.\\r\\nRussia, China, India, Israel and South Korea are among states that have not joined the treaty, and the weapon has been heavily used in a number of active conflicts.

Huawei\u2019s involvement would raise \u201csignificant national security risks,\u201d Spark said Wednesday, citing a government statement.\\r\\nThe move follows a similar decision by Australia in August to bar Huawei from taking part in its 5G infrastructure rollout, as well as mounting warnings from the United States that the company\u2019s ties to the Chinese government make its products vulnerable to snooping or interference \u2014 an accusation Huawei strongly denies.\\r\\n\u201cThe U.S. advocates for secure telecoms networks and supply chains that are free from suppliers subject to foreign government control or undue influence,\u201d the United States Embassy in Australia said in a statement on Wednesday.\\r\\nIt added, \u201cWe routinely urge allies and friends to consider such risks and exercise similar vigilance in ensuring the security of their own telecoms networks and supply chains.\u201d\\r\\nHuawei said it was looking into the matter. \u201cAs the G.C.S.B. has noted, this is an ongoing process,\u201d the company said in a statement, referring to the Government Communications Security Bureau of New Zealand. \u201cWe will actively address any concerns and work together to find a way forward.\u201d\\r\\nHuawei says that it is a private company and is not controlled by Beijing.\\r\\nNew Zealand\u2019s rejection further solidifies a wall that is increasingly dividing the world into two. There are places that will accept Chinese technology in sensitive areas like telecommunications, and places that won\u2019t. The United States government has long deemed Huawei and another Chinese hardware maker, ZTE, to be potential menaces to security and privacy. And American lawmakers have voiced concerns about the two companies\u2019 business in other wealthy countries such as South Korea.\\r\\nElsewhere, especially in the developing world, Huawei\u2019s affordable equipment looks too good to turn down.\\r\\nOn Tuesday, Papua New Guinea said that it would uphold an agreement with Huawei to build domestic internet cables, turning down a joint counteroffer from Australia, the United States and Japan.\\r\\n\u201cWe have an existing agreement,\u201d William Duma, the state investment minister for the Pacific island nation, told reporters. Huawei has already completed 60 percent of the $200 million project, which is financed by the Export-Import Bank of China. Mr. Duma said that made the 11th-hour effort from the Western powers \u201ca bit patronizing.\u201d\\r\\nThe competing offer comes as concerns have grown in Australia and allied nations about China\u2019s investments in the resource-rich island countries of the Pacific Ocean. This year, Australia agreed to fund an undersea communications cable linking Sydney with the Solomon Islands, following a similar deal with Papua New Guinea.\\r\\nAustralian officials were worried that if the project went to Huawei, as the Solomon Islands had agreed in 2016, the Chinese company might gain access to Australia\u2019s internet infrastructure. In 2012, Huawei was barred out of security concerns from bidding on projects for Australia\u2019s national broadband network. The company has, however, sold equipment to Australian cellular operators.\\r\\nLike Australia, New Zealand has been grappling with a series of scandals related to Chinese influence. Last month, a New Zealand lawmaker was accused of trying to hide a campaign contribution from a businessman with ties to the Chinese Communist Party. Another lawmaker was revealed last year to have been a member of the Communist Party in China who taught English to spies there.\\r\\nMore recently, agents of Beijing were blamed for a burglary targeting a New Zealand professor who studies the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s influence in Western countries.\\r\\nDespite those concerns, New Zealand has been relatively tactful in dealing with China, experts say. As a result, its two-way trade with China has more than tripled in the past decade, according to government statistics, and the bilateral relationship has become one of New Zealand\u2019s most important.\\r\\nLast year, New Zealand became the first advanced economy to join China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, an ambitious infrastructure program stretching through much of Asia that is widely seen as an effort to extend Beijing\u2019s political influence.\\r\\nPapua New Guinea is also a signatory to the Belt and Road Initiative, which has drawn it closer to China. That has not stopped officials there from raising questions about potential ties between Huawei and the Chinese government, according to a report on Tuesday by Danielle Cave, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.\\r\\nBut in a region in desperate need of infrastructure, officials may take funding where they can get it, said Mr. Duma, the Papua New Guinea minister.\\r\\nSecurity concerns are \u201cfor the big boys to worry about,\u201d he said.\\r\\nThe joint offer that Papua New Guinea rejected on Tuesday came too late, said Jonathan Pryke, director of the Pacific islands program at the Lowy Institute in Sydney.

The image is typical of the Johannesburg-based photographer\u2019s theatrical self-portraits, where hairstyles, headgear and objects as diverse as a majestic necklace of cowrie shells or a wooden stool worn as a hat or crown suggest multiple personas and layers of historic, cultural and political meaning.\\r\\nAs Muholi has said, you might look at the latex gloves, \u201cand think of balloons and play, rather than the constraints of work and domesticity or the need to breathe, to feel deflated.\u201d Characteristic of Muholi\u2019s work, that photograph is about all of these things, and much more.\\r\\nThe image is one of more than 90 self-portraits in \u201cZanele Muholi: Somnyama Ngonyama, Hail the Dark Lioness\u201d (Aperture), a monograph accompanying a traveling exhibition organized by Ren\u00e9e Mussai for Autograph ABP in London and now at the Spelman College Museum of Fine Art in Atlanta through Dec. 8. In addition to photographs, the book contains essays, criticism and poems by more than 20 curators, art historians and writers.\\r\\nThe self-portraits function on various levels and pay homage to the history of black women in Africa and beyond, the dark lionesses of the book\u2019s title. They reimagine black identity in ways that are largely personal but inevitably political. And they challenge the stereotypes and oppressive standards of beauty that often ignore people of color. \u201cAll this stereotyping inspires a deep-seated hatred of the black body, from head to toe: eyes, lips, everything, your features,\u201d said Muholi in a recent interview with Ms. Mussai\\r\\nMuholi, who eschews gender-specific pronouns,  is co-founder of the Forum for the Empowerment of Women, which advocates for the rights of black lesbians in South Africa, as well as the founder of Inkanyiso, a collective for queer activism and visual media. Activism is central to Muholi\u2019s photographs, work that taps into the tradition of empowerment through black self-representation. Since the 19th century, the photographic portrait has allowed black people to represent themselves as they want to be seen, not how others pigeonhole or even dismiss them.\\r\\n\u201cI wanted to use my face so that people will always remember just how important our black faces are, when confronted by them,\u201d said Muholi, who prefers to be called a \u201cvisual activist\u201d rather than an artist. \u201cFor this black face to be recognized as belonging to a sensible, thinking being in their own right.\u201d\\r\\nMuholi\u2019s portraits inspire by example, self-discovery and resistance. They build on earlier series devoted to visual activism, such as \u201cFaces and Phases,\u201d \u201cInnovative Women\u201d and \u201cTransfigures,\u201d which documented black lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex South Africans, in response to the persecution, violence and invisibility they endured.\\r\\n\u201cToo often I find we are being mimicked, and distorted, by the privileged other,\u201d said Muholi. \u201cWe are here; we have our own voices; we have our own lives.\u201d In this regard, the photographer wants to \u201cteach people about our history, to rethink what history is all about, to reclaim it for ourselves, to encourage people to use artistic tools such as cameras as weapons to fight back.\u201d Those words echo Gordon Parks, who more than a half-century ago called the camera his \u201cweapon of choice\u201d against racism, poverty and injustice.\\r\\nUsing richly symbolic poses, props and situations, Muholi\u2019s self-portraits represent African identity as nuanced and incongruous \u2014 from a stoic figure engulfed by a snakelike vacuum-cleaner hose to a series of pictures dedicated to Muholi\u2019s late sister, Basizeni, images that serve both as elegies and as \u201cconversations with the legion of \u2018ancestral slaves,\u2019\u201d as Ms. Mussai wrote.\\r\\nAmong the most poignant images in \u201cSomnyama Ngonyama\u201d are those honoring the photographer\u2019s late mother, Bester Muholi. In several pictures, Muholi wears headdresses composed of scouring pads or clothespins that allude to Bester\u2019s work as a domestic. These images push the envelope of traditional portraiture, serving as respectful homage, pointed satire and thoughtful commentary on a difficult life made worse by apartheid.\\r\\n\u201cBester\u2019s headdress appears like a costume that undermines the pretensions of portraiture,\u201d the art historian Tamar Garb wrote in the book. \u201cBut it also asserts the defining role that she played in an economy of subservience and spectacle. The figure is framed by her labor, haunted by pictorial precedents, captured by the gaze of her desiring daughter, for whom the love of mother was always shared, never enough, gone too soon.\u201d\\r\\nWhen posting images online, Muholi often uses the hashtag #blackbeauty, an affirmation of how the artist is taking control of an attribute too often defined and represented by outsiders. Muholi implores viewers, like the liberated lioness of \u201cSomnyama Ngonyama,\u201d to question and free themselves from oppressive aesthetics.\\r\\n\u201cHow is black beauty defined? It changes over time, and it always seems fit in with the other\u2019s consumption,\u201d said Muholi. \u201cMy point is that black people should question this idea themselves.\u201d\\r\\nMuholi hopes that \u201cSomnyama Ngonyama\u201d will motivate black people facing racism, sexism and homophobia in Africa and beyond to resist and transcend the cultural limitations imposed on them.\\r\\n\u201cThe series touches on beauty, relates to historical incidents, giving affirmation to those who are doubting \u2014 whenever they speak to themselves, when they look in the mirror \u2014 to say, \u2018You are worthy, you count, nobody has the right to undermine you: because of your being, because of your race, because of your gender expression, because of your sexuality, because of all that you are.\u2019\u201d\\r\\nRace Stories is a continuing exploration of the relationship between race and photographic depictions of race by Maurice Berger.

The smell of fir from sidewalk Christmas tree vendors plunges me into memories: sparkling red and silver lights on childhood holiday boughs, the judder of a saw in my hand as I built spruce bookshelves, and the songs of wrens and hermit thrushes along a forested trail in Canada. This portal into the past is opened by odor alone, by the fir needles perfuming whole city blocks.\\r\\nNo other sense is as direct as smell. No other sense is as ancient. Smell bypasses the neural processing centers that mediate all other senses. The aroma of fir trees flies me directly into specific wordless memories: childhood holidays, hand-sawn woodwork and my feet tramping through wet forests. When I breathe in, signals run along nerves wired straight to the parts of my brain governing emotional memory and associative learning. My conscious brain catches up later, adding a patina of language.\\r\\nThis inward journey into human remembrance is mirrored by an outward connection to the lives of trees and forests. The chemical conversation between cells and air- and waterborne aromatic molecules unites all living beings, from animal noses to plant root tips to the cell surfaces of bacteria. The scents of holiday trees evoke primal experience.\\r\\nOther trees and their products join fir\u2019s resinous spice in the seasonal bouquet. Roasting chestnuts loose sweet, earthy scents on street corners. Hanukkah olive oil perfumes the kitchen \u2014 sharp and green from early-season harvests, rounded gold from later pressings. The spiced wine of pomegranate mingles with the tannic nose-bite of olives and tree nuts on Persian Yalda tables marking the winter solstice. In the Southwest, pi\u00f1on pine wood smoke is the winter incense of the desert mountains.\\r\\n[Discover the most compelling features, reporting and humor writing from The New York Times Opinion section, selected by our editors. Sign up for the Sunday Best newsletter.]\\r\\nMidwinter tree aromas connect us not only to memory but also to the language of trees. Every tree lives in connection with thousands of other species \u2014 bacteria, fungi, insects, other plants \u2014 and aromas are the links that hold together this community. Plant leaves use odoriferous molecules to defend themselves from insects and fungi, to cope with heat stress, to listen to the health of other plants and to summon parasitic insects to devour leaf-eating pests. Fruits use aromatic oils and alcohols to deter the growth of bacteria and attract seed-dispersing frugivorous animals. The unique aroma of each plant species results from a blend of thousands of molecules, an olfactory manifestation of the diverse chemical ecologies of trees.\\r\\nSoil and air are wrapped into these aromatic connections. A lively chemical chatter below ground allows plant roots, fungi and bacteria to trade food and information, exchanges essential for the vitality of trees and soil alike. When tree and soil aromas drift skyward, they act as water-gathering hubs, seeding raindrops. Forests, with help from oceans and grasslands, are the planet\u2019s soil-builders and rainmakers.\\r\\nAll of these connections account for the richness of forests. For 400 million years, forests have been the primary centers of biological diversity on land, home today to 80 percent of terrestrial biodiversity. They are the great mediators of global cycles of water, carbon and oxygen. Human life would be impossible without forests. They give us breath and send clean water to rivers and fields. Forests have, since the origin of humanity, fed, warmed and sheltered us.\\r\\nYet, despite their importance to our well-being, we\u2019re often disconnected from the lived, sensory experience of trees. Seasonal rituals let us heal this disconnection. \\r\\nTrees need not be mere props in our winter celebrations. Instead, we can honor the ecological roots of traditions. Holiday firs bring the scents, hues and textures of the great boreal forest, storehouse of carbon and home to billions of migratory animals. The aroma of olive oil tells of the ancient reciprocity between people and olive trees, a bond that allowed Mediterranean cultures to thrive, even on arid land. Yule logs, roasted chestnuts and holiday fruits are reminders of our dependence on plants for food and fuel. All these traditions invite us to remember, enjoy and be thankful for the many connections that give us life.\\r\\nThis season, perhaps we could hear and answer the trees\u2019 invitation: Inhale. Smell the needles, wood, oil and fruit. Then, expand the bounds of ritual and celebration to include the trees and the living Earth to which we belong. In these dark days, it is good to remember that we need one another.\\r\\nDavid George Haskell (@dghaskell), a professor at the University of the South, is the author of \u201cThe Songs of Trees\u201d and \u201cThe Forest Unseen.\u201d\\r\\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1913577139,\"description\":\"The season\u2019s scents of fir and pine evoke primal experiences, and remind us what we may lose.\\r\",\"title\":\"The Most Wonderful Smelling Time of the Year\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.15.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.__________\\r\\nCompanies that lag their peers sometimes cut accounting corners to make themselves appear stronger than they really are. But is the risk of getting caught worth it?\\r\\nThe recent news that the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission are looking at the accounting and disclosures of General Electric, Tesla and Snap does not bode well for the companies. An investigation of possibly faulty accounting typically looks deep into corporate books and public statements, and the government rarely commits resources without evidence that there may be significant misstatements.\\r\\nRegulators are suspicious.\\r\\nG.E. has been under scrutiny since January for an insurance charge totaling $15 billion over seven years related to long-term care and other policies. In October, the company announced a $22 billion accounting charge to write down the value of its power business. A division rarely loses that much value overnight. The S.E.C. and Justice Department expanded their investigations to include the latest charge, most likely to determine whether G.E. delayed recognizing such a sizable hit in the hope its fortunes would improve and allow it to avoid dealing with the problems.\\r\\nTesla already settled a securities fraud lawsuit with the S.E.C. over improper tweets by Elon Musk, its chief executive, about potentially taking the company private. That case revealed a broader investigation of the company about how it forecast production of its Model 3 sedan in 2017, including disclosure that the S.E.C. issued a subpoena about production rate projections for the vehicle.\\r\\nSnap disclosed that the S.E.C. and Justice Department sent it subpoenas for records related to its disclosure about competition from Instagram when it went public in March 2017. Regulators are investigating whether the company understated the impact of Instagram on its own growth \u2014 a key issue for investors in a tech company built around rapid user growth.\\r\\nWhat happens next?\\r\\nUnsurprisingly, all three companies vowed to cooperate with the government. Snap has taken the position that its disclosures were \u201caccurate and complete,\u201d while Tesla asserted that \u201cto our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred.\u201d Companies generally provide little information about how an investigation is progressing until they obtain a clear picture from the government about what might have gone awry.\\r\\nAccounting investigations can take months, or even years, to be resolved. That leaves investors with uncertainty as investigators pore over corporate records and try to build a case \u2014 and little hobbles a company\u2019s stock price more than investor uncertainty.\\r\\nThe presence of the Justice Department in all three investigations intensifies the pressure. Under a provision of the federal securities law, any person or company that \u201cwillfully and knowingly\u201d makes a false statement in any report filed with the S.E.C. can be prosecuted. Another rule makes it a violation for a company to \u201cfalsify or cause to be falsified, any book, record or account.\u201d Unlike a securities fraud claim, which requires proving an intent to mislead investors, accounting violations only require proof that false information was incorporated into corporate documents and financial statements \u2014 a much easier standard to meet.\\r\\nUnlike S.E.C. regulators, who typically settle cases without an admission or denial of liability, federal prosecutors generally require a company to acknowledge its violations in a statement of facts that is then incorporated into a deferred prosecution agreement. Any resolution of a criminal case, even if the company does not have to plead guilty, means that investors will be able to piggyback on the acknowledgment in private securities fraud lawsuits. That could add to the cost of any penalty that might be imposed.\\r\\nWarren Buffett once pointed out that \u201cyou only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out.\u201d But when your competitors are posting record profits and sales, the incentive to make yourself appear better can be very tempting, at least as long as the tide is high.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1435074445,\"description\":\"The companies can expect hobbled stock prices as the investigations play out, with penalties and private lawsuits if regulators identify wrongdoing.\\r\",\"title\":\"White Collar Watch: G.E., Tesla and Snap Are Under Accounting Investigation.

Other parties to the case, including a big pension fund for miners and states facing costly environmental cleanups, got pennies for every dollar they were owed.\\r\\nA McKinsey partner, Kevin Carmody, provided testimony to the bankruptcy court that the plan was in the best interests of all classes of creditors.\\r\\nFederal law \u201cplaces the burden on estate professionals to make required disclosures to ensure their disinterestedness,\u201d wrote John P. Fitzgerald III of the trustee office, which polices the bankruptcy court system and enforces the disclosure rules.\\r\\nInstead of making the required disclosures, Mr. Fitzgerald said, McKinsey spent more than two years dissembling and forcing the Justice Department and other parties \u201cto search for needles in haystacks.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Fitzgerald said he had determined that McKinsey\u2019s investment operation was not, as the company has long said, a \u201cblind trust\u201d separate from the consulting firm \u2014 in part because McKinsey\u2019s president, Jon Garcia, sat on the board of the investment group.\\r\\nThe federal office said McKinsey had tried to make it appear as if the investment unit\u2019s decisions were made by independent staff members, avoiding any mention that Mr. Garcia received regular reports on its decisions and ratified them.\\r\\n\u201cMcKinsey\u2019s misleading representation and lack of transparency regarding Mr. Garcia\u2019s role undermines the very purpose\u201d of the bankruptcy disclosure rules, Mr. Fitzgerald wrote.\\r\\nIn a statement, McKinsey said its disclosures \u201cfully meet the terms of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cWe have been transparent about the connections we were disclosing and the process utilized to identify those connections,\u201d the company said. It added, \u201cAs always, McKinsey is committed to taking any guidance the U.S. trustee deems appropriate to give.\u201d\\r\\nMcKinsey has made repeated statements, in court and on its website, that its investment division is walled off from its consulting business. That, McKinsey has said, precludes any possibility that the investments could taint the consultants\u2019 advice.\\r\\nSince there is no risk of undue influence, McKinsey has said, it does not have to disclose its investment activities to the court when it works on a bankruptcy case.\\r\\nThat argument was eventually challenged by Jay Alix, a retired bankruptcy restructuring expert. During the Alpha Natural Resources bankruptcy, Mr. Alix formed an investment partnership and became an unsecured creditor, giving him standing to challenge McKinsey over its disclosures. He eventually moved to have the bankruptcy reopened for an investigation of potential fraud.\\r\\nThat led to the investigation by the Office of the United States Trustee. Judge Kevin R. Huennekens will hear the office\u2019s request on Wednesday at the United States Bankruptcy Court in Richmond.\\r\\nMcKinsey\u2019s legal challenges are spreading into other courtrooms.\\r\\nOn Friday, a federal bankruptcy judge in Houston, David R. Jones, issued an order for the trustee office to review allegations about McKinsey\u2019s conduct in two bankruptcies there. Those allegations, if true, he said, could constitute criminal activity \u201cand otherwise impugn the integrity of the bankruptcy process.\u201d\\r\\nThe judge took pains to say he had not determined if any improper conduct had occurred, but said the Justice Department had an obligation to investigate and ensure the public\u2019s confidence in the system.\\r\\nThe order was in response to a lengthy objection filed on Thursday in the bankruptcy of Westmoreland Coal. Mr. Alix, who filed the objection, cited dozens of instances in which, he said, McKinsey\u2019s business relationships were in conflict with its duty to its bankrupt clients.\\r\\nIn a statement, McKinsey said it believed it had always complied with disclosure requirements and would challenge Mr. Alix\u2019s \u201cbaseless allegations.\u201d\\r\\nAmong the cases he cited were those involving GenOn, whose bankruptcy Judge Jones oversaw last year, and Puerto Rico \u2014 essentially one of the biggest bankruptcies in American history, with $123 billion of debt and unfunded pensions.\\r\\nMcKinsey is advising Puerto Rico\u2019s federal oversight board while its investment unit directly and indirectly holds Puerto Rican bonds. McKinsey owns a family of hedge funds called Compass, which holds a class of bonds that, if restructured according to current plans, would return more than double what McKinsey paid for them.\\r\\nNone of those holdings were disclosed. McKinsey has said the federal law governing Puerto Rico\u2019s case, called Promesa, contains no provision requiring advisers to be disinterested.\\r\\nThe disclosure of McKinsey\u2019s holdings in Puerto Rico by The New York Times prompted the federal oversight board to hire a law firm to investigate.\\r\\nRepresentative Andy Biggs, an Arizona Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, has disputed McKinsey\u2019s position that it has no disclosure requirements under Promesa. He said that the law\u2019s drafters had left out only the requirement that advisers be disinterested, and that the disclosure requirements were intact.\\r\\nIt could be a simple matter for Congress to clarify that, he said, and then advisory firms like McKinsey would have to make the usual disclosures.\\r\\n\u201cIn the end, Congress is going to have to act,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want everybody to be honest brokers, but sometimes they\u2019re not.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":275771716,\"description\":\"A request to force the return of about $20 million in fees involves a coal company bankruptcy in which McKinsey was both an adviser and a creditor.\\r\",\"title\":\"Justice Dept.

What are the effects of vitamin B12 deficiency if left untreated?\\r\\nA. A deficiency of vitamin B12 can cause neurological and psychiatric problems that \u201ccan progress if left untreated, and can lead to irreversible damage,\u201d said Dr. Donald Hensrud, director of the Mayo Clinic\u2019s Healthy Living Program. Fortunately, it can be reversed fairly easily with vitamin pills or injections.\\r\\nVitamin B12 is required for proper red blood cell formation, nerve function and DNA synthesis. It is naturally present in fish, meat, eggs and dairy products, as well as some fortified breakfast cereals and nutritional yeast products.\\r\\nStrict vegans who avoid animal products can develop a deficiency of B12 over time if they don\u2019t take a supplement. But two-thirds of cases occur in the elderly, who are susceptible because they may not absorb adequate amounts of B12 from foods but who are not routinely tested, Dr. Hensrud said.\\r\\nConsequences of B12 deficiency can cause a range of symptoms that include fatigue, weakness, constipation, loss of appetite and weight loss. Other symptoms include difficulty maintaining balance, depression, confusion, dementia, poor memory and soreness in the mouth or tongue.\\r\\nB12 deficiency may also result in a form of anemia called megaloblastic anemia, which can also result from a deficiency of folic acid, another B vitamin. If anemia is detected on blood tests, levels of both vitamins should be checked.\\r\\nNeurological symptoms can, however, occur in the absence of anemia. Early treatment is critical to avoid potentially irreversible damage.\\r\\nOlder adults are susceptible to B12 deficiency because they may have decreased secretion of hydrochloric acid in the stomach, which makes it difficult to absorb B12. \\r\\nAlso vulnerable to B12 deficiency are those with gastrointestinal disorders like celiac disease or Crohn\u2019s disease; those who have had weight loss or other gastrointestinal surgery; and those who use certain acid reflux drugs or the diabetes drug metformin. Individuals with pernicious anemia, which affects up to 2 percent of older adults, are also susceptible.\\r\\nDo you have a health question?

The country\u2019s scientists are accustomed to attention-grabbing headlines by their colleagues as they race to dominate their fields.\\r\\nBut when He Jiankui announced on Monday that he had created the world\u2019s first genetically edited babies, Chinese scientists \u2014 like those elsewhere \u2014 denounced it as a step too far.

Faced with a population that is growing sicker and older, the government is spending millions of dollars specifically on becoming a leader in \u201cgenetic manipulation technology.\u201d\\r\\nTo strengthen its position, the government has sought to lure home successful Western-trained Chinese researchers like Dr. He. He was a beneficiary of the Thousand Talents Plan, which gives scientists tens of thousands of dollars in funding and help with housing and schooling for their children.\\r\\nBefore he became infamous this week, those who knew of Dr. He saw him as a modern Chinese success story.\\r\\nHe was born to farmers in one of the poorest parts of Hunan Province in southern China. As a high school student, he built a small laboratory at home, believing he could be China\u2019s Einstein, according to an article this week by Jiemian, a Chinese news website. He graduated from the University of Science and Technology of China with a physics degree.\\r\\nBut by the time he arrived in the United States on a Chinese government scholarship, Dr. He felt the golden age of physics was over, according to the article. He switched to biophysics and studied at Rice University in Houston, where he first worked with Crispr, the gene-editing technology he says he used to alter the babies\u2019 genes.\\r\\nAfter studying at Rice, Dr. He went on to postdoctoral research at Stanford University. In 2012, he returned to China, basing himself in the booming southern metropolis of Shenzhen, which gave him funding. Dr. He founded two genetic testing companies, Direct Genomics and Vienomics, which aimed to use gene sequencing for medical purposes.\\r\\nMany scientists in China say the drive to succeed is so strong that they adopt a \u201cdo first, debate later\u201d approach. Wang Yue, a professor at the institute of medical humanities of Peking University, said many scientists lacked awareness of medical ethics and of laws and regulations relevant to their fields.\\r\\n\u201cIt is true that many scientists are very bold and think of science as their independent kingdom,\u201d Dr. Wang said. \u201cSo they are not willing to listen to the outside world, including ethics committees and administrative agencies that want to supervise and review them.\u201d\\r\\nIn China, clinical trials are vetted for ethical concerns just once, by a hospital\u2019s ethics review committee. Dr. He said his research was approved by the ethics board of the hospital Shenzhen Harmonicare. The hospital denied that, although one of its shareholders had appeared in an Associated Press video talking about Dr. He\u2019s project.\\r\\nAdding to the confusion, the university to which Dr. He is attached, the Southern University of Science and Technology, said it had had no idea that Dr. He was conducting research on babies, even though he said he got his funding from the university. At the genome editing conference in Hong Kong, Dr. He acknowledged that he had not informed his university about his research.\\r\\nDr. He told a genome editing conference in Hong Kong on Wednesday that he was proud of what he had done, saying he intended to engineer babies who would not be vulnerable to H.I.V. infection. He recruited couples for his research in which the man had H.I.V. and the woman did not.\\r\\nMany scientists have noted that there are simpler ways to protect newborn babies with an infected parent from getting H.I.V. But Chinese couples have less access to such treatments because of a law barring people with \u201csexual diseases,\u201d including H.I.V., from in vitro fertilization treatment. That suggests that Dr. He would have been more likely to find willing recruits among couples living with H.I.V.\\r\\nBai Hua, the head of Baihualin, an AIDS advocacy group that helped Dr. He recruit the couples, said that he now regretted doing so and was deeply worried about the families. In a statement posted on his organization\u2019s official WeChat account, Mr. Bai, who uses a pseudonym, said he felt \u201cdeceived, but I don\u2019t want to shirk responsibility.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cI hope to use this venue to launch a specific appeal,\u201d Mr. Bai wrote. \u201cWith the occurrence of this incident, please conduct more ethics-related science and medical training for volunteers in the AIDS community as well as medical workers and staff in these related fields.\u201d\\r\\nAt the conference in Hong Kong this week, Dr. He said the parents of the twins and seven other couples who participated in his research had been fully informed of the risks involved, and that they understood what was being done to their embryos.\\r\\nBut one H.I.V.-infected man Dr. He\u2019s team tried to recruit said he was not told of the ethical concerns about editing human embryos, according to Sanlian Weekly, a Chinese newsmagazine. The man said a researcher had told him that the probability of his having an unhealthy baby was low and that the team had achieved a high success rate in testing with animals.\\r\\nThe man said the researcher left him feeling that the procedure had more potential for benefits than risks. But his wife was concerned that harvesting the eggs would be painful, and the man decided not to sign up, according to the article.\\r\\nDr. He\u2019s announcement was a moment of reckoning for gene editing well beyond China. Jennifer Doudna, a co-inventor of Crispr and a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said it was \u201can opportunity to change how we\u2019re regulating scientific use of this technology,\u201d possibly by making the \u201csomewhat vague\u201d guidelines more specific. She said severe consequences could be established for breaking those guidelines, perhaps even involving an international body like the United Nations.\\r\\nIn China, many say an update of the laws governing genetic research is long overdue. A former vice minister of health, Huang Jiefu, called for the establishment of a central body to supervise bioscience experiments, according to the state-run Global Times newspaper. He said the country\u2019s 2003 regulations governing embryo experiments \u2014 which the government says Dr. He violated \u2014 were outdated.\\r\\nWang Yuedan, a professor of immunology at Peking University, said the penalties for violating those regulations were not harsh enough. They are not legally binding and do not detail any punishments.\\r\\n\u201cWhat happened this time was an ethics disaster for the world,\u201d Dr. Wang said. \u201cBut perhaps it will encourage biomedical research scientists all over the world, including China, to pay more attention to the ethical guidelines regarding the human body.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1122991796,\"description\":\"He Jiankui\u2019s claim to have edited babies\u2019 genes has caused soul-searching in China, where many believe scientists need more ethical supervision.\\r\",\"title\":\"In China, Gene-Edited Babies Are the Latest in a String of Ethical Dilemmas\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.8.txt\"}],\"labelMap\":[[1722736910,\"technology\"],[400461429,\"business\"],[2077851121,\"world\"],[1019667209,\"science\"],[-609817461,\"technology\"],[-1598217453,\"world\"],[-127290936,\"business\"],[-1380752202,\"technology\"],[899104254,\"business\"],[1619928508,\"technology\"],[-1715214620,\"world\"],[1992551465,\"world\"],[-1021200076,\"world\"],[-688677695,\"business\"],[-592673889,\"business\"],[-528635652,\"business\"],[659434447,\"business\"],[-941424805,\"technology\"],[61447817,\"technology\"],[1866762063,\"business\"],[226578938,\"business\"],[-395185457,\"world\"],[1931849537,\"world\"],[1939608425,\"science\"],[879478646,\"world\"],[362076829,\"business\"],[1290383638,\"world\"],[39893848,\"world\"],[923122725,\"business\"],[1868053901,\"science\"],[-2031516895,\"technology\"],[-928747408,\"world\"],[1700442969,\"world\"],[-223316633,\"world\"],[154133607,\"world\"],[-1443018195,\"business\"],[-1729538912,\"business\"],[-236230005,\"business\"],[-1464142297,\"science\"],[-393469223,\"world\"],[1913577139,\"world\"],[-1435074445,\"business\"],[275771716,\"business\"],[625140153,\"business\"],[-1122991796,\"science\"]],\"confusionMatrix\":[[6,0,0,1,2],[4,0,2,0,3],[0,0,2,4,3],[5,0,1,1,2],[2,0,0,1,6]],\"confusionLabels\":[\"business\",\"health\",\"science\",\"technology\",\"world\"],\"relabelingLabelMap\":[],\"accuracy\":0.3333333333333333,\"correctRelabeled\":[],\"labelingPrecision\":null,\"labelingRecall\":0,\"correctAssignedItems\":[],\"assignmentPrecision\":null,\"openedItems\":[],\"numOpenedItems\":0,\"selectedItems\":[1019667209,-1715214620,1939608425,39893848,-1443018195,625140153,352454371,1661884937,2013679196,-1402549340,621865094,2146958509],\"selectedInCategory\":6,\"selectionRecall\":0.5454545454545454},{\"modelOperation\":\"add\",\"changedFiles\":[{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Kevin Love had always found refuge in basketball \u2014 a sport at which he excels.\\r\\nBut his team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, was not playing very well early in the 2017-18 season.

It said a guest was welcome, too. I volunteered, and she registered me as well. \\r\\nAnd the host? An insurance salesman, Arif M. Halaby, who I quickly discovered had been the subject of a state cease-and-refrain order earlier in the decade because of certain financial products that an administrative law judge determined that he had sold. The state found that Mr. Halaby was offering \u201cunqualified\u201d securities after an ailing older client pulled equity from his home to invest in a real estate development in Costa Rica. \\r\\nI had long wanted to attend one of these steak dinners, and if you are in or near retirement, or sort the mail of people who are, you might be curious about them as well. Such dinners have been a cause for concern.\\r\\nAlmost a decade ago, in \u201cProtecting Older Investors: 2009 Free Lunch Seminar Report,\u201d AARP said 63 percent of the people it had surveyed had received an invitation like the one my aunt found in her mailbox. Among that group, 57 percent had received five or more within the previous three years. The organization figured that 5.9 million people ages 55 or over had attended at least one seminar.\\r\\nAARP\u2019s protective instincts were warranted. Two years earlier, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the North American Securities Administrators Association and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority sent examiners to 110 free-meal seminars. They found that 57 percent of the time, the salespeople used materials that \u201cmay have been misleading or exaggerated or included seemingly unwarranted claims.\u201d \\r\\nI genuinely hoped not to encounter any such thing Tuesday night. But I did.\\r\\nA life-size picture of Mr. Halaby, a former police officer, greeted us on a banner in the foyer of the private dining room. Once we were inside, I saw a large chart on a stand up front. It turned out we were there to learn about equity indexed annuities, a complicated insurance product that I wrote about with a fair bit of skepticism back in 2008.\\r\\nIn short (and short is hard when trying to break down products like these), equity indexed annuities tend to work something like this: You hand over a sum of money to an insurance company for a period of time, and at the end you are guaranteed to get at least that much money back if you don't take some money out along the way. You generally don\u2019t get a monthly check, and you agree not to take large amounts out during that period unless you are willing to pay a penalty. As for that equity index part, the insurance company will generally add money to the amount you initially plunked down, providing a portion of the gains reflected in whatever stock index the insurance company is using. \\r\\nMr. Halaby\u2019s staff distributed material before dinner that included a chart that looked like the one at the front of the room. It showed an equity indexed annuity performing 8.29 percent better, after an 18-year period from 1998 to 2016, than the S&P 500 stock market index.\\r\\nBut the pamphlet\u2019s chart has some fine print \u2014 so small that my 47-year-old eyes could barely make it out \u2014 that disclosed the following: The index it was using was not accounting for the reinvestment of dividends from all those stocks.\\r\\nA quick email the next morning to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, confirmed the following: When you do reinvest dividends, that basket of stocks does 33.72 percent better than the annuity.\\r\\nI had hoped to ask our host some questions after the steak, which was cooked medium unwell (no one asked how I wanted it prepared). But by then, Mr. Halaby, who has an active license to sell insurance, including annuities, was gone.\\r\\nI made an appointment to meet him at his office the next morning, and he did not seem happy to see me once I told him who I was. He disparaged my employer and profession and accused me of attending under false pretenses. \\r\\nI explained to him that I wanted to experience the dinner as any invited guest would have. My aunt\u2019s R.S.V.P. used my real name, and Mr. Halaby seems to invite anyone and everyone to attend one of his events via his website, as long as you hand over your name, address, phone number and email. \\r\\nI tried to ask him a long list of questions, starting with a few about that chart. At first, he said he would talk to me if I gave him five references of other people I had written about. (I sent him several names later that day.) Then, he gave me the name of a person he identified as his lawyer and told me to contact her about the chart. (She eventually declined to answer any of my questions.)\\r\\nWhen I turned my line of inquiry to the cease-and-refrain order, he got up from his chair and said, \u201cWe\u2019re done.\u201d Then he showed me the door.\\r\\nHe told me over the phone on Thursday night, after I returned to New York, that he did not deliberately send mail to people over 70 years old and resented what he called the \u201cdog whistle\u201d effect of writing about someone older than that, as if I were trying to imply that he was preying on people well into their older years. I said no one had asked my aunt\u2019s age when she R.S.V.P.\u2019d. Another point I made: I know that mailing list rental firms aren\u2019t perfect \u2014 the 50-something relative whose invitation arrived at my aunt\u2019s hadn\u2019t lived there for 15 years \u2014 but my aunt had also given me an identical invitation that a 76-year-old friend received at his home address. \\r\\nTo learn more about the chart in the pamphlet, I contacted the annuity company that created it, American Equity Investment Life Holding Company. \\r\\nI asked Steven D. Schwartz, vice president of investor relations for the company, why the chart doesn\u2019t show the returns for the S&P 500 with reinvested dividends. He said it was because the point of the chart is to show the lack of volatility of an equity indexed annuity compared with the S&P 500.\\r\\nOf course, showing the S&P 500 with reinvested dividends would also do that.\\r\\nIn any event, Mr. Schwartz said, Mr. Halaby should not be using that chart, because the company has discontinued the annuity it depicts. \\r\\n\u201cIt is expected that our independent producers will use current materials,\u201d Mr. Schwartz wrote in an email, using industryspeak for salespeople who don\u2019t work directly for the insurance companies. \\r\\nWhen I asked Mr. Halaby about that, he told me that someone who had not been working for him for very long put the old chart in the pamphlet. He added that the chart behind him at the dinner, which to my eyes looked identical to the one in the pamphlet, was in fact different. He would not tell me what company had created it. \\r\\nAmerican Equity\u2019s updated chart, which it sent me Thursday, shows the S&P 500 \u2014 still with no reinvested dividends \u2014 doing a bit better than a hypothetical indexed annuity for a period starting in 2006 and ending in 2017. To Mr. Halaby\u2019s credit, he made no outsize promises during the dinner. \u201cThe primary thing is not to lose your money,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cMy job is not to make you rich.\u201d It was reasonable, he said, for those in attendance to expect their money to grow 3 to 6 percent annually in an equity indexed annuity. Some people thought it was a compelling pitch; there was a smattering of applause when his presentation ended.\\r\\nSuch annuities may be suitable for some risk-averse retirees who are tired of owning stocks. But as I wrote a decade ago, you can probably get better returns during retirement (and not be penalized for taking too much out too soon) by investing mostly in ultrasafe bonds and adding some stock index fund exposure too.\\r\\nThere are probably plenty of advisers who sell useful products over a steak dinner. But as my experience here demonstrates, you shouldn\u2019t show up for one without doing a couple of things. First, conduct a quick online search about the host, including a check of the central database for stockbrokers\u2019 black marks and the similar ones that state insurance departments maintain. Mr. Halaby\u2019s run-in with the state is right there on the first page of his Google search results.\\r\\nThen, read any and all fine print, even if it requires a magnifying glass. Ask lots of questions. AARP published a good list several years ago, though I\u2019d add another one: Why aren\u2019t referrals from happy customers alone enough to keep you in business? \\r\\nIf you\u2019re still intrigued by a particular product or pitch, don\u2019t move any money right away. Get a second or third opinion from an independent financial planner, perhaps one who charges by the hour and has no stake in your decision.\\r\\nWhile the steak dinner pitch might not be a con game, it is a bit of a psychological dance. You attend, you eat free food and by the time the cheesecake arrives, you may feel you owe a salesperson a one-on-one meeting.\\r\\nThen you\u2019re on the hook. If these meals didn\u2019t catch lots of people, salespeople wouldn\u2019t keep paying for them.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-933914943,\"description\":\"Free meals have long been a tool that investment professionals use to reel in clients.

The entry for Mr. Ma identified him as a party member.\\r\\nIt may sound contradictory that the wealthy Mr. Ma belongs to an organization that got its start calling for the empowerment of the proletariat. But Mr. Ma\u2019s political affiliation came as no surprise to many Chinese and China watchers. Though it still publicly extols the principles of Karl Marx, the Chinese Communist Party largely abandoned collectivist doctrine in the post-Mao era, freeing private entrepreneurs to help build the world\u2019s second-largest economy after the United States.\\r\\nIn fact, the disclosure reveals a party that is eager to prove its legitimacy by affiliating itself with capitalist success stories. Mr. Ma is a tech rock star in China, and his membership in the party could prod others to follow his lead.\\r\\n\u201cEven Jack Ma is a party member,\u201d said Kellee Tsai, dean of humanities and social science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, referring to the party\u2019s pitch. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it make you want to join the party, too?\u201d\\r\\nAlibaba declined to comment on the matter. The Hurun Report, a research organization in Shanghai that tracks the wealthy in China, estimates Mr. Ma and his family\u2019s net worth at 270 billion renminbi, or $39 billion.\\r\\nToday\u2019s party isn\u2019t exactly exclusive. Its members represent nearly 7 percent of China\u2019s population. Its ranks include government officials, businesspeople and even dissidents. Being a member often suggests a desire to network and get ahead rather than express one\u2019s political views.\\r\\nFor businesspeople in particular, membership is more often a matter of expediency. Party membership provides a layer of protection in a country where private ownership protections are often haphazardly enforced or ignored entirely.\\r\\nThough its constitution still describes members as \u201cvanguard fighters of the Chinese working class imbued with communist consciousness,\u201d the party has veered away from its communist roots and welcomed private entrepreneurs since 2001. Some of the richest men in China are party members, including Wang Jianlin of the Dalian Wanda Group, a property and entertainment conglomerate, and Xu Jiayin of the Evergrande Group, a property developer.\\r\\nIt is unclear when Mr. Ma joined the party or how much he pays in dues. The party sets dues at 2 percent of monthly salary for higher-income members.\\r\\nThe star power of the Chinese entrepreneur class has dimmed since Xi Jinping became the country\u2019s top leader in 2012. Under Mr. Xi, the Communist Party plays a bigger role in not only Chinese politics but also the economy and everyday life. Any entity with more than three party members is required to set up a party cell. Some three-quarters of private enterprises, or 1.9 million, had done so in 2017, according to official data.\\r\\nCompanies say they face much greater pressure to set up the cells than in the past. Even some of the coolest start-ups in tech-savvy Beijing have designated party-building spaces.\\r\\nThe disclosure of Mr. Ma\u2019s membership reflects the thinking that the party controls the economy and society, said Guo Yuhua, a sociology professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing and a critic of the party.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s going backward from the Deng Xiaoping era, when the party advocated the separation of the party and the government,\u201d she said, referring to the party leader who ultimately governed China during its early years of reform in the 1970s and \u201980s.\\r\\nThe disclosure also drew attention because Mr. Ma had in the past tried to keep his distance from the government. When asked at public appearances how he managed government relations, he often said, \u201cFall in love with the government, but don\u2019t get married.\u201d\\r\\nBut as Mr. Xi tightens ideological controls and the power of the state grows, many successful entrepreneurs have made a point of showing their party loyalty.\\r\\nMr. Ma visited Yan\u2019an, the city often considered the birthplace of the Chinese Communist Revolution, in 2015, according to the Chinese news media. Pony Ma, who is chief executive of the internet giant Tencent Holdings but is not a party member, nonetheless showed up in Yan\u2019an as well this year, wearing a Red Army uniform. Yan\u2019an is also where Mr. Xi spent much of his teenage years.\\r\\nIn recent weeks, amid signs of a slowing economy and an intensifying trade war with the United States, China\u2019s leaders have taken a softer tone toward private enterprise, making supportive remarks and promising tax cuts.\\r\\nMaking it clear that Mr. Ma, the most successful businessman in China, is a member could strengthen the party\u2019s legitimacy.\\r\\n\u201cAbove all,\u201d said Ms. Tsai of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, \u201cthe party is quite open about the fact that it wants to survive.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":768893495,\"description\":\"Many business figures join the organization out of expedience.

The group that trained Mr. Chau for his mission and others have defended his actions and even hailed him as a martyr.\\r\\nBut other evangelicals argue that his push to contact the tribe on North Sentinel island, a group protected by Indian law, was reckless and unjustifiable. Some religious scholars, including evangelicals, are uncomfortable with Mr. Chau\u2019s approach. Scott Moreau, a professor at Wheaton College Graduate School in Illinois, is one of them.\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019m appalled by the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of thinking you go on a beach, you throw a fish at some people, you holler at them, and then you come back and spend the night and everything is going to be fine,\u201d Mr. Moreau said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t show much sensitivity, and it doesn\u2019t show much common sense.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Moreau was referring to Mr. Chau\u2019s account of his interaction with the Sentinelese in notes, recovered after his death, which described what happened when he approached the island for the first time on Nov. 15. By Nov. 16, he was dead.\\r\\nA central tenet of Christianity is sharing the faith, and churches have adopted varied approaches to evangelizing. Some encourage short-term missions abroad while others focus on recruiting and financially supporting missionaries who embed for years in one community or culture.\\r\\nMission work can be done around the world or around the block, by handing out tracts and knocking on doors, like the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. For evangelical Christians \u2014 Protestants who emphasize a personal relationship with Jesus, a \u201cborn again\u201d conversion experience and reading the Bible as God\u2019s word \u2014 spreading the Gospel is a way of life.\\r\\nFrom a young age, Mr. Chau became fixated on the idea of traveling to faraway lands and sharing his Christian faith.\\r\\nA few weeks ago, he set out for North Sentinel island with the aid of a local fisherman. An initial attempt to approach alone by kayak ended in the islanders\u2019 firing arrows at him, but he returned the next day, determined to make contact. By the following afternoon, the fisherman who returned to pick him up saw the islanders on a beach guarding an area where Mr. Chau\u2019s body was believed to be buried.\\r\\nSuch actions play into a myth of the \u201cmissionary hero,\u201d Mr. Moreau said.\\r\\n\u201cPart of the framing for the broader evangelical world is people have, for as long as history goes back, been willing to die to communicate their faith,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether he did it well is a second question which is critical, and I don\u2019t think he did it well at all.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mr. Chau\u2019s missionary friends were quick to praise the young man on social media, calling him an inspiration and a martyr for their shared cause.\\r\\nAccording to the Center for the Study of Global Christianity, there were an estimated 440,000 Christian missionaries working abroad in 2018. And while Mr. Chau\u2019s case is rare, the idea of martyrdom is not.\\r\\nKathryn Long, an expert in the history of American Christianity and also a professor at Wheaton College, called it the idea of being a \u201crisk-taker for God.\u201d\\r\\nThe concept goes back generations, she said, citing Jim Elliot\u2019s account of missionary work in the 20th century. Mr. Elliot, an American, died in 1956 along with four missionaries when they tried to make contact with a tribe in Ecuador.\\r\\n\u201cThey felt most evangelicals were too complacent in their faith, and they were looking for ways to trust God\u201d that went beyond the normal, Ms. Long said. \u201cBut the problem is: How do you know when you are taking a risk it\u2019s because God is leading you, or because you are crazy?\u201d\\r\\nMany missionaries are inspired by a passage in the Bible in which Jesus tells his disciples to spread his teachings across the world.\\r\\n\u201cI think that the people who come out of this tradition are not just fools or reckless colonialists,\u201d Ms. Long said. \u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than that.\u201d\\r\\nThe tribe on North Sentinel had shunned attempts at contact in the past, which experts say was in part because interactions with outsiders had resulted in violence and disease.\\r\\nPam Arlund, the director of training for All Nations, the missionary group that Mr. Chau trained with, said she had worked with him before his journey to the island. While All Nations did not offer logistical support to get him there, it offered linguistics training and spiritual support, she said.\\r\\n\u201cWe made it very clear the scope of the help that we could give him,\u201d she said.\\r\\nMs. Arlund said she felt that Mr. Chau had the appropriate preparation for his journey through his linguistics, wilderness and emergency first-aid training. She cited his numerous vaccinations and self-imposed quarantine ahead of his trip as a sign that he was considering the concerns of the tribe.\\r\\n\u201cJohn was not reckless or extreme at all, and he had put together a very responsible plan,\u201d she said. \u201cHe had counted the costs and knew that he might lose his life. But he had also put plans in place to protect the North Sentinelese. That\u2019s because he loved them.\u201d\\r\\nSome former missionaries say there is a broader problem with recklessness, though.\\r\\nCorey Pigg, who has a podcast and a blog titled \u201cFailed Missionary,\u201d spent years working for Youth With a Mission, an organization with links to All Nations.\\r\\nMr. Pigg was based in Germany and regularly conducted short-term missions to China, overseeing a group of young people. He said they often entered the country illegally, and he felt that the group was put at risk by an absence of appropriate oversight and the glorification of those who were persecuted for their faith.\\r\\n\u201cThe more martyr-complex tales you can send, the better \u2014 because that drives funding,\u201d he said, adding that part of the draw of China for him was that it was a difficult place to be a missionary.\\r\\n\u201cI wanted to go to China because it was closed,\u201d he said, \u201cand I was programmed to think it was very noble.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-790796664,\"description\":\"Some evangelicals say John Allen Chau\u2019s push to contact an isolated island tribe in the Indian Ocean was reckless.\\r\",\"title\":\"American\u2019s Death Revives Evangelical Debate Over Extreme Missionary Work\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"world.19.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"LONDON \u2014 Officials from nine countries examining Facebook\u2019s business practices have spent weeks trying to get the company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, to face questions at a hearing.\\r\\nOn Tuesday in London, Mr. Zuckerberg was represented by an empty chair.\\r\\nHe skipped the session, which was organized by a British committee investigating Facebook and the spread of misinformation. In Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s absence, officials spent more than three hours grilling a Facebook executive who stood in for him, criticizing the company\u2019s influence on democracy, its distribution of false news and its use of personal user data.\\r\\n\u201cYou have lost the trust of the international community,\u201d said Charlie Angus, an official representing Canada. He was joined by policymakers from Argentina, Brazil, Ireland, Latvia, Singapore, France, Belgium and Britain.\\r\\nThe hearing was built up by panel members as a moment of international accountability for Facebook. While the panel has no authority to impose laws or fines, it was a rare collaboration to investigate a company that is facing scrutiny after revelations about privacy breaches and its role in spreading propaganda and fomenting ethnic strife.\\r\\nAnticipation had built in recent days after the British official who called the hearing, Damian Collins, hinted that he might also release secret internal Facebook documents. The documents were originally uncovered during a California lawsuit over data sharing between Facebook and the maker of an app called Six4Three, and are under seal in the United States.\\r\\nBut Mr. Collins did not release the documents on Tuesday, saying he needed more time to go through them.\\r\\nThat left most of the hearing\u2019s spotlight on Richard Allan, Facebook\u2019s vice president for policy solutions, who attended the session in place of Mr. Zuckerberg and who sat next to the empty seat left for his boss.\\r\\nMr. Allan, also a member of the British House of Lords, said Facebook accepted a need for new regulation, without specifying which policies it would support.\\r\\n\u201cWe have damaged public trust through some of the actions we\u2019ve taken,\u201d said Mr. Allan, who later repeated variations of the same apology.\\r\\nHe added, \u201cThere were things that we missed that we were either not sufficiently focused on or too slow to react to.\u201d\\r\\nBut policymakers at the hearing were less than satisfied.

The issue is sensitive since Russia  used Facebook to manipulate American voters during the 2016 presidential election.\\r\\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Facebook said that \u201cthe engineer who had flagged those initial concerns subsequently looked into this further and found no evidence of specific Russian activity.\u201d Facebook also released the emails.\\r\\nOther policymakers, alluding to other internal Facebook documents, asked whether the company had ever restricted app developers\u2019 access to user data unless the developer had purchased mobile advertising. The company does not engage in such quid pro quo arrangements, Mr. Allan said.\\r\\nMr. Collins said he hoped to release the cache of internal Facebook documents within the \u201cnext week or so.\u201d The panel, he added, was still going through the papers to decide what was in the public interest to disclose and what information might need to be redacted to protect personal information.\\r\\nMr. Collins has faced questions about the methods he used to obtain the Facebook documents, which he got last week by dispatching Parliament\u2019s sergeant-at-arms to force the founder of Six4Three, Ted Kramer, to share the information while on a business trip to London.\\r\\nIn papers filed on Monday in California, lawyers for Mr. Kramer and Six4Three said Mr. Collins was put in touch with Mr. Kramer by Carole Cadwalladr, a reporter for The Guardian and The Observer.\\r\\nBoth Ms. Cadwalladr and Mr. Collins \u2014 at times working in concert \u2014 had sought to persuade Mr. Kramer to provide documents under seal in the litigation, in violation of a California court\u2019s order. Mr. Kramer said that Ms. Cadwalladr was the only person he had told where he was staying in London, suggesting she may have alerted Mr. Collins.\\r\\nMs. Cadwalladr didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\\r\\n(The Guardian, The Observer and The New York Times collaborated this year on a joint investigation into Cambridge Analytica, the now-defunct political consulting firm; Ms. Cadwalladr was among the reporters who worked on the investigation. The Times is also among several news organizations that have asked the California court to unseal some confidential documents in the Six4Three litigation.)\\r\\nMr. Collins defended the committee, saying it has the jurisdiction to get information related to its inquiry on British soil.\\r\\nWhile both Parliament and the United States Congress have occasionally used their privileges to publish otherwise confidential materials, legal experts said it was rare \u2014 if not unprecedented \u2014 for a British lawmaker to use those powers to subvert the lawful order of an American court.\\r\\n\u201cNow you\u2019ve got a clash between the court in California and the obligations in Parliament,\u201d said Mark Stephens, a lawyer based in London who specializes in international litigation. \u201cWe do see things like this from time to time.

He was 92.\\r\\nHis death was reported by British newspapers and by the Medical Research Council\u2019s Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England, where Dr. Klug had worked for decades. It did not say where he died.\\r\\nTrained as a physicist, Dr. Klug \u2014 Lithuanian-born and raised in South Africa \u2014 became interested in the 1960s in how techniques to discern the structure of crystals could be applied to biology. Initially he bounced X-rays off biological molecules, but in the mid-1960s he switched to electrons.\\r\\nElectron microscopy can make out tiny features as small as atoms, but it requires that samples be placed in a vacuum \u2014 an unfriendly environment for almost all components of living organisms.\\r\\nDr. Klug and his collaborators worked around that issue by using heavy metals to encase the molecules. In an interview, Richard Henderson, a colleague of Dr. Klug\u2019s at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology, explained the process:\\r\\n\u201cYou did a mold like a plaster of Paris mold of your hand, and then you could determine the structure of the plaster of Paris, and then, by implication, you\u2019d find out the structure of what was inside it. That\u2019s what they did in the \u203260s.\u201d\\r\\nBy making electron images from different directions, Dr. Klug was able to construct three-dimensional images.\\r\\nX-rays, not electron microscopy, was the primary method to decipher protein structures until recent years, when researchers figured out that freezing the molecules could preserve their structure. Dr. Klug was not involved with the latest advances, but \u201cthe mathematics behind it is the same mathematics that was developed in the \u203260s by Aaron Klug,\u201d Dr. Henderson said.\\r\\nThe Nobel committee cited Dr. Klug \u201cfor his development of crystallographic electron microscopy and his structural elucidation of biologically important nucleic acid-protein complexes.\u201d\\r\\nAaron Klug was born in Lithuania on Aug. 11, 1926. When he was 2, his family emigrated to South Africa, a more welcoming environment for Jews at the time. He enrolled at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg at the age of 15.\\r\\nAfter graduating with a bachelor of science degree, he obtained a master\u2019s degree at the University of Cape Town and then moved to England in 1949 to study at the University of Cambridge. He finished a doctorate there in 1953.\\r\\nDr. Klug, whose research had focused mostly on bouncing X-rays off crystals to determine their structure, had received an offer of a postdoctoral fellowship in Philadelphia at the Johnson Foundation for Medical Physics. He e was denied a visa, however, because a student organization he had belonged to in South Africa was deemed Communist. Instead he took a position at Birkbeck College in London to work on studying proteins using X-ray crystallography.\\r\\nThere he met Rosalind Franklin, whose X-ray images of DNA were crucial to Francis Crick and James D. Watson\u2019s figuring out the double helical structure of the molecule in the early 1950s.\\r\\nWhen Dr. Klug encountered her, in 1954, she was applying the same techniques to viruses, and the images enchanted Dr. Klug.\\r\\n\u201cThat determined, really, my scientific career, because up to then I hadn\u2019t had a firm idea of what I wanted to do,\u201d he said in an interview  for the Nobel Foundation in 2001. He switched to studying the structures of viruses.\\r\\nDr. Klug joined the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in 1962 and started working on the electron microscopy techniques.\\r\\nHe also moved on to other topics of research, spending six to eight years on one before switching to another. \u201cI think he quite liked the challenge of having some completely new problem to work on,\u201d Dr. Henderson said.\\r\\nDr. Klug was at the forefront of determining the structure of transfer RNA, a type of RNA molecule that helps decode the instructions for producing a protein. He studied chromatin, which holds the long strands of DNA in tight packages within a nucleus, and he discovered \u201czinc fingers,\u201d molecular motifs that can bind to specific DNA sequences. He also studied tangles of proteins associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\\r\\nDr. Klug acknowledged that he preferred being a pioneer in his research as opposed to expanding on others\u2019 work.\\r\\n\u201cAlmost everything I\u2019ve worked on, after I started, other people moved in and did all sorts of useful work,\u201d he told the Nobel Foundation. \u201cBut by then I\u2019d moved on to something else, because people jump in when they see something good and spoil the fun, really.\u201d\\r\\nDr. Klug was director of the laboratory from 1986 to 1996 and played a key role in establishing what is now the Wellcome Sanger Institute in England, which completed about a third of the sequencing of the Human Genome Project. He was president of the Royal Society, the world\u2019s oldest scientific organization, from 1995 to 2000. He was knighted in 1988.\\r\\nIn a tribute, Venki Ramakrishnan, president of the Royal Society, called Dr. Klug a \u201cgiant of 20th-century molecular biology who made fundamental contributions to the development of methods to decipher and thus understand complex biological structures.\u201d\\r\\nDr. Klug is survived by his wife of 70 years, Liebe; a son, David; and four grandchildren.

He has been in detention since Nov. 19, when he was arrested on his private jet soon after landing at Tokyo\u2019s Haneda Airport.\\r\\nMr. Ghosn, who forged the alliance as a groundbreaking industry model for sharing technology and cost savings, has yet to be charged. But the Nissan board voted unanimously to fire him as chairman last week. Mitsubishi Motors, a Japanese automaker that joined the alliance in 2016, removed him as its chairman on Monday.\\r\\nGreg Kelly, Mr. Ghosn\u2019s former chief of staff and a Nissan board member, who was arrested at the same time, will also be detained for 10 more days. A former head of human resources and an American, Mr. Kelly has been described by the company as a \u201cmastermind\u201d of the alleged financial wrongdoing. Both men were in Tokyo for a board meeting.\\r\\nUnder Japanese law, prosecutors can detain suspects for up to 22 days without filing charges, and can legally question them without a lawyer present.\\r\\nThe extended detentions give the Japanese authorities more time to interrogate the men, search Nissan\u2019s offices for evidence and determine whether to press charges. Prosecutors have said they suspect Mr. Ghosn earned around 10 billion yen, or about $88 million, at Nissan from 2011 to 2015 but reported only half of it. The other half was to be parceled out as deferred compensation after Mr. Ghosn, 64, retired.\\r\\nMr. Kelly is also alleged to have overseen the surreptitious purchase of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of housing for his boss through a Dutch company, Zi-A Capital, whose financial reports are opaque. Mr. Ghosn kept homes in Paris, Amsterdam, Rio de Janeiro and Beirut, Lebanon.\\r\\nDespite his accumulated wealth, Mr. Ghosn\u2019s outsize compensation packages at Renault and Nissan were a matter of contention at both companies, and each had sought to rein in his pay. Mr. Ghosn received around 8 million euros, or about $9 million, from Renault in 2017 and about the same amount at Nissan.\\r\\nMr. Ghosn has denied the allegations, the Japanese public broadcaster NHK said this week. Mr. Kelly has also denied wrongdoing, according to his attorney, Yoichi Kitamura.\\r\\nMr. Kitamura told The New York Times that Mr. Kelly maintained that Mr. Ghosn had the right to set his own pay, and that the executive had decided to pay himself \u00a51 billion a year as chief executive. Mr. Ghosn and Mr. Kelly are accused of underreporting his compensation in required securities filings. Mr. Kelly said the securities report did not understate the pay, Mr. Kitamura said.\\r\\nMr. Kitamura said Mr. Kelly maintained that he had consulted with an outside lawyer about a plan to defer Mr. Ghosn\u2019s compensation. According to Japanese media, Mr. Kelly has said he asked that lawyer to get approval from Japan\u2019s Financial Services Agency to ensure the plan was correct and that it did not need to be reported as current compensation.\\r\\nMr. Kitamura said Mr. Kelly believed that the plan was legal under Japanese law after consulting with an outside lawyer.\\r\\nIn France, where Renault is the biggest automaker, Mr. Ghosn\u2019s arrest has had political ramifications, including for President Macron.

Renault has described Mr. Ghosn as being \u201ctemporarily incapacitated.\u201d\\r\\nBruno Le Maire, the finance minister, has stated several times that France has \u201cno evidence\u201d of wrongdoing by Mr. Ghosn, and called on Nissan to turn over its dossier. Last week, he asked his Japanese counterpart to come to Paris to make a joint public statement on the matter.\\r\\nAt the G-20 meeting in Buenos Aires on Friday, Mr. Macron told Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan that he wanted to maintain the alliance between Renault and Nissan after Mr. Ghosn\u2019s arrest. Mr. Macron \u201creiterated his commitment to preserving the alliance as well as the stability of the group,\u201d the president\u2019s office said in a statement.\\r\\nIn the talks, Mr. Abe said that a stable Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance was important but that its future should be decided by stakeholders in the private sector rather than either government, according to a Japanese official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\\r\\nSince Mr. Ghosn pulled Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy over a decade ago, it has become the alliance\u2019s more profitable partner. In recent years, executives inside the company had raised the issue of rebalancing the relationship.\\r\\nRenault holds a 43 percent stake in Nissan, and the Japanese company holds a 15 percent stake in Renault, the same share as the French government. There have been tensions within the alliance \u2014 which accounted for 10.6 million car sales last year \u2014 as Renault has been the dominant partner.\\r\\nOn Thursday, officials from Renault and Nissan consulted in Amsterdam, where the alliance has its headquarters, and issued a statement that the board of directors of all three companies \u201cindividually and collectively emphatically reiterated their strong commitment to the alliance.\u201d The Japanese officials dialed in by teleconference.\\r\\nMr. Macron, who is facing low poll numbers and social unrest at home, can ill afford problems at Renault, which employs 47,000 people in France. Yet when he was France\u2019s economy minister in 2015, he helped inflame concerns within Nissan about Renault. Mr. Macron, a former Rothschild banker, ordered a surprise increase in the French government\u2019s stake in Renault, which was designed to double the state\u2019s voting rights.\\r\\nThe move, which Mr. Ghosn opposed in a bitter fight with Mr. Macron, rattled Nissan. Nissan has no voting rights in Renault, despite its 15 percent stake. Nissan threatened to leave the alliance\u2019s master agreement.\\r\\nSome French newspapers have questioned why and how Mr. Ghosn was being held for weeks without charges.

None of these accusations has yet resulted in formal charges.\\r\\n\\r\\nGifts for Tax Favors\\r\\nTHE PLAYERS Arnon Milchan, the Hollywood producer; James Packer, an Australian billionaire.\\r\\nTHE QUID Expensive cigars, jewelry and pink Champagne flowed abundantly into the prime minister\u2019s official Jerusalem residence, sometimes at his or his wife\u2019s request, but always with the compliments of Mr. Milchan or Mr. Packer, whom Mr. Milchan enlisted to share the cost of the gifts. The value of the gifts came to hundreds of thousands of dollars.\\r\\nTHE QUO Mr. Netanyahu promoted the extension of a 10-year tax exemption to expatriate Israelis returning to the country, which could benefit Mr. Milchan financially. The Finance Ministry blocked the legislation, saying it was against the national interest and fiscally unsound. Mr. Packer is not accused of receiving anything in return for his gifts to the Netanyahus.\\r\\nA Proposed Deal for Good Press\\r\\nTHE PLAYERS Arnon Mozes, the publisher of Yediot Ahronot, a leading Israeli daily newspaper; Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino magnate, who is a devoted supporter of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s and the financial backer of Israel Hayom, a rival paper; Ari Harow, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s former chief of staff, who turned state\u2019s evidence.\\r\\nTHE QUID Mr. Netanyahu discussed with Mr. Mozes the possibility of using his influence with Mr. Adelson, and perhaps of advancing legislation, to curb the circulation of Israel Hayom, which has long been seen as slavishly promoting Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s interests.\\r\\nTHE QUO In return, Yediot Ahronot would treat Mr. Netanyahu more favorably.\\r\\nTHE CATCH The trade was discussed, including on phone calls recorded by Mr. Harow, but was never consummated.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Second Deal for Good Press\\r\\nTHE PLAYERS Shaul Elovitch, a media tycoon and friend of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s; Shlomo Filber, the director-general of the communications ministry under Mr. Netanyahu; and Nir Hefetz, the Netanyahu family\u2019s public relations adviser. Mr. Filber and Mr. Hefetz became government witnesses.\\r\\nTHE QUID From 2014 to 2017, Mr. Netanyahu, while prime minister, also held the post of communications minister. Mr. Elovitch, who had long shared ownership of the Yes satellite network with Bezeq, Israel\u2019s biggest telecommunications company, bought a controlling stake in Bezeq in 2010. Heavily indebted, he arranged for Bezeq to buy Yes in 2015 for several times more than independent valuations showed Yes was worth. The communications ministry under Mr. Netanyahu aided several of Mr. Elovitch\u2019s moves, effectively helping him reap tens of millions of dollars. The police said they had seized about $32 million in ill-gotten gains.\\r\\nTHE QUO Bezeq also owns Walla news, a popular Israeli website. At the direction of Mr. Elovitch and Mr. Hefetz, the site consistently provided lopsidedly gauzy coverage of Mr. Netanyahu and his wife, suppressing or altering critical reports and padding inconsequential items with flattering photographs.\\r\\nCases in Which Netanyahu Was Not Accused\\r\\nTwo other police investigations did not wind up implicating Mr. Netanyahu. In one, an aide of his was suspected of trying to bribe a judge to quash a criminal case involving Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s wife. That case was closed in October for lack of evidence.\\r\\nSeparately, the police recommended last month that one of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s closest confidants \u2014 his personal lawyer and second cousin, David Shimron \u2014 and three others from his inner circle be charged in a sprawling bribery case involving the multibillion-dollar purchase of submarines and missile boats from Germany. Mr. Netanyahu was not a suspect in that case, though he was questioned in it.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1102185599,\"description\":\"The Israeli prime minister faces possible bribery and fraud charges stemming from three separate corruption investigations this year.\\r\",\"title\":\"The Corruption Cases Against Netanyahu\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"world.18.txt\"}],\"labelMap\":[[1722736910,\"technology\"],[400461429,\"business\"],[2077851121,\"world\"],[1019667209,\"science\"],[-609817461,\"technology\"],[-1598217453,\"world\"],[-127290936,\"business\"],[-1380752202,\"technology\"],[899104254,\"business\"],[1619928508,\"technology\"],[-1715214620,\"world\"],[1992551465,\"world\"],[-1021200076,\"world\"],[-688677695,\"business\"],[-592673889,\"business\"],[-528635652,\"business\"],[659434447,\"business\"],[-941424805,\"technology\"],[61447817,\"technology\"],[1866762063,\"business\"],[226578938,\"business\"],[-395185457,\"world\"],[1931849537,\"world\"],[1939608425,\"science\"],[879478646,\"world\"],[362076829,\"business\"],[1290383638,\"world\"],[39893848,\"world\"],[923122725,\"business\"],[1868053901,\"science\"],[-2031516895,\"technology\"],[-928747408,\"world\"],[1700442969,\"world\"],[-223316633,\"world\"],[154133607,\"world\"],[-1443018195,\"business\"],[-1729538912,\"business\"],[-236230005,\"business\"],[-1464142297,\"science\"],[-393469223,\"world\"],[1913577139,\"world\"],[-1435074445,\"business\"],[275771716,\"business\"],[625140153,\"business\"],[-1122991796,\"science\"],[352454371,\"world\"],[-933914943,\"business\"],[768893495,\"science\"],[-790796664,\"science\"],[-51772084,\"health\"],[298995080,\"world\"],[-287299404,\"business\"],[-1447564863,\"science\"],[201578775,\"world\"],[1102185599,\"world\"]],\"confusionMatrix\":[[7,0,0,1,3],[5,0,2,0,4],[0,0,3,4,4],[5,1,2,1,2],[2,0,1,1,7]],\"confusionLabels\":[\"business\",\"health\",\"science\",\"technology\",\"world\"],\"relabelingLabelMap\":[],\"accuracy\":0.32727272727272727,\"correctRelabeled\":[],\"labelingPrecision\":null,\"labelingRecall\":0,\"correctAssignedItems\":[],\"assignmentPrecision\":null,\"openedItems\":[],\"numOpenedItems\":0,\"selectedItems\":[1019667209,-1715214620,1939608425,39893848,-1443018195,625140153,352454371,1661884937,2013679196,-1402549340,621865094,2146958509],\"selectedInCategory\":7,\"selectionRecall\":0.5384615384615384},{\"modelOperation\":\"add\",\"changedFiles\":[{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"The issue was peanut butter. No matter what form it took \u2014 creamy, crunchy, straight from the jar or smeared between two slices of bread \u2014 it caused Sunny Gold enormous anxiety.\\r\\nIn fact, the gooey spread posed such a threat that during her first few years of recovery from binge eating disorder, between 2006 and 2007, Ms. Gold, 42, a communications specialist in Portland, Ore., couldn\u2019t keep it around the house. It was one of her favorite foods, and she feared she would binge on it. Just knowing it was there, lurking in her cupboard, made her feel \u201cunsafe,\u201d as she put it.\\r\\nAnd that\u2019s when things got really tricky. Because her boyfriend at the time, John Pavlus, didn\u2019t think twice about peanut butter \u2014 or any food, for that matter. When Ms. Gold, the author of \u201cFood: The Good Girl\u2019s Drug,\u201d told him that it would be a casualty of her getting healthy, he was taken aback.\\r\\n\u201cIt was a bit uncomfortable for me at first,\u201d Mr. Pavlus, a 40-year-old writer and filmmaker, admitted. He knew that Ms. Gold had grappled with binge eating since she was a teenager, but food was something they\u2019d bonded over. So when she decided that she needed to \u201ccut herself off,\u201d he felt that he was losing something, \u201cless for the practical inconvenience than the unexpected feeling of being subtly disconnected from her,\u201d he said.\\r\\n\u201cIt was strange to think of these parts of our shared reality as being so radically \u2014 to me \u2014 redefined. Is peanut butter literally dangerous now? Does that mean I have to treat it that way too? Will it be like this forever?\u201d\\r\\nMr. Pavlus\u2019s reaction is echoed by many romantic partners of someone with an eating disorder, many of whom \u2014 though certainly not all \u2014 are women. Partners often want to help, but simply don\u2019t know how.\\r\\nOr else they have no idea there\u2019s a problem, or might not recognize its severity. Because the symptoms of anorexia nervosa, bulimia or binge eating disorder can be easy to miss, even if they\u2019re accompanied by drastic weight loss or a decrease in emotional or sexual intimacy.\\r\\nThe latter, after all, can happen during any relationship. As for the former, many people, especially men, don\u2019t recognize pathological behavior when it comes to women and food.\\r\\n\u201cI had a client who said he had three sisters and they were always dieting and thought they were fat,\u201d said Cynthia Bulik, a professor of eating disorders at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, and director of the Centre for Eating Disorders Innovation at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. When the client\u2019s wife developed a full-blown eating disorder, he was blindsided. He had thought her behavior was \u201cnormal.\u201d\\r\\nIn other instances, a partner might truly not see any changes, what Gayle Lewis, a New York psychologist who specializes in eating disorders and works with couples, calls \u201cunconscious collusion.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve worked with anorexics who are incredibly thin to the point of needing hospitalization,\u201d she said. \u201cI once asked a spouse, \u2018Did you notice she was losing weight, or that her moods were changing?\u2019 His conscious response was, \u2018I see her every day, I didn\u2019t notice.\u2019 Her family didn\u2019t notice. No one confronted her about it.\u201d\\r\\nWhen he did discover the truth, he felt betrayed. Like any addiction, eating disorders involve hidden worlds that are kept secret from others. \u201cThe sense is, \u2018if you\u2019re lying to me about this, what else are you lying about?\u2019\u201d said Dr. Lewis. \\r\\nThere has been scant research focusing on romantic partners of people with eating disorders. But experts are now recognizing how critical a partner\u2019s response can be to recovery, and how partners are a critical part of treatment.\\r\\nSince the late \u201990s, family-based treatment, previously called the Maudsley approach, has been the therapy of choice for treating children and adolescents with anorexia and bulimia. But adult patients were usually treated individually. \u201cWe would never involve the partners in actual treatment,\u201d said Dr. Bulik.\\r\\nIn 2006, Dr. Bulik and Donald H. Baucom, a professor of psychology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, decided to do just that, enlisting partners in the treatment process in a study of 20 couples, one of whom had anorexia. Results showed encouraging improvements in weight-gain and a lessening of anxiety and depression along with a low dropout rate, a perennial problem when treating any kind of eating disorder.\\r\\n\u201cThat\u2019s really a significant outcome, because in other treatments up to 50 percent of people leave outpatient treatment,\u201d said Dr. Bulik. \u201cWe can\u2019t treat people if they don\u2019t come to the office.\u201d\\r\\nIn a recent study of 11 couples working with a therapist \u2014 this one focused on binge eating disorders \u2014 researchers, including Dr. Bulik and Dr. Baucom, found that by the end of the trial, after 22 weeks, 82 percent of patients had stopped binge eating, which they maintained for up to three months (the researchers had funding for only three months of follow-up). The researchers also noticed a major reduction in depression, along with a low dropout rate.\\r\\n\u201cI think it is very important to instead think about couples as dealing with the eating disorder together,\u201d said Deanna Linville, an associate professor of couples and family therapy at the University of Oregon, in Eugene. \u201cThey both need to figure out how to best support each other and connect and communicate as a team.\u201d\\r\\nThat\u2019s what Lauren and Brandon Hill learned to do. Ms. Hill, 29, met her husband in 2012, about two months after she had completed inpatient treatment for anorexia. She\u2019d been wrestling with the disorder since she was 13 and had been hospitalized for it five times.\\r\\nThroughout the years, she\u2019d been with both helpful and hurtful partners, like the college boyfriend who told her that \u201cno one is ever going to love you or deal with you.\u2019\u201d\\r\\nWhen she met Mr. Hill, she wasn\u2019t sure how he was going to react to her illness. But she decided to be honest. \u201cI told him that I had just gotten out of treatment and was seeing a dietitian and therapist and trying to get better,\u201d said Ms. Hill, of Wilmington, N.C. \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem freaked out by it.\u201d\\r\\nHe wasn\u2019t. But he was, he said, \u201cuneducated.\u201d He didn\u2019t realize how huge an impact the eating disorder had on her life, and would soon have on his.\\r\\nFor example, Mr. Hill liked to cook. But Ms. Hill didn\u2019t want anyone to cook for her; she needed to be in control of her meals. Her illness \u201climited our ability to have a variety of foods in the house,\u201d said Mr. Hill, 32, a training specialist for a software company.\\r\\nIt also prevented her from being spontaneous; she was comfortable only in certain restaurants. The few times she did allow Mr. Hill to take her out, they had to order something \u201csafe.\u201d But she didn\u2019t enjoy herself, and her husband knew it.\\r\\n\u201cI always felt really guilty,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to do these things for him, but something was just not letting me.\u201d\\r\\nSeven months into their marriage, in 2013, she checked herself into the Eating Recovery Center, in Denver, for a three month stay.\\r\\nMr. Hill did telephone sessions with her and her therapist, and also flew in to do in-person therapy. He also went to support groups with spouses of other patients, along with some patients. They would hold a question and answer period to help spouses deal with their mates. He found it helpful to ask questions that he couldn\u2019t ask his wife, like what factors they felt contributed to her eating disorders, and why she had entered treatment now.\\r\\nWhen Ms. Hill returned home, the couple tried to figure out a way to make her recovery a joint effort. On weekends they planned their weekly menu, weaving in occasional \u201cchallenge meals.\u201d After eating, they\u2019d walk their dog or watch a movie. The idea was to \u201ctake away some of the power food has over you,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, the next time it\u2019s a little less scary. It\u2019s like I took a little bit of my power back, doing it one fear food at a time.\u201d\\r\\nLast November, Ms. Hill gave birth to a baby girl, something she never imagined doing. The weight gain was difficult, she admits. \u201cFor so long I had been obsessed with controlling my body, and all of a sudden it felt so out of control,\u201d said Ms. Hill, who is now a mental health counselor in private practice.\\r\\nShe credits Mr. Hill with helping her cope with her negative feelings. \u201cMy husband is very reassuring and tells me that I am beautiful and that he loves the way I look,\u201d she said.\\r\\nAs for Ms. Gold and Mr. Pavlus, they married in 2009 and have two children. Their relationship is strong, but they had to figure out some ground rules concerning food early on. When he questioned something she ate, even if it was a simple, \u201cAre you O.K. with that?\u201d she bristled.\\r\\n\u201cIt was like, ouch, you caught me!\u201d she said. \u201cOr, are you shaming me, as other people have shamed me in the past? Are you trying to be the food police?\u201d\\r\\nBut the more they talked, the more comfortable she felt telling him what she really needed. \u201cI said, \u2018Thank you, I know you love me, but I can take care of myself. I have my therapist. You just need to trust me. Don\u2019t watch me; be there for me. It\u2019s not your job to help me not binge.\u2019\u201d\\r\\nHer responses helped him to understand where she was coming from, and also put the onus squarely on her shoulders, and not his.\\r\\n\u201cI was never made to feel like it was my responsibility to police certain foods,\u201d he said. \u201cShe asked for my support in sticking to the choices that she decided she needed to make. And, frankly, the \u2018it\u2019s not necessarily forever\u2019 felt reassuring. I didn\u2019t want to imagine us never groaning in delight together over pizza or a crazy dessert ever again, even though \u2014 of course \u2014 I\u2019d be fine with it if that\u2019s what it took.\u201d\\r\\nMs. Gold still works on her relationship with her body and practices daily mindful eating. She has \u201cslip-ups\u201d a few times a year, when she might binge. Sometimes she shares this with her husband, but sometimes not.\\r\\nPeanut butter is now allowed in the house and not only in Mr. Pavlus\u2019s home office, along with sweets that aren\u2019t hidden. It can still be fraught, especially when Mr. Pavlus is out of town and Ms. Gold is juggling work and solo parenting. During such stressful moments, \u201cSomething like marshmallows or chocolate chips just aren\u2019t a great idea to have around,\u201d she said. She doesn\u2019t want to risk eating them, but wants her husband to be able to have them.\\r\\nUltimately, Mr. Pavlus said he liked being able to help support her in her recovery in this particular way. \u201cJust recently she asked me to hide some marshmallows where she\u2019d never find them, while I was away on a business trip,\u201d said Mr. Pavlus. \u201cI did it without a second thought, and with love.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1661884937,\"description\":\"Romantic partners of someone with an eating disorder often want to help, but simply don\u2019t know how.\\r\",\"title\":\"To Treat Eating Disorders, It Sometimes Takes Two\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"health.24.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Ryan Smith spent years planning to sell shares of his software company, Qualtrics, on the stock market, meeting with bankers, carefully auditing financials and shaping a Wall Street-friendly narrative about the company\u2019s prospects. Two weeks ago, the finish line was close, with a listing on the Nasdaq just a few days away.\\r\\nBut shortly before a staff meeting to update Qualtrics\u2019 employees about the public listing, Mr. Smith received a phone call from Bill McDermott, chief executive of SAP. \u201cIt\u2019s on,\u201d Mr. McDermott told Mr. Smith.\\r\\nMr. Smith then stunned Qualtrics\u2019 workers with a totally different message: SAP had agreed to buy the company for $8 billion in cash, nearly double the valuation bankers had set for the company\u2019s public listing. It was a decision, Mr. Smith said in an interview, that he did not second-guess one bit.\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019ve never felt more peace in my life,\u201d he said.\\r\\nThat kind of last-minute deal, an increasingly common occurrence in the tech industry, is contributing to a major reshaping of the American financial landscape that has been underway for years.\\r\\nSmall and midsize companies are fading from stock markets, leaving far fewer publicly traded companies. Many of the smaller companies are bought by larger organizations or are enticed to stay private by the sharp rise in venture capital money, both of which allow them to avoid the volatility and scrutiny that come with going public. The number of listed companies peaked in the late 1990s, before the dot-com bust, plummeting 52 percent by 2016.\\r\\nThe shift leaves big companies with an outsize influence. That effect was  on display last week, as tech giants like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, whose sky-high profits had powered leading indexes on their long march up, led a retreat of major stock indexes.\\r\\nSome economists say the buyouts of early-stage companies by large dominant players help explain why, by many measures, the American economy has been less dynamic in recent years. Less competition can contribute to sluggish rates of entrepreneurship, business creation, wage growth and productivity, they say.\\r\\nTechnology companies are still going public. But Qualtrics\u2019 last-minute deal mirrored similar moves by other software companies. This year Adaptive Insights, a financial planning software company, sold to Workday two days before it was scheduled to go public. Last year, AppDynamics, a software analytics company, sold to Cisco the night before its I.P.O.\\r\\nEven some companies that do go public can find that their time there is short-lived. In March, Salesforce acquired Mulesoft, a software integration company, just a year after its public offering.\\r\\n\u201cCompanies like Qualtrics are saying, \u2018Huh, why bother the fighting in the public markets if I can do just as well by presenting myself for acquisition in sort of a premarket sale?\u2019\u201d said Andrew Karolyi, a Cornell University finance professor who has studied the decline of publicly traded companies.\\r\\nThe traditionally vibrant American small business sector was long viewed as a strength for the economy. Small businesses are more likely to develop innovative new technologies, forcing large companies to reinvest significant amounts of profits to keep pace. The economy benefits from that competition, improving productivity and generating new and higher-quality products and services for consumers.\\r\\nBut there is evidence that the competitive climate has changed. Across industries \u2014 from retailing to manufacturing to construction \u2014 start-up businesses are playing a smaller role as new companies are slower to form and employ a smaller share of America\u2019s workers.\\r\\nAt the same time, the market share of the largest companies in many industries has risen. Merger and acquisition activity is much higher than it used to be. And companies are spending less of their profits on investment than they used to.\\r\\nThe ability of large, cash-rich companies to buy smaller businesses before they have the chance to emerge as formidable competitors has altered the corporate landscape, said Thomas Philippon, a professor of economics at New York University, who has studied the increased dominance of large companies in many American industries.\\r\\n\u201cWhat would have happened to Instagram if Facebook hadn\u2019t had bought them?\u201d Mr. Philippon said. \u201cThey would have competed with Facebook for sure.\u201d\\r\\nThe technology sector has been a big part of the shift away from the public markets, including in the area of cloud computing, one of the fastest-growing corners of the industry. The abundance of private sources of capital \u2014 driven by outsize \u201cmega-rounds\u201d of funding \u2014 means start-ups can stay private longer.\\r\\nFrom 2001 to 2017, the median age of a venture-backed start-up going public was 11 years, according to a study by Jay R. Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida. That\u2019s three years older than in the 1980s and 1990s, excluding the dot-com boom.\\r\\nBig tech companies like SAP and Cisco are attracted to the reliable revenue streams of the new class of cloud-based software providers, which charge monthly subscription fees for their offerings.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s a game-changer for some of these big companies that need to adapt to a new way of doing business,\u201d said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital, a provider of I.P.O.-related research and services.\\r\\nMeanwhile, the start-ups that are bought just before a public offering get a powerful overnight lift to their planned valuations, a strong assurance in the face of a shaky stock market.\\r\\n\u201cThe public markets would not have awarded these companies those kinds of multiples,\u201d Ms. Smith said.\\r\\nWhile Qualtrics is growing quickly, its $290 million in annual revenue will not make an immediate difference in the earnings of SAP, which brought in more than $20 billion in 2017. But Mr. Smith of Qualtrics said that joining with SAP would help him accomplish in two years what would have taken five.\\r\\n\u201cOur only reason to go public was not for the financial side. It was to go take this to the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got that in one swoop.\u201d\\r\\nTraditional investors in early-stage companies that used to go public have had to adjust to the new reality. For instance, the asset manager and mutual fund company T. Rowe Price, based in Baltimore, has increased its investing activity in pre-I.P.O. companies, including Airbnb and Uber, as well as Snap, the social media company, before it went public in 2017.\\r\\n\u201cWe are seeing opportunities to invest in companies with very similar characteristics to what would have been early-stage public market companies decades ago \u2014 only these companies are oftentimes raising money through private markets instead,\u201d Corey Shull, an analyst who leads early-stage internet investments at T. Rowe Price, wrote in an email.\\r\\nInvesting in hot private start-ups is not generally available to the public. Retail investors seeking to ride the wave of hot cloud companies, for example, have had numerous opportunities to jump on an enterprise tech public offering this year.

But trying to get two Iranians and a Syrian into Trump-era America to perform a drama that is inherently sympathetic to refugees was, to put it mildly, daunting.\\r\\n\u201cThe odds were against us,\u201d said Stephen Daldry, who is directing the play alongside Justin Martin. \u201cWe knew it was going to be a challenge.\u201d\\r\\nOver several months, a coalition of celebrities (including Sting and Benedict Cumberbatch), religious leaders (the former archbishop of Canterbury) and politicians (the mayors of New York and London) joined forces in an effort to persuade the administration to grant the actors a waiver from the ban.\\r\\nOf course, there was contingency planning: An Iranian-American actor, Arian Moayed, was quietly flown to London and intensively rehearsed for a key part (he even went on one night in the ensemble) so he could replace one of the refugees in New York if need be.\\r\\nAnd then there was a zany-seeming gamble: After one of the Iranians was initially rejected by the State Department, the producers decided that, rather than try to persuade the United States to admit the Syrian actor, they would endeavor to expedite his British citizenship, thinking that would be an easier path to New York.\\r\\nIt worked. All three performers \u2014 Ammar Haj Ahmad, the Syrian refugee who successfully became a British citizen, and two Iranian refugees, Moein Ghobsheh and Yasin Moradi \u2014 were ultimately granted employment visas by the State Department, made it through airport security (Mr. Moradi was held for hours of questioning because he had once been fingerprinted while fleeing across Serbia) and are now happily rehearsing in Dumbo, Brooklyn.\\r\\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe I\u2019m in America,\u201d said Mr. Ahmad, 36, who was trained as an actor in Syria before seeking asylum in Britain, where all three men live now. \u201cIt\u2019s bizarre that we live at a time when you need all this work to get one person to another country, and amazing that it happened. But I also feel very privileged, because every day I\u2019m here, I think about the millions of people who can\u2019t go from one place to another.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cThe Jungle,\u201d cast intact, will start performances Tuesday in anticipation of a Dec. 9 opening at St. Ann\u2019s Warehouse, a prestigious and globally minded nonprofit theater on the Brooklyn waterfront. The show has an immersive set \u2014 audience members sit in a replica of an Afghan cafe at the camp, and post-show performances and talks will be held in the same geodesic dome that was used by the show\u2019s writers, Joe Murphy and Joe Robertson, when they established the Good Chance Theater at the camp in 2015. The play is scheduled to run for eight weeks, which will make it the longest-running show in the theater\u2019s history.\\r\\nMr. Ghobsheh, a 23-year-old songwriter and musician who is now using the first name Milan, and Mr. Moradi, a 26-year-old kung fu practitioner who competed on the Iranian national team, were both discovered by the theater in the Calais camp, known as the Jungle. Mr. Moradi, who is Kurdish and said he fled Iran because it had become increasingly difficult for his people, started teaching kung fu to other refugees in the Jungle, and then began performing as an actor. He said he believes in the power of the play. \u201cI think it is going to be helpful to show our story,\u201d he said.\\r\\nMatthew Covey, a Brooklyn lawyer whose firm specializes in helping international artists overcome visa problems, assembled a 160-page package of legal arguments and letters of support for St. Ann\u2019s and the refugees. Mr. Covey said performing artists have faced challenges getting visas to enter this country for years, but that the travel ban is a new, and largely untested, hurdle. In addition to Syria and Iran, it restricts travel from Libya, Yemen, Somalia, Venezuela and North Korea, and was just upheld by the Supreme Court in June, after two previous versions were overturned.\\r\\n\u201cThe issue of refugees is on everyone\u2019s mind right now,\u201d Mr. Covey said, \u201cso a powerful artistic piece coming out of that context is very compelling, and when this first came in, we said, \u2018We have to do this, and we have to make it work.\u2019\u201d\\r\\nThe case was given a push by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat whose office urged the State Department and the American Embassy in London to take a look. \u201cWelcoming refugees is what the Statue of Liberty stands for and what our nation stands for, and this play is so important because it gives refugees a chance to bring their powerful experiences to the United States,\u201d she said in a statement.\\r\\nA State Department official, who declined to be quoted by name, said he could not discuss the specifics of the \u201cJungle\u201d cases, citing \u201cvisa confidentiality.\u201d He added, though, that the government is granting waivers for people whose entry \u201cwould be in the national interest\u201d and \u201cwould not pose a threat to national security or public safety\u201d and whose prohibited entry \u201cwould cause undue hardship.\u201d\\r\\nThose are the arguments the show\u2019s promoters sought to make \u2014 saying support from the government (St. Ann\u2019s gets money from the New York State Council on the Arts) and testimonials from important cultural figures showed that the project was in the national interest. \u201cWe said, \u2018We have a story that we think people should hear, and only these people can tell it,\u2019\u201d said David Lan, the former artistic director of London\u2019s Young Vic Theater, where \u201cThe Jungle\u201d was presented before moving to the West End.\\r\\nSting and his wife, Trudie Styler, sent a letter to the American Embassy in London, arguing that \u201cthe play discusses and confronts issues and stories that are largely unreachable outside the world of art,\u201d while the former archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, called the British production \u201ca genuine national event\u201d and said, \u201cI believe that the planned production in New York will likewise be a profoundly significant event for the U.S. cultural world.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cThe Jungle\u201d is not the first production to win waivers from the travel ban, but they are rare. Rami Farah, a Syrian dancer, was issued one to perform at Cincinnati\u2019s Contemporary Arts Center. The West-Eastern Divan Orchestra said it had received waivers for musicians from Syria and Iran to join a five-city American tour. And Nassim Soleimanpour, an Iranian playwright, just got one that should allow him to come to the United States to appear in his play, \u201cNassim,\u201d which is scheduled to begin performances at New York City Center on Thursday.\\r\\nThe challenges are common enough that Mr. Moayed, a founder of the New York theater company Waterwell, said he has been called upon before to fill in for actors who might be prevented from entering the country; he also faced an issue last year when an Iranian actor was barred from traveling to New York for a Waterwell production of \u201cHamlet\u201d set in Persia, in which Mr. Moayed was starring. \u201cI knew exactly what I was walking into, because this was not the first time,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been dealing with immigration since I was a kid, so I know it\u2019s complicated, even when it\u2019s not complicated.\u201d\\r\\nBut those involved with the push to bring \u201cThe Jungle\u201d actors to New York said their success both illuminates the new obstacles for artists from restricted countries, as well as the possibility that those obstacles can be surmounted.\\r\\n\u201cPart of what makes the ending of this story really exciting is that it shows there are channels through this,\u201d Mr. Covey said. \u201cThe U.S. immigration system is obviously very connected to the current administration, but there remain ways that the value of a piece like this can be recognized and can be supported, even though it does appear to run contrary to what we hear from the top of that administration.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1482900156,\"description\":\"Two Iranians and a Syrian were allowed entry to perform \u201cThe Jungle,\u201d a play about refugees, after urgings by Sting and an ex-archbishop of Canterbury.\\r\",\"title\":\"How 3 Actors Overcame Trump\u2019s Travel Ban to Take the New York Stage\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"world.20.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Want climate news in your inbox?

The blackouts and other energy disruptions of Hurricane Harvey were just harbingers, the report said. Across the United States, every element of the country\u2019s energy infrastructure, like oil wells and nuclear power plants, will be stressed by droughts, heat waves, rising seas and fiercer storms.\\r\\n\u201cClimate change disrupts everything, including Trump\u2019s agenda,\u201d said Alice Hill, a research fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution think tank who served as senior director for resilience policy on the National Security Council under President Barack Obama.\\r\\nWhen it comes to fossil fuel production, the disruptions are particularly serious. And there\u2019s a fundamental irony at play. Even as emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are warming the planet, the consequences of that warming will make it harder to drill for oil, mine for coal and deliver fuel through pipelines.\\r\\nMr. Trump wants to boost oil and gas drilling on public lands in the West, but drought is expected to affect the water necessary for hydraulic fracturing, the technique of injecting vast amounts of liquid into the bedrock to force out natural gas or oil. In the Arctic, where Mr. Trump has plans to open sensitive areas to oil drilling, equipment built to withstand Alaska\u2019s freezing temperatures is particularly vulnerable to permafrost melting as the state warms at twice the rate of the rest of the country. \\r\\nCoal-burning power plants are at risk as well. Rising temperatures from extreme heat events, the report notes, are expected to reduce their capacity to generate power and hamper the efficiency of the transmission grid.\\r\\nThe national climate report, mandated by Congress and made public by the White House, makes the case that global warming \u201cis transforming where and how we live and presents growing challenges to human health.\u201d Soon after publication, however, President Trump and several members of his cabinet disavowed it. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the findings. \\r\\nPresident Trump\u2019s call for energy dominance has been a central ambition of his administration. He hit on the slogan in the early days of his presidency, predicting a \u201cgolden era of American energy\u201d that would be asserted via the country\u2019s booming natural gas, coal and petroleum exports.\\r\\nCabinet officials have taken up the mantra. \\r\\nInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke in announcing last year a lease sale of nearly 80 million acres of federal waters off the Gulf of Mexico, described it as \u201ca pillar of President Trump\u2019s plan to make the United States energy dominant.\u201d Energy Secretary Rick Perry has described energy dominance as \u201cexporting freedom,\u201d particularly by delivering America\u2019s liquefied natural gas and developing offshore oil drilling. \\r\\nEven at the Environmental Protection Agency, where the core mission is to ensure clean air and water, Andrew Wheeler, the acting administrator, has heralded ways he and his staff have advanced the president\u2019s energy dominance agenda by saving polluting industries billions of dollars in regulatory costs.\\r\\nThe findings from the National Climate Assessment, issued by 13 federal agencies, come as the new House Democratic majority prepares to conduct oversight next year into Mr. Trump\u2019s rollbacks of federal climate change policies. Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, who is expected to chair the House Science Committee, is part of a group of lawmakers planning two days of hearings in January into ways to both reduce planet-warming emissions and prepare for the consequences of rising temperatures.\\r\\n\u201cOur rapidly changing climate, and the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to take us in the wrong direction, seriously jeopardize our future,\u201d Ms. Johnson said.\\r\\nEnergy infrastructure is an expensive part of the problem, according to the assessment. The report does not provide firm estimates of expected costs. It does cite the fact that Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which resulted in gasoline lines stretching for miles, inoperable refineries and electricity outages affecting 8.7 million people, prodded utility companies in New York and New Jersey to invest billions of dollars in upgrades like elevating equipment and redesigning electrical networks to withstand extreme weather.\\r\\nThe report notes that Con Edison and Public Service Electric and Gas have invested about $2 billion in repairs in response to recent hurricanes. It also points out that the costs to reconstruct Puerto Rico\u2019s electricity systems in the wake of Hurricanes Irma and Maria are estimated around $17 billion. \\r\\nAnd while the report notes that energy companies and utilities are increasingly taking steps to harden their infrastructure \u2014 like planning for sea-level rise when building infrastructure \u2014 experts said the federal government needs to do more.\\r\\n\u201cWhen you lose access to energy, your entire economy grinds to a halt,\u201d said Jason Bordoff, director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University and a former White House energy adviser to President Obama during Hurricane Sandy. \\r\\n\u201cThe report lays out clearly the extent to which so many aspects of the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure are at risk from climate change,\u201d Mr. Bordoff said.\\r\\nEnergy systems in the Southeast are particularly vulnerable, the report said, with some 200 power plants and oil refineries exposed to flooding from hurricanes and fiercer storm surges. Scientists estimate, if sea levels rise nationally 3.3 feet (a figure it describes as on the \u201chigh end of the very likely range\u201d for what the country could see by 2100), it could expose dozens of power plants currently considered to be in safe zones to risks of 100-year floods. That would jeopardize about 25 gigawatts of operating power capacity, or power for about 18 million homes.\\r\\nAlong the Gulf Coast \u2014 home to a significant proportion of the United States oil production and refining industry \u2014 energy infrastructure faces a similar and more immediate risk. A sea level rise of less than 1.6 feet could double the number of refineries in Texas and Louisiana vulnerable to flooding by the end of the century.\\r\\nYet energy analysts cautioned against expectations that the effects of climate change will cause irreparable harm to the fossil fuel industry or make oil, gas and coal production fundamentally unattractive to investors. Sarah Ladislaw, an energy analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noted that the oil and gas sector has a long history of managing risks, including figuring out how to operate in politically unstable countries and prodding governments to loosen regulations they find too burdensome.\\r\\nClimate change will add \u201cheadwinds\u201d to fossil fuel companies, make production more costly in some areas and less competitive in others, Ms. Ladislaw said. But, she added, \u201cIf you\u2019re waiting for climate impacts to be the end of the oil and gas industry, that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d\\r\\nFor more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1578760520,\"description\":\"Rising temperatures undermine the president\u2019s vision of an energy-dominant America, affecting coal-fired power plants, oil production and the electrical grid, a federal report says.\\r\",\"title\":\"Trump\u2019s \u2018Energy Dominance\u2019 Doctrine Is Undermined by Climate Change\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.22.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"For the past three months, Gjermund Roesholt and his family lived far off the grid in the Yukon, the vast, desolate Canadian territory where wildlife outnumbers humans. They traded life in the city for a cabin on Einarson Lake, a remote speck of water amid snow-capped mountains, and spent their waking hours fur trapping.\\r\\nOn Monday afternoon, Mr. Roesholt had almost finished the return trek from his trapline to the family\u2019s cabin when a grizzly bear appeared and charged him, the authorities said. He pulled out a gun and killed the bear, but soon discovered a gruesome sight: Outside the cabin were the bodies of his wife, Valerie Theoret, 37, and their daughter, Adele Roesholt, who was 10 months old.\\r\\nThey had been mauled to death by a bear, most likely the same one Mr. Roesholt shot, the Canadian authorities said.\\r\\nIn the Yukon, it is common for people and bears to interact, both in the wild and in towns, where the animals sometimes venture and rummage through trash for food. But it is not normal for the interactions to turn violent, let alone fatal. In the past 20 years, only three people in the territory have been killed by bears, according to the Yukon Department of Environment.\\r\\nThe deaths of Ms. Theoret, a sixth-grade French-immersion teacher who was on maternity leave, and Adele have stunned fellow trappers and those in Whitehorse, a close-knit city of 25,000 people where the family lived full time. So many people in the city, the Yukon\u2019s largest, have been shaken by the attack that therapists and psychologists were brought in for counseling at a communitywide event on Thursday.\\r\\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s a tragedy,\u201d said Isabelle Salesse, who is the executive director of the Association Franco-Yukonnaise, an organization in Whitehorse that supports French-speaking Yukon residents and causes, and who knew Ms. Theoret. \u201cThat her baby was with her and died as well, it\u2019s even worse.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Roesholt could not be reached for comment.\\r\\nMs. Theoret, who was on leave from Whitehorse Elementary School, had taught hundreds of students over the years and was well liked by parents, Ms. Salesse said. The Yukon Department of Education called her a \u201cvalued educator.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cThis tragedy weighs heavy on our hearts as a community and in times such as these, we will come together to honor her memory and support each other,\u201d the department said in a statement.\\r\\nAfter killing the bear and discovering the bodies, the police said, Mr. Roesholt activated a satellite-connected emergency device that alerted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in the tiny village of Mayo, Yukon, which is 130 miles west of Einarson Lake. The site of the family\u2019s cabin, tucked among spruce and birch trees in the Yukon River Basin near the territory\u2019s border with the Northwest Territories, does not have cellphone reception and is accessible only by helicopter or plane.\\r\\nWhile the Royal Canadian Mounted Police responded to the scene, the lead investigative agency is the territory\u2019s Department of Environment. The department looks into deaths caused by animals, suggesting that the police do not suspect foul play was involved.\\r\\nMr. Roesholt, who owns a wildlife and hunting guide company, was approved to lease the trapline and the cabin on two and a half acres by the lake, which is stocked with grayling fish, in October 2015, according to government records. In his application, he said his family would arrive by air and noted that the most dominant animals in the area were moose and grizzly bears.\\r\\nOn the couple\u2019s fur business website, they showcased a variety of fur items they made from animals they caught in the Yukon, including gloves with beaver fur and scarves with lynx fur.\\r\\nMr. Roesholt wrote that he grew up in Norway and began hunting and trapping at age 4 with his father and grandfather, catching marten and fox. Their website describes Mr. Roesholt as the \u201cwild guide and consultant,\u201d while Ms. Theoret was the \u201cdesigner and artisan of the fur products.\u201d\\r\\nThe couple\u2019s trapline at Einarson Lake had been approved for catching many animals but was mainly used for marten, a small mammal prized for its dense, soft fur.\\r\\nThe trapping season in the Yukon for most animals, including beavers, foxes and wolverines, starts in November every year. There are 350 traplines in Yukon, which are regulated by the government, and about 200 active fur trappers this season, according to the Yukon Trappers Association.\\r\\nConservation officers at the Department of Environment, as well as the Yukon coroner\u2019s office, were expected to complete a necropsy of the grizzly bear soon, said Roxanne Stasyszyn, a department spokeswoman. The investigation will try to determine whether the grizzly killed by Mr. Roesholt was the same that attacked his family, and whether it was prompted because it felt threatened or because it saw the mother and child as prey.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that the further you go from the community, the more in bear habitat you\u2019ll tread,\u201d said Ms. Stasyszyn, who added that encounters with bears occur far more frequently than bear attacks.\\r\\n\u201cThey are not very common,\u201d she said.\\r\\nThe last killing of a human by a bear in the Yukon was in October 2014, when a bear broke into a Canadian couple\u2019s cabin and mauled a woman. In April 2006, an employee at a mining company accidentally walked into a bear den, and a mother bear killed him. In July 1996, a young bear found a campsite along a popular hiking trail and fatally attacked a woman who tried to play dead, believing it would cause the bear to leave her alone.\\r\\nAcross Canada, there are 30,000 grizzly bears, according to the latest estimates, and the largest population is believed to be in the Yukon. They are generally the most feared bear, along with polar bears, in Canada and can react aggressively when they see humans.\\r\\nAndy McMullen, a bear safety consultant in Canada, said the grizzly attack in the Yukon was especially surprising because it occurred during a time of the year when bears typically retreat to their dens to hibernate for the winter. Bears in some parts of the country, depending on the climate, begin hibernation around the start of November, he said.\\r\\n\u201cSurprise encounters are typically the cause of grizzly bear attacks,\u201d said Mr. McMullen, who lives in the Northwest Territories.\\r\\nMr. McMullen, who is not involved in the investigation, said it seemed likely that the grizzly bear started to charge Mr. Roesholt because it was trying to keep him away from the two bodies. \u201cIt\u2019s defending its kill,\u201d he said.\\r\\nIf someone encounters a bear, Mr. McMullen said, it is best to stand still and then slowly retreat from the bear. The animals are more impatient than humans and are more likely to run off, he said.\\r\\nThe bear\u2019s body language also dictates the best response, said Ms. Stasyszyn of the Department of Environment. If the bear is merely protecting its space, back away in hopes that the bear understands you are not a threat. But if the bear is aggressive and shows signs that it will attack, act large, be loud and fight back, she said.\\r\\nDo not play dead in that situation, she added, because you will be an easy target. \u201cIt\u2019s the wrong thing to do,\u201d she said.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-559492105,\"description\":\"Gjermund Roesholt shot the bear near a remote cabin where he had been living with his wife, Valerie Theoret, and their 10-month-old daughter, Adele.\\r\",\"title\":\"Fur Trapper Kills Grizzly Bear After His Wife and Baby Were Mauled in the Yukon\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.21.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"The former director of the F.B.I., James B.

Hall, a trader and a prolific art collector, $465,000.\\r\\nThe lawyer for the Gascards, William B. Pribis, had no comment and said no decision had been made about an appeal. But the finding seemed to end a saga that began when Mr. Hall, who had amassed a fortune with canny trades in oil markets, started building a personal art collection, including many works by Golub, an American postwar painter whose art explored dire political conditions with expressionistic, heroic-scale figures. Mr. Hall believed Golub\u2019s work was undervalued and due to appreciate.\\r\\n[Read more about the case.]\\r\\nFrom 2009 to 2011, Mr. Hall bought 24 paintings from the Gascards, including several at Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s auction houses in New York, one on an online auction site, and 16 directly from the Gascards after Nikolas Gascard reached out and made contact with Mr. Hall.\\r\\nBut Mr. Hall became suspicious in 2015 when he set out to stage an exhibition of Golub\u2019s art at the private rural museum he established near his home in Reading, Vt.\\r\\nA foundation established to promote work by Golub and his wife, the artist Nancy Spero, examined the paintings and found problems, including no record of the Gascard Golubs in the foundation\u2019s database and \u201ca number of unusual formal characteristics during in-person examinations of the paintings,\u201d according to court papers.\\r\\nThe Gascards denied the paintings were fakes. Ms. Gascard said that she had gotten to know Golub while attending his classes at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Teaneck, N.J., in the late 1970s, and that they had become close friends until his death in 2004.\\r\\nShe and her son told the court that Golub had given her some works and that members of her family who lived in Germany had separately collected Golubs, which the Gascards found and retrieved following their relatives\u2019 deaths. Mr. Gascard did admit to making up titles and dates for some of the paintings, saying in a deposition that he had arrived at the dates based \u201con my research and the style of painting,\u201d according to The Keene Sentinel.\\r\\nMr. Hall\u2019s lawyer, Ted Poretz, called to the stand a Golub expert, Jon Bird, a professor emeritus at Middlesex University in London, who testified that the works Mr. Hall was sold demonstrated clear differences with Golub\u2019s style.\\r\\nShowing some of the works to the jurors, Professor Bird said that the dates of the works did not match Golub\u2019s style at that time and that they did not appear to have been made with Golub\u2019s familiar scraping technique. Instead, the paint had been layered on, Mr. Poretz said.\\r\\nProfessor Bird also said the depiction of human forms did not share the same nuance that Golub was known for, Mr. Poretz said.\\r\\nAt Franklin Pierce, Ms. Gascard taught undergraduate art history and drawing and supervised the college art gallery. An artist herself, practicing a technique called rust art, she often walked around campus wearing white gloves and dark glasses, faculty colleagues said. She left Franklin Pierce in 2015 after an unrelated dispute with the administration.\\r\\nMs. Gascard said that she did not paint, but a former neighbor came forward at the last minute, testifying at the trial that she had often smelled paint and had seen painting tools and unfinished paintings in the basement she shared with Ms. Gascard, Mr. Hall said.\\r\\nIn an interview, Mr. Hall said that even though some people wondered why he had wanted to draw attention to the fact that he had been tricked, he said he was glad he had pursued the case and now felt vindicated. \u201cPeople thought maybe I was rash and should put it down to one of life\u2019s rich experiences,\u201d he said. \u201cBut people defrauding other people, especially in the art market, should not be allowed to get away with it.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Hall said that though he was satisfied because he was getting his money back, \u201cI am even happier for Leon Golub and his legacy that was being impaired by this whole business.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cI hope it\u2019s cleared the air,\u201d he said.\\r\\nMr. Hall earned his fortune making large bets in commodities markets. In 2009, at the helm of Phibro, part of Citigroup, he was set to receive a $100 million bonus. That became a flash point for national anger over executive pay at a time when Citigroup had accepted bailout money from the federal government after the financial crisis.\\r\\nIn the interview, he said he did not know what he was going to do with the Gascard paintings. \u201cProbably have a big bonfire,\u201d Mr. Hall said.\\r\\nThe jury found for Mr. Hall\u2019s claim against Nikolas Gascard for fraud, and against both Nikolas and Lorettann Gascard for conspiracy to defraud.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1061519995,\"description\":\"A federal jury in New Hampshire ordered a former professor and her son to repay Andrew J.

In an exhibition recounting Myanmar\u2019s martial history, his photo is at the top of a pyramid of 32 framed shots of other military leaders.\\r\\nIn other halls, his image hangs alone.\\r\\nFor years, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, one of the most powerful people in Myanmar, presided over ruthless campaigns targeting minority groups along Myanmar\u2019s borders.\\r\\nUnder his charge, the military drove out more than 700,000 Rohingya from the country\u2019s west.\\r\\nAn important part of the campaign against the Rohingya was waged on Facebook, and the general, along with other military leaders, used troll farms and fake accounts to seed ethnic hatred and build support for what the United Nations has called \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201d\\r\\nNow, though, the general has been driven off Facebook; the company shut down his accounts in August.\\r\\nYet the museum remains \u2014 a kind of Facebook profile for his accomplishments, and those of the military.\\r\\n\u201cI think the military wanted to build this massive museum to show off its guardianship of the country,\u201d said U Ye Myo Hein, an executive director at the Tagaung Institute of Political Studies in Yangon, Myanmar\u2019s largest city. \u201cBut it\u2019s also a sign of their megalomania.\u201d\\r\\nThe museum sits in the country\u2019s capital, Naypyidaw, itself an even larger show of the military\u2019s long legacy of almost unlimited power in the country.\\r\\nBuilt from scratch in the early 2000s when the military junta held full power, the city was carved out of an expanse of scrubland nestled between two mountain ranges in the center of the country.\\r\\nIn 2005, with little warning, the military announced that the artificial city would become the country\u2019s new capital, even though it was still a construction site. Bureaucrats dutifully picked up and relocated to a half-complete city that lacked basic amenities.\\r\\nSome have theorized that the new city was created as a safeguard against invasion, and also protests. It has remained the seat of political power, even as the military stepped back and allowed for elections that paved the way for the country\u2019s partial democracy.\\r\\nFifteen years on, Naypyidaw is a reminder that although the country now has the veneer of democracy, the military retains true power. Much in the city is a testament to its authority and its desire to shape how it is perceived.\\r\\nThe monumental buildings seem designed to impress, but mostly they accentuate an overwhelming lack of people.\\r\\nThe roads in the city, which in places swell to 16 lanes, would seem unnecessarily huge even with a crush of vehicles, but there is almost no traffic at all, at rush hour or anytime. Motor scooters easily outnumber cars.\\r\\nDriving down them feels like cruising on a runway instead of a highway, and many seem like alternate landing strips for the country\u2019s Air Force in case of war.\\r\\nThe Parliament complex, a series of giant concrete structures, has the air of a fortress, with the reservoir surrounding it resembling a moat.\\r\\nA gilded pagoda towers over the nearby jungle. A replica of the country\u2019s famed Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, it stands just a tad shorter than the original to show a smidgen of deference to the sacred Buddhist monument.\\r\\nThe military has a self-appointed role as a protector of Buddhism, the majority religion in this country with Muslim and Christian minorities.\\r\\nYet even in a city filled with reminders of the military\u2019s might, the country\u2019s sprawling Defense Services Museum, set on 600 acres, perhaps best showcases the mind-set of a military force preoccupied with its reputation and showing off its power. Unofficial estimates of the museum\u2019s floor space put its size at around 540,000 square feet, not much smaller than the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.\\r\\n\u201cThere are military museums in other countries, but the one in Naypyidaw is way too big in comparison,\u201d Mr. Ye Myo Hein said.\\r\\nA dozen display halls, each easily as big as a football field, show off bombs, mines, machine guns, mortars, warplanes and artillery. Photos of military leaders saluting and congratulating one another are everywhere.\\r\\nElaborate dioramas portray optimistic versions of the military\u2019s capabilities. One demonstrating the military\u2019s communications capabilities includes a tiny model of an aircraft carrier. Myanmar\u2019s Navy has no aircraft carrier.\\r\\nLess overtly militaristic mementos abound, too \u2014 like a soccer ball from when Myanmar\u2019s national team was ably coached by a colonel, and a plaque from the U.S.S. North Carolina Battleship Commission, sent in thanks for Myanmar\u2019s help supplying teak to replace the decks of the World War II-era ship.\\r\\nBut aside from groups of soldiers, whose visits are likely mandatory, there are not many people to admire these artifacts. On a recent visit, museum staff members easily outnumbered the civilians wandering the halls, mostly monks in small groups. One attendant said the museum typically has just a few visitors each day, with an occasional school group.\\r\\nNine Burmese political analysts contacted said they couldn\u2019t talk about the museum \u2014 because none had been there.\\r\\nA military representative declined to discuss details of the museum.\\r\\nFor decades the military used newspapers, radio and television to spread propaganda. In the museum\u2019s wing dedicated to psychological warfare, a to-scale model of a television studio recalled those efforts.\\r\\nNew technology has both threatened, and amplified, those abilities. As Facebook began to proliferate in the country in 2012, many voices on the platform were anti-military.\\r\\nBut Myanmar\u2019s military quickly recognized Facebook\u2019s potential as a convenient way to connect to people, making it an important new tool in an ongoing information war, even if its senior general is no longer allowed on the site.\\r\\n\u201cFacebook is great for propaganda,\u201d said U Myat Thu, a researcher who works to combat hate speech on the site.\\r\\nAnd while the museum may struggle to attract visitors, the military has figured out how to draw crowds to a far more accessible location: the internet.\\r\\n\u201cNo one watches military television or reads their newspaper,\u201d Mr. Myat Thu said. \u201cBut they do look at social media.

The main one being, how did he get to be 6 feet 4 inches at the shoulder, and weigh about 3,000 pounds, so big that he escaped the abattoir. The answer seems to be if you\u2019re a good-sized Holstein steer and you live long enough, you too could be a contender. \\r\\nWhat are Holsteins? \\r\\nThey are the Ben and Jerry cows, black and white. They are bred to produce milk. The breed is 2,000 years old and originated in Europe. They are also raised for their meat, and, since Knickers was a steer (a castrated bull), he unfortunately had no future in the dairy business.\\r\\nHow big do cattle usually grow?\\r\\nIt depends on the breed. According to Daren M. Sheffield, production records specialist at the Holstein Association USA, the average Holstein cow is about 4 feet, 10 inches tall at the shoulder and weighs about 1,500 pounds. Steers are usually slaughtered around 15 months at a weight of 1,300 to 1,400 pounds. It is rare for a steer to reach seven years of age. \\r\\nBut, Mr. Sheffield said, \u201cSteers can grow to tremendous sizes at a mature age. It was not uncommon for Holstein cattle raised as oxen to reach weights of 3,000 pounds.\u201d Oxen are steers raised for work like plowing.\\r\\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\\r\\nAnd what about bulls?\\r\\nMr. Sheffield said the averages for Holstein bulls are less well known, but they do reach 6 feet and weigh up to 2500 pounds. \u201cMature steers such as Knickers can reach heavier weights than the average bull,\u201d he said.\\r\\nBulls of other breeds can grow a lot bigger, though. A few years ago, Britain\u2019s biggest bull, of a different breed, was 7 feet tall and weighed 4,000 pounds. \\r\\nWhat determines size for cattle?\\r\\nGenes contribute to size, but exactly which genes and how is not clear. In humans, there are many genes and genomic regions involved in determining height. In dogs, a few regions predominate.\\r\\nAn analysis earlier this year of cattle genomes concluded that cattle are more like humans than dogs. The researchers looked at genetic data from almost 60,000 cattle and found 163 gene variants contributing to height. All those gene areas accounted for less than 14 percent of height variation. Other contributors to size are food, environment and age. \\r\\n\\r\\nHow unusual is a 6-foot-4 Holstein?\\r\\nIn 2016, the Daily Mail in Britain featured a Holstein steer in California named Daniel that was purported to be 6 feet 4 inches tall. \\r\\nA Holstein named Blossom, who died in 2015 at the age of 13, is still listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the tallest cow ever at 6 foot 2.8 inches. Also in 2016, the Daily Mail, which seems to love large bovines, had a story on Big Moo, then considered perhaps the biggest steer.

As the cells proliferate, they secrete a chemical that causes the bone marrow to fill with scar tissue (\u201cfibrosis\u201d). \\r\\nThe remaining normal myeloid cells evacuate to safer territory in the spleen, and the spleen swells, squashing the nearby stomach but making the abdomen look overly full. Consequently, the person with the disease becomes progressively malnourished from an inability to take in enough calories. My patient had lost 25 pounds in the preceding six months as a result, even as her waistline expanded and made her feel uncomfortable, even unwieldy from her new girth.\\r\\nI had prescribed the one drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for such conditions, and it worked well for her: Her spleen shrank back to a normal size, she gained back some weight, and she had resumed having a good quality of life.\\r\\nBut the drug is not curative, and when I saw her again recently, she told me she had lost her appetite, she had dropped a few pounds, and I noticed that she was wearing pants with an elastic waistband, to accommodate her swelling abdomen.\\r\\n\u201cI figured the medicine had stopped working,\u201d she told me. \u201cI try to take in a few small meals over the course of the day, but I always feel full and can only eat but so much.\u201d\\r\\nI nodded sympathetically. We discussed the paucity of available treatment options and settled on a clinical trial of a new oral drug that had shown promise in preliminary studies. She asked me about the side effects of the medication.\\r\\nI told her that any drug used to treat her myelofibrosis has the potential of making her blood counts worse, meaning she would be at higher risk of bleeding or infections and might need transfusions.\\r\\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been used in enough patients with your diagnosis yet to identify side effects that are rarer,\u201d I said, having reviewed the clinical trial protocol before I talked with her. \u201cFor the same reason, I can\u2019t tell you precisely how well it will work, though in previous studies between one-quarter and one-third of patients had symptoms that improved.\u201d\\r\\nShe nodded. \u201cWell, we have to do something to try and make me feel better. Let\u2019s go for it.\u201d\\r\\nShe returned to our cancer center for screening laboratory studies, and once we confirmed that she was eligible for the trial, we gave her a bottle of pills to start taking and she went back home.\\r\\nA few days later, the research nurse poked her head into my office with news about our patient.\\r\\n\u201cDid you hear? She was admitted to her local hospital.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding!\u201d I said in disbelief. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\\r\\n\u201cShe felt lightheaded and went to the E.R. I think she had a bleed in her abdomen. You can check her labs and scans on the computer.\u201d\\r\\nOur patients\u2019 medical records, as is the case at many hospitals, are all electronic, and have been so for about 15 years. As more and more hospitals have adopted electronic medical records, their records have become linked with ours, and we can now see results of laboratory and radiology tests performed elsewhere, enabling better continuity of care.\\r\\nI accessed her medical record and reviewed her lab results in a hospital 130 miles away. She was anemic and her white blood cell count had quintupled.\\r\\n\u201cDo you think the trial drug caused this?\u201d the research nurse asked. \u201cOr did her myelofibrosis get worse?\u201d\\r\\nI couldn\u2019t tell. I found a note from the E.R. doctor mentioning a CT scan that showed blood in her belly, but the actual scan results were still pending.\\r\\nI logged back into the computer an hour later. The CT report, now available, showed active bleeding in her abdomen. I also saw a series of orders for platelet transfusions. Good \u2014 that\u2019s what I would have done.\\r\\nA couple of hours later, I read that she was transferred to the intensive care unit. They were giving her fluids for her low blood pressure. Then, her labs revealed a problem in her ability to form blood clots, which would make it hard to stem the bleeding. She was given clotting factors to help.\\r\\nI felt as if, in starting her medication, I had launched a drone carrying aircraft ordnance and, like the military personnel who control these devices, was now remotely watching the havoc that its missiles had wrought. The substance of who my patient was had been reduced to blips on a screen detailing abnormal laboratory values, complicated medical terms like \u201cdisseminated intravascular coagulopathy,\u201d and clipped, cautionary phrases in the doctor and nursing notes.\\r\\nA nephrology consult was called for kidney failure. My patient was deteriorating in real time, on the computer.\\r\\nThe following day, she was transferred to our hospital. As I was about to leave my office to go see her, the research nurse stopped me. My patient had a cardiac arrest a couple of hours after her arrival and had died.\\r\\nMy initial instinct was to turn back to my computer and read the death note in her electronic medical record, the disembodied source of truth about her for the past 48 hours.\\r\\nBut it was no substitute for the person I had come to know over years.\\r\\nRecognizing the foolishness of looking for the death note, I stopped myself and instead locked eyes with the research nurse for a few seconds.

Those meetings will start on Monday.\\r\\nA third weekend of nationwide protests by the movement, largely made up of working-class people angry about a planned increase in fuel taxes and their dwindling purchasing power, left burned cars and smashed store windows in several of the wealthiest neighborhoods of Paris. The movement is named for the high-visibility safety vests that motorists are supposed to wear when they have roadside breakdowns.\\r\\nBroken glass and empty tear gas canisters fired by the police littered the city, where hundreds of vandals joined the ranks of the protesters. One person died in the unrest this weekend outside Paris, bringing to three the number of casualties on the margins of the demonstrations over the last three weekends of protests.\\r\\nMore than 260 people were wounded nationwide, at least 133 of them in Paris, according to the prefecture of police. Some were bystanders caught in the fray who needed treatment after exposure to tear gas. About 412 people were arrested nationwide.\\r\\nThe prefect of Paris, Michel Delpuech, said at a news conference late Sunday that the police had been faced with \u201cextreme and unprecedented violence\u201d and that protesters had thrown hammers and steel ball bearings at them.\\r\\nFirefighters extinguished nearly 250 blazes that destroyed 112 cars and burned other property, including several buildings. The cost of the damage was being assessed on Sunday.\\r\\nAmong those arrested were largely men in their 30s and 40s, some from the far right and some from the far left, but also \u201ca number of protesters wearing yellow vests\u201d who did not hesitate to join the fray, said R\u00e9my Heitz, the Paris prosecutor.\\r\\nThe interior minister, Christophe Castaner, said on Sunday that he would not rule out the president\u2019s declaring a state of emergency, but by day\u2019s end that appeared less likely, at least for the time being. The president has emergency powers that were expanded after the terrorist attacks of November 2015.\\r\\n\u201cIt is out of the question that each weekend becomes a ritual of violence,\u201d a government spokesman, Benjamin Griveaux, said in an interview on Europe 1.\\r\\nThe \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace said on Sunday that Mr. Macron would not comment on the protests.\\r\\nMr. Macron visited one of the worst-hit streets, the Avenue Kl\u00e9ber, where about a third of the stores were vandalized and all of the ATMs were smashed. He was both booed and cheered.\\r\\nHe also inspected the damage to the Arc de Triomphe, where supporters of the Yellow Vests had scrawled messages. He climbed to the top of the monument, as some of the Yellow Vests had done on Saturday night; it was now ringed with hundreds of police officers and special riot squads.\\r\\nThe graffiti seemed targeted at Mr. Macron, who has been described as the \u201cpresident of the rich.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cThe Yellow Vests Will Triumph\u201d and \u201cMacron Quit,\u201d read two of the scrawls. Others reported in Le Monde, France\u2019s leading newspaper, said: \u201cTopple the bourgeoisie,\u201d \u201cWe cut off heads for less than this\u201d and \u201cMay 1968, December 2018.\u201d\\r\\nThe last message appeared to link the current protests with the nationwide strikes and fights with the police in 1968 that resulted in major social changes and compromises with workers.\\r\\nThe protesters\u2019 anger was visible in the many streets that fan out from the Arc de Triomphe, which dominates one end of the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, and along several other commercial avenues, where looters had broken windows, burned cars and built barricades. Vandals also targeted the wealthy area around the Church of Saint-Augustin, just off Avenue Haussmann, a major shopping street with famous department stores like Au Printemps and Galeries Lafayette.\\r\\nThe flagship Chanel store windows were shattered, as were those of several supermarkets. Looters appeared to have stolen beer from a grocery store on Avenue Hoche, leaving the bottles and boxes on the street. Planters had been dragged from cafes, overturned and used as barricades.\\r\\nProtesters in other French cities also turned to violence, injuring police officers and setting fires. Affected cities included Bourdeaux, Nantes and Toulouse, although none were damaged as much as Paris.\\r\\nOf those arrested, 378 were still being held late Sunday for questioning. The Interior Ministry said protests this weekend had drawn 136,000 people nationwide, slightly down from the 166,000 who gathered last week.\\r\\nPoliticians and law enforcement officials alike said that the situation was close to an \u201cinsurrection.\u201d\\r\\nAlthough the government has made no sign of reversing course on the gas tax increase that precipitated the most recent protests or of reducing other taxes, some of the Yellow Vests indicated that they were ready to negotiate.\\r\\nIt is difficult to determine who represents the movement, which has no official leader or membership. But a group of 10 representatives wrote an opinion piece in the Journal du Dimanche, a weekly newspaper, calling for negotiations with the government.\\r\\nThey called for an \u201cimmediate and unconditional freeze in the tax increase on fuel\u201d as well as the cancellation of new and more rigorous vehicle inspection rules, which raise costs for drivers. They also asked to change the electoral system to one of proportional representation, which would benefit smaller parties, including those on the far left and far right.\\r\\nJean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the leader of the far left, and Marine Le Pen, his counterpart on the far right, both called for the dissolution of the National Assembly. Such a move would force the government to call parliamentary elections, putting Mr. Macron\u2019s majority at risk.\\r\\n\u201cWe are in a situation that is almost insurrectional,\u201d Mr. M\u00e9lenchon said in an interview on BFM-TV, a major network. \u201cThese are pages in the history of France comparable to 1968. Everything must be dealt with by having a larger perspective.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cThe president has chosen the worst: counting on the degradation\u201d of the Yellow Vest movement, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon added, berating the president for not meeting with representatives of the protesters on Sunday.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-306042904,\"description\":\"After a summit meeting in Argentina, President Emmanuel Macron surveyed the destruction left after the \u201cYellow Vest\u201d protests.\\r\",\"title\":\"Macron Returns to Turmoil, as France Weighs State of Emergency\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"world.23.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.__________\\r\\n\u201cType A Behavior and Your Heart,\u201d a 1970s best-selling book, claimed that heart disease was more likely among people who were involved in an \u201caggressive and incessant struggle to achieve more and more in less and less time.\u201d The connection with cardiac health has been questioned. But many managers could do with a different title: \u201cType A Behavior and Your Soul.\u201d Carlos Ghosn would be the prime exhibit.\\r\\nThe 64-year-old former multinational chief executive, now sitting in a Japanese jail, is the ultimate Type A personality. He hardly sleeps, pushed his way to the top of two large and troubled car companies \u2014 first Renault and then Nissan \u2014 and energetically broke a series of corporate and national industrial taboos to bring them to good health. He even acquired a nickname suited to a business action-movie superhero: \u201cLe Cost Killer.\u201d\\r\\nIt looks like Mr. Ghosn was too bold. Despite reported annual remuneration of close to $20 million, he stands accused of not disclosing his full Nissan pay. According to Japanese press reports, he also bought property in Lebanon and Brazil with company money, among other alleged transgressions.\\r\\nMr. Ghosn is in custody and has not spoken publicly about the allegations. But even if he did not break any rules, the disclosures suggest that an enormously successful, almost universally lauded and hugely wealthy executive thought he deserved more than a sum which looks absurdly high to most people.\\r\\nIt looks like a dismal end for a glorious career. The sudden reversal of fortune makes Mr. Ghosn something of a tragic hero. Here is a great man whose greatness is inseparable from a devastating character flaw.\\r\\nThe combination of greatness and great weakness is fairly common among successful chief executives. From General Electric\u2019s Jack Welch to film mogul Harvey Weinstein, the careers of many of the most dynamic and successful bosses have been tarnished by scandals of excess pay, sexual intimidation or reckless risk-taking.\\r\\nThe tragic curse is closely connected to the professional blessing. The restless confidence and endless desire to get things done which leads to breaking established corporate patterns and reshaping cultures can sometimes also lead to inappropriate efforts to satisfy what the Bible calls the \u201cthe lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life\u201d \u2014 the desire for inordinate quantities of sex, money and power.\\r\\nIn other words, Type-A transgressions that initially spur corporate success can easily slip into classic individual sins. The tendency is not exclusively corporate. Power has been corrupting rulers for millenniums. However, emperors and kings often escaped punishment because they were considered quasi-divine and were therefore allowed to behave differently from lesser mortals.\\r\\nCorporate bosses are an uncomfortable hybrid of chief and executive. They are paid and honored like royalty, but are expected to follow the same rules and show the same restraint as every other employee. Type-A behavior often enhances the chief side of the job, but is always an imperfect fit with good conduct.\\r\\nCompanies have four lines of defense to avoid Mr. Ghosn-style debacles. Each of them needs to be kept strong.\\r\\n\u2022 The first is bureaucracy. Like all of their underlings, chief executives are expected to subject their decisions to committees and submit to audit trails and standard rules of conduct. These systems never work perfectly, but without them there would be far more tales of Type-A bosses suffering from the ethical equivalent of cardiac arrest. Still, additional bureaucratic checks \u2014 say regular personalized audits and a direct line between whistle-blowers and the board of directors \u2014 might be even more effective.\\r\\n\u2022 The board is the second firewall. Powerful bosses all too often choose directors who are Type-B weaklings and give them a free hand. Without genuine discipline from strong, cautious types, though, the boss\u2019s lack of restraint is all too likely to wander into inappropriate pursuits. A special committee to supervise the chief executive, made up of truly independent directors, could help.\\r\\n\u2022 Third comes the conscience of the boss. Successful Type-A people are usually very persuasive, and can usually persuade themselves that, say, very high salaries do not provide an adequate reward for their exceptional contributions. It is hard to stimulate helpful self-doubt, but mandatory spiritual retreats are worth a try. Or perhaps, like absolute monarchs of the past, bosses need court jesters with a license to tell the chief executive some hard truths.\\r\\n\u2022 Finally, there is punishment. Fear can helpfully concentrate otherwise unwilling minds. Imprisoning, impoverishing and shaming one or two bosses will not discourage many egomaniacs. Their confidence that they should be judged by different standards is remarkably hard to shake. However, as chief executive pay has risen, punishment has declined. Both trends make moral errors more likely.\\r\\nThe common theme in all of these defenses is disbelief. If underlings, directors, shareholders and prosecutors did not think that the big boss walked on water, professionally speaking, then bad behavior would be less tolerated. Then future cost killers and company builders would be less likely to also destroy their souls.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1042698169,\"description\":\"There are four obvious lines of defense that can be used to stop chief executives from engulfing themselves and their companies in scandal.\\r\",\"title\":\"Breakingviews: How to Stop Radical C.E.O.s From Going Rogue\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"business.25.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"It is that time of year again, the time for outdoor holiday lighting, and homeowners now have options besides climbing a ladder in the cold to hang decorations.\\r\\nProfessional lighting installers say business is brisk as the economy skates along, with homeowners willing to pay to avoid the headache of untangling strings of lights and running extension cords.\\r\\nNick Schriver, founder of Decorating Elves in Tampa, Fla., said people increasingly outsourced chores like mowing lawns and picking up dry cleaning, so hiring someone to put up Christmas lights was an extension of that trend. \u201cThe culture is becoming more service oriented.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Schriver said he began hanging Christmas lights as a side job while in college some 16 years ago and eventually founded his own outdoor lighting company. Decorating Elves, he said, now has 10 full-time employees and adds 50 during the holiday season. (The firm also provides year-round outdoor lighting services.)\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s becoming bigger,\u201d he said, adding that the company is busy enough that it has to turn down jobs during holiday crunchtime.\\r\\nWhile Christmas d\u00e9cor accounts for the bulk of his seasonal business, Mr. Schriver said, he also has some demand for Hanukkah-themed displays, like large menorahs illuminated with blue and white lights.\\r\\nOutdoor holiday lighting is so popular that the Association of Outdoor Lighting Professionals, a trade group, gives an annual award just for that category (which Mr. Schriver\u2019s company won in 2016 and 2017).\\r\\nSafety may also be a factor behind the interest in professional installations. The Consumer Product Safety Commission last year estimated that in 2016 there were 14,700 holiday decorating-related injuries treated in emergency rooms, or an average of 240 per day during November and December. The most frequent decorating incidents were falls, the commission said, including three deaths involving falls from ladders.\\r\\nMany professional companies not only hang and remove the holiday lights, but also store the decorations after the holidays.\\r\\nHow much does it cost to have a professional take over the decorations? That will vary by region, the size of your house and the dazzle of the display. Basic d\u00e9cor, like lights that outline your roof and front door, may cost $500 or less if you own a single-story home. But if you have a larger house with lots of gables or want more eye-catching d\u00e9cor, the price can stretch to thousands of dollars.\\r\\nAt Christmas Decor, a professional holiday decorator with locations across the country and in Canada, the average cost of a display in the United States is $1,650, said Brandon Stephens, the company\u2019s president. Pricing tends to be higher on the coasts, he said, and lower in the nation\u2019s interior.\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019d say there\u2019s a larger group of people more willing to spend on decorations,\u201d he said. The company said its sales last year rose by 14 percent, with a similar increase expected this year.\\r\\nWhile classic white lights remain popular, consumers have choices far beyond the traditional. Homeowners may now select tubes of glowing lights that mimic falling snowflakes, giant ornament decorations or app-controlled light strips that blink in patterns synchronized with music.\\r\\n\u201cPeople are looking for that showstopper,\u201d Mr. Stephens said. Specialty items include six-foot-tall, three-dimensional snowflakes.\\r\\nChristmas Decor\u2019s representatives take a photo of your house with a tablet, then superimpose lighting displays on the image. If the suggested display is too costly, the software can adjust the proposed lighting until the represented results fit your budget.\\r\\nWhile professional installations are costlier than doing it yourself, the advent of LED lighting, which is much more energy-efficient than traditional incandescent bulbs, means powering the holiday d\u00e9cor doesn\u2019t have to be as wallet-draining as it once was. Some people still prefer the look of incandescent lights, but professionals say the quality of LED lighting has improved significantly in recent years. The bulbs no longer \u201cflicker\u201d and are available in a range of colors.\\r\\nHere are some questions and answers about professionally installed holiday lighting:\\r\\nHow can I manage the cost of my outdoor holiday display?\\r\\nTry teaming up with other homeowners on your street for a group quote for lighting installation. \u201cIf you and your neighbors get together, you may get a lower per-house rate,\u201d said Sarabeth Asaff, chief writer with Fixr.com, a home services site. Putting the lights on a timer will help manage your electrical costs. And as with other home improvement projects, she said, seek three bids to get a true picture of what the job should cost.\\r\\nWhat if I prefer hanging lights myself?\\r\\nYou have company. The National Retail Federation expects holiday spending, including money spent on decorations, to increase by about 4 percent this year.\\r\\nChristmas Lights Etc., an online d\u00e9cor seller, offers do-it-yourself suggestions on its website, including tips for attaching lights to your gutters.\\r\\nYou can also look for advice on choosing lights on Wirecutter, a New York Times affiliate.

Andrew M. Cuomo, and well before her extended and well-documented bouts with breast cancer.\\r\\nAnd it was absolutely before her cellphone rang that day.\\r\\nIt was Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, a Democrat like Mr. Cuomo. And just like that, Ms. Lee \u2014 the reluctant and unofficial first lady of New York \u2014 started to pitch Mr. Inslee on replicating a New York law concerning cancer coverage, urging him to provide money in his state\u2019s budget for screenings and asking if she can send him bill language to examine.\\r\\nAll the while, Ms. Lee, who had just laughed off the idea of herself as a political player, is nodding and smiling at Mr. Inslee\u2019s seemingly encouraging response. She thanked the governor for his time, and then signed off.\\r\\n\u201cPlease tell the first lady,\u201d Ms. Lee said, \u201cthat the first girlfriend said hello.\u201d\\r\\n[What you need to know to start your day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]\\r\\nIt would be difficult to describe a woman who has spent much of her adult life in front of television cameras as reclusive; Ms. Lee is arguably more famous as a Food Network star than Mr. Cuomo is as a governor. But during the governor\u2019s nearly eight years in office, Ms. Lee has largely avoided the political spotlight, appearing only sporadically at events like Easter egg hunts and gay pride parades.\\r\\nShe does not campaign with Mr. Cuomo, and while she stood beaming on the dais in Midtown Manhattan on election night, as he was easily elected to a third term, she was not in photos of the campaign and governmental team taken at a private celebration later.\\r\\nIn recent months, however, Ms. Lee has begun to flex her ample charm and determination in what she calls \u201cmy campaign,\u201d a nationwide effort to fight breast cancer. Ms. Lee, 52, is a survivor of that disease, having been diagnosed in March 2015; she underwent a double mastectomy two months later.\\r\\nThat procedure is a central part of an HBO documentary, \u201cRx: Early Detection, A Cancer Journey with Sandra Lee,\u201d that her company, Sandra Lee Incorporated, produced and debuted in October.\\r\\nAs part of the campaign to promote the film and her cause, Ms. Lee offered The New York Times a rare glimpse of her life and partnership with Mr. Cuomo, as she highlighted her efforts to get other states to replicate a so-called \u201cNo Excuses\u201d bill that Mr. Cuomo signed in 2016, expanding breast cancer screening and eliminating insurance co-pays for screening mammograms.\\r\\nMs. Lee has been carefully assembling a to-do list \u2014 color-coded, naturally \u2014 and calling top officials in several Democrat-led states. And while her method of lobbying is often as casual as her \u201csemi-homemade\u201d cuisine, which famously combines prepackaged ingredients with a smattering of fresh ones, her intentions are far more deliberate.\\r\\n\u201cI think that the older that you get and the more thoughtful that you get and the more educated that you get about the well-being of the next generation to come, you have to be focused,\u201d Ms. Lee said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not spending your days making the planet a better place, what are you doing?\u201d\\r\\nIn conversation, she is unfiltered, self-effacing and frequently extemporaneous. At one point during an interview, she handed a reporter a handwritten copy of her favorite smoothie recipe. \u201cYou should have that every morning,\u201d she said.\\r\\nIn speaking about politics, she immediately mentioned her distaste for it, particularly the bare-knuckled variety practiced in New York, where Mr. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio have often skirmished.\\r\\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the nonsense of the fighting,\u201d Ms. Lee said. \u201cI think it\u2019s unnecessary. I think everybody deserves a seat at the table, and everybody gets a say.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cI hate conflict,\u201d she added, at another moment. \u201cConflict and I am not \u2026\u201d Then she stops, and suddenly pivots. \u201cI like Bill de Blasio. I like him. We have a rapport,\u201d she said.\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019ll stand there and I like him. I do,\u201d she concluded. \u201cI don\u2019t like conflict. With anybody.\u201d\\r\\nThat bonhomie could be catching: Mr. de Blasio\u2019s Office of Media and Entertainment honored Ms. Lee at the Gotham Awards on Monday for her 40-minute film, which is arresting in its portrait of her medical battle, with graphic depictions of the surgery and her recovery, including nudity and necrotizing skin.\\r\\nAnd that was the point, she said.\\r\\n\u201cI want this to be a tool for people that have to do it to understand what it means to do it,\u201d Ms. Lee said. \u201cAnd I want people who have done it to understand what they went through.\u201d\\r\\nThe film also makes clear how serious Ms. Lee\u2019s health problems were. The cancer was initially found in three spots in her right breast, and surgeons found even more cancerous tissue. She herself has said she did not realize how bloody and invasive the surgery was until she saw the raw footage.\\r\\n\u201cI went into the editing bay and it was the surgery and I just started crying,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI walked in and immediately lost it.\u201d\\r\\nThe battle with the disease was just the latest chapter in a personal biography with enough turns and tribulation for a telenovela.\\r\\nThe eldest of five children, Ms. Lee grew up in chaotic fashion in California, Washington and Wisconsin (three states, not surprisingly, where she plans to lobby elected officials about copying Mr. Cuomo\u2019s cancer bill). When Ms. Lee was 2, her mother, then 18, dropped her and her younger sister at their grandmother\u2019s house in Santa Monica.\\r\\n\u201cShe left that day promising to return shortly,\u201d Ms. Lee wrote in her 2007 memoir, \u201cMade from Scratch.\u201d \u201cWe didn\u2019t see her again for several years.\u201d\\r\\nWhen her mother returned, the family moved to Washington and became Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. Her mother was abusive, depressive and suicidal, and her stepfather beat her with a belt and molested her. She started working at 13 and left home at 15, headed for Wisconsin to live with her birth father.\\r\\nBut after her father was sent to jail for two years on a charge of second-degree sexual assault during a domestic violence incident involving an argument with his girlfriend \u2014 Ms. Lee had to testify against him \u2014 Ms. Lee\u2019s aunt and uncle offered her a place to live in California.\\r\\nShe accepted, and soon after she started her first business \u2014 a line of window dressing accouterment \u2014 out of their house. (She still stays there when she visits, usually about once a month, to care for her aunt and uncle, now in their 80s and in faltering health.)\\r\\nThat business, Kurtain Kraft, blended ordinary objects and a do-it-yourself craftiness that landed Ms. Lee and her products on QVC. It was also a gateway to her Food Network career.\\r\\nMs. Lee met Mr. Cuomo at a party in 2005, the same year that her four-year marriage to Bruce Karatz, the former chief executive of KB Home, ended in divorce.\\r\\nMargaret Cuomo, the governor\u2019s sister, called Ms. Lee \u201cmy de facto sister,\u201d and said that her influence on Mr. Cuomo is invaluable. \u201cIt\u2019s a high-stress job and not everyone will have his best interest in mind,\u201d she said. \u201cShe does. And that\u2019s a precious gift.\u201d\\r\\nMs. Lee is protective of her relationship with Mr. Cuomo, and of his three daughters from a previous marriage to Kerry Kennedy \u2014 Cara, Michaela and Mariah \u2014 to whom she has been a surrogate mother for more than a decade.\\r\\nOn a tour of the house they share in New Castle, N.Y., much of it is deemed off-the-record, if not off-limits. What she did share showed a family home festooned with all manner of personal memento and political keepsakes: a dining room lined with reproductions of letters from the Founding Fathers and an antique ballot box; a den with a wall-size, wooden replica of the Constitution; hallways and stairwells densely populated with casual photos of family and friends, including former President Barack Obama.\\r\\nThe kitchen contains a space-capsule-size cage for Ms. Lee\u2019s two cockatoos \u2014 Phoenix and Halo \u2014 adjacent to an almost all-white sitting room, with views of the patio fireplace on one side and on the other, a duck pond, surrounded by small signs noting the New York State Police patrols to warn off trespassers.\\r\\nMs. Lee\u2019s two Emmy Awards sit on a piano that belonged to her grandmother. Bathroom hand towels are adorned with gold Cs and Ls, in cursive. They are disposable.\\r\\nMs. Lee mostly sidestepped questions about Mr. Cuomo, but allowed that she was affected by what she said were unfair portrayals of his character.\\r\\n\u201cI am the one who watches him work every single hour of every single day and not sleep,\u201d Ms. Lee said, sitting outside their home surrounded by pumpkins and other autumnal decorations.\\r\\nEmotion stopped her for a moment, and then she continued.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to watch this be hard on someone you love. And know that they do everything right, every day, for everyone,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s not O.K.\u201d\\r\\nShe continued: \u201cI think if people saw the day to day, they would only say, \u2018Thank you.\u2019 That\u2019s the truth.\u201d\\r\\nMs. Lee even briefly became an issue on the campaign trail, when Mr. Cuomo\u2019s Republican opponent, Marcus J. Molinaro, suggested that her financial information should be made public. (Because they are not married, Mr. Cuomo does not have to disclose any information about Ms. Lee\u2019s business dealings.) Ms. Lee did not feel that was warranted, and said she appreciated Mr. Molinaro\u2019s wife telling him to not attack her.\\r\\nIn another aside, during the pre-election stroll in Van Nuys, she also dismissed talk that Mr. Cuomo would run for president. \u201cHe\u2019s told me he doesn\u2019t have any interest right now,\u201d she said.\\r\\nAgain and again, Ms. Lee said she understands how politics works \u2014 \u201cI know how to maneuver it. I have friends that are in it, obviously my partner is part of it,\u201d she said \u2014 but she wants to stay out of the fray.\\r\\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to get mad, get mad because someone has cancer,\u201d she said. Or because children are hungry, or \u201celderly people are being abused.\u201d\\r\\nAnd then, she said, turn that anger into action.\\r\\nIn the meantime, other projects await: a how-to show with her sister, Kimber; a series of children\u2019s books featuring a character called Aunt Sandy Claus; another series based on her 2013 novel \u201cThe Recipe Box.\u201d\\r\\nShe also said she wants to do a documentary about dying, tentatively called \u201cSilent Lucidity,\u201d a title borrowed from the heavy metal band Queensr\u00ffche, one of several hard-rock groups she likes. (Def Leppard, Rush and Led Zeppelin also make the cut.)\\r\\nMs. Lee is healthy; she announced in 2016 that she is cancer free.

Noel preferential treatment when the agency last year shrank the size of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in a way that excluded a parcel of land owned by Mr. Noel.\\r\\nInvestigators concluded there was also no evidence that Mr. Zinke or other Interior staff \u201cwere aware of Mr. Noel\u2019s financial interest in the revised boundaries, or that they gave Noel any preferential treatment in the resulting proposed boundaries,\u201d according to a November 21 letter Ms. Kendall wrote to David Bernhardt, the deputy secretary of the Interior.\\r\\nMr. Zinke is the chief architect of a number of President Trump\u2019s environmental regulatory rollbacks. Several investigations into his behavior at the agency are still pending, and he also faces a possible Department of Justice inquiry into his involvement in a land deal in Whitefish, Mont., linked to the energy giant Halliburton. \\r\\nMr. Zinke\u2019s spokeswoman, Heather Swift, did not respond to requests for comment about the national monument investigation. \\r\\nMr. Noel, reached by phone in Utah on Tuesday, said he felt vindicated. He called the investigation, requested by the Western Values Project, an environmental watchdog group, \u201cpretty spurious\u201d and said he spent more than two hours speaking with federal investigators who traveled to Utah to interview him. \\r\\nThe Associated Press earlier reported on the inspector general\u2019s findings.\\r\\nThe Western Values Project had claimed that Mr. Noel \u2014 who had toured the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument with Mr. Zinke during a review last year of the boundaries \u2014 failed to properly disclose that he owned 40 acres of land within the monument. The land was ultimately removed from the monument boundaries. Mr. Noel on Tuesday said he owns thousands of acres of land in the region, adding, \u201cThere was really nothing to report because I have never talked to the secretary about any of my property.\u201d \\r\\nRepresentative Raul Grijalva of Arizona, a Democrat who is expected to chair the House Natural Resources Committee next year, said in a statement he accepts the results of the investigation into Mr. Zinke. He also said that \u201cthe process he and President Trump used to destroy Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante will be front and center in our oversight and investigations efforts\u201d when Democrats formally take control of the House.\\r\\nChris Saeger, director of the Western Values Project, criticized the Interior Department for not releasing the full investigative report.\\r\\nRepresentative Rob Bishop of Utah, the current Republican chairman of committee, noted in a statement that the inspector general found Mr. Zinke acted in good faith. \u201cThis investigation\u2019s closure marks the end of one politically-motivated attack against Secretary Zinke\u2019s efforts to empower local communities against government overreach,\u201d he said.\\r\\nShortly after taking office, President Trump launched a review of about two dozen national monuments. From the start, though, Bears Ears National Monument (created by former President Obama in 2016) and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument (created by President Clinton in 1996) were in the administration\u2019s cross hairs, with Mr. Trump calling their creation an \u201cegregious use of federal power.\u201d\\r\\nIn December, Mr. Trump announced he would shrink Bears Ears by 85 percent and diminish Grand Staircase nearly by half, from its original 1.9 million acres to 1 million acres.\\r\\nFor more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1195195444,\"description\":\"The investigation looked at whether he had redrawn the boundaries of a national monument in Utah to avoid the nearby land holdings of a state lawmaker and supporter of President Donald Trump.\\r\",\"title\":\"Interior Department Watchdog Clears Zinke of Wrongdoing in National Monument Inquiry\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.32.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"KANDAHAR, Afghanistan \u2014 The Taliban\u2019s most senior commander in southern Afghanistan was killed in an American airstrike, the insurgent group and Afghan and American officials said on Sunday.\\r\\nThe commander, Mullah Abdul Manan, had orchestrated the insurgents\u2019 campaign to take over much of Helmand Province.

His GPS collar last sent a signal at 1 p.m. on Nov. 9, but failed to register at the next automatic check-in, at 5 p.m. that same day.\\r\\n\u201cWe never got another point after that,\u201d Seth Riley, the wildlife branch chief at the recreation area, said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cThe fire came through that evening in his area.\u201d\\r\\nWith the help of firefighters, Mr. Riley and other park officials searched the seared terrain, including the exact area of P-74\u2019s last known location, for any signs that he survived. But they came up with nothing, leading Mr. Riley to conclude that P-74 was trapped in the fire and his collar destroyed.\\r\\nNo other animals that are tracked by rangers, including coyotes and four bobcats, were believed to have died, he said.\\r\\nThe Woolsey Fire engulfed a swath of subdivisions and wildlife in the hills above Malibu, charring nearly 97,000 acres by the time firefighters were able to contain it on Nov. 21. A separate wildfire in Northern California, the Camp Fire, roared during the same period and has killed at least 88 people, though it was contained on Nov. 25. While many people lost homes, the Woolsey Fire also devastated the delicate urban habitat home to an estimated 10 to 15 mountain lions in the Santa Monica Mountains.\\r\\nThe Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area stretches about 154,000 acres in northwest Los Angeles County and is largely defined by Highway 101 to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the south. The imposing boundaries trap wildlife in the area and make it nearly impossible for newcomers to enter.\\r\\nAbout half of the park\u2019s natural area burned, destroying vegetation and small animals that could not outrun the fast-moving fire and smoke, Mr. Riley said. The region\u2019s population of wood rats was hit particularly hard, because they naturally retreat to their nests made of sticks when threatened.\\r\\n[Sign up for the Morning Briefing newsletter for a look at what you need to know to begin your day.]\\r\\nThe animals that did survive had to flee to the fertile and habitable areas that remain. Park rangers are closely monitoring how they adapt and survive in what is one of the largest urban wildlife areas in the world.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting and massive experiment,\u201d Mr. Riley said. \u201cYou eliminate the natural habitat from half of it, and then what is going to happen?\u201d\\r\\nWhile the site became a national recreation area in 1978, the park did not begin to track the mammals there until the 1990s, starting with bobcats and coyotes. In 2002, rangers started to trap mountain lions, affix GPS devices to them and map their movements.\\r\\nThe latest addition to the group was P-74, who wandered into a cage in mid-September that park rangers had set up with the remains of a recently killed deer. With his GPS collar attached, P-74 was spotted about a month later with a female mountain lion believed to be his mother.\\r\\nPark rangers do not know whether that female, which did not have a GPS collar, also died, Mr. Riley said.\\r\\nWhile all the other mountain lions with collars survived, rangers are still concerned about the health of one male named P-64, perhaps the most adventurous member of the group. Mr. Riley said that P-64 had found a safe way to travel between parts of the park separated by the busy Highway 101: through a narrow, dark tunnel under the highway.\\r\\nSince the Woolsey Fire, the GPS collar on P-64 has indicated that he is moving around but only in a several hundred yard area in the Simi Hills. For cats that travel more than a mile in a day, the lack of movement is concerning, Mr. Riley said.\\r\\nA park biologist was expected to visit the area of P-64\u2019s last location soon. The mountain lion, which was captured and tagged in February, could have been injured.\\r\\n\u201cClearly he survived the fire, but we are not sure what he is doing since then,\u201d Mr. Riley said. \u201cWe have some concerns.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1299341996,\"description\":\"P-74, the newest mountain lion electronically tracked by park rangers in the Santa Monica Mountains, was last seen in one of the first areas to be scorched in the blaze.\\r\",\"title\":\"Mountain Lion Tracked in Southern California Likely Died in Woolsey Fire, Park Says\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.34.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"In Mexico, journalists have been killed by arson, gunned down at a cafe and shot execution-style while out at a bar.

But a report released this past week by Reporters Without Borders documented more than two dozen who had been killed by members of organized crime since the start of 2017, including fatal attacks in Mexico and Europe that underscored the entrenched power of criminal syndicates around the world.\\r\\nThis year, at least a dozen journalists have been killed by members of organized crime, according to the report, bringing the kind of violence often associated with war zones to countries like Malta or Brazil that are farther from the chaos of the front lines. In many cases, the crimes go unpunished by authorities who are hostile to the news media or are involved in criminal activity themselves.\\r\\n\u201cAs opposed to Syria or Afghanistan, where the press is often killed by terrorist groups, this report shows the link when government and corrupt organizations work in tandem to silence the work of journalists in a really covert way,\u201d said Noni Ghani, a spokeswoman for Reporters Without Borders. \u201cThese things don\u2019t just happen in conflict zones or countries at war. They really happen everywhere.\u201d\\r\\nMexico has borne the brunt of these killings. Nine reporters were killed by organized crime in Mexico in 2017, and at least four have been killed there since the start of this year, according to Reporters Without Borders. The group said it was investigating four more killings to determine whether they were linked to organized crime.\\r\\n\u201cWe have reported 32 Mexican journalists that have been killed by drug cartels since 2012, and 90 percent of the crimes against journalists in Mexico have gone unpunished,\u201d Ms. Ghani said. \u201cIt\u2019s a country where impunity prevails more than any other country.\u201d\\r\\nSix were killed elsewhere in Latin America, the group said. In Ecuador, two journalists, Javier Ortega and Pa\u00fal Rivas, and their driver, Efra\u00edn Segarra, were kidnapped in March and later killed by Colombian drug traffickers. And in Brazil, Jefferson Pureza Lopes, Jairo Sousa and Marlon de Carvalho Ara\u00fajo, three journalists who had been critical of local officials, were gunned down by gang members in separate attacks.\\r\\nIn India, Sandeep Sharma, who exposed an illegal sand-mining ring that included a local police chief, was run down and killed by a truck.\\r\\nThe European Union, which has historically enjoyed high levels of press freedom, has not been spared. Two journalists, Jan Kuciak in Slovakia and Daphne Caruana Galizia in Malta, have been killed there in the last two years, reflecting the spread of Italian mafia activity throughout the bloc. The killing of a third journalist, Viktoria Marinova, in Bulgaria in October is being investigated to determine whether criminal organizations were involved.\\r\\nReporters Without Borders said it had also documented at least five murder attempts against journalists that were planned or executed by members of criminal organizations, along with numerous threats or nonlethal attacks on journalists that were linked to organized crime.\\r\\nWhile journalists in the United States have safer working conditions, they have also increasingly faced pressure, with a steady drumbeat of verbal attacks from President Trump and his allies. The tension escalated sharply in October when explosive devices were mailed to the New York offices of CNN, a frequent target of Mr. Trump\u2019s ire, as well as to Democrats critical of the president. No one was injured by the devices.\\r\\nOver all, the number of journalists who have died or been killed while working has climbed over the past year, said Robert Mahoney, the deputy executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists. That includes deaths in which the journalist was not targeted and in killings unrelated to organized crime.\\r\\nHe pointed to the death of Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist who wrote for The Washington Post and was killed in October by a Saudi government hit squad inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Mr. Mahoney also cited lower-profile killings in conflict zones like Syria, where nine journalists have died this year, or in Afghanistan, where at least 12 have lost their lives.\\r\\nIn slightly less than 90 percent of cases, the perpetrators of attacks against journalists go unpunished, Mr. Mahoney said.\\r\\n\u201cThere is very little justice for slain journalists,\u201d he said. \u201cThat sends a terrible signal to journalists around the world that the state, the judiciary, law enforcement is not going to protect you.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1023156350,\"description\":\"More than two dozen journalists worldwide have been killed by members of organized crime since the start of 2017, according to a report by Reporters Without Borders.\\r\",\"title\":\"Killings of Journalists Show the Bloody Fingerprints of Organized Crime\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"world.24.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Send questions about the office, money, careers and work-life balance to workfriend@nytimes.com.

Recently I asked the main organizer (one of two drivers) for a breakdown of the charges he levies on each member. I was stunned to find out that he was effectively doubling the cost of each trip by charging for every conceivable cost of maintaining his car \u2014 including depreciation, tires, routine maintenance \u2014 and soon, the cost of a new car. It\u2019s his car; he would be driving to work each day regardless of whether there were other passengers or not. I feel that charging anything above gas and a driver charge is unfair.\\r\\n\u2014 Halifax, Nova Scotia\\r\\nFrom my studies of heterosexual culture, isn\u2019t the idea of a \u201ccar pool\u201d that turns are taken, and cost is therefore assumed equally by means of the turn in which one is the provider of the \u201ccar\u201d to the \u201cpool\u201d? Is it not something like a key party, but the keys are for the starting of cars? Like gender-reveal parties and premade pie crusts in grocery stores, this is totally baffling to me. Run, quit, emigrate, anything, just get away!\\r\\n\\r\\nA More Serious Question\\r\\nI cannot stand my colleagues. For two years, one has asked me uncomfortable, emotionally manipulative questions that I know purposefully push my boundaries: personal financial questions, extremely personal relationship questions about my boyfriend, asking repeatedly exactly where I live and the route I take to get home. Once, he said he \u201cneeded help watering his plant,\u201d and then came up behind me and pushed me into his desk, which I certainly consider sexual harassment. I would report this, but I know it would destroy my small team and not end well \u2014 not to mention that my other colleagues have made their views on #MeToo clear. \\r\\nI feel stuck. I know only very bad bad uncomfortable things would come of reporting the guy, because the rest of the team would not support me, and it could jeopardize my ability to get a reference from my boss in the future. But I hate working with this guy, and I believe that women should report this stuff. I am planning to move cities in the next year and I don\u2019t want to find another job to fill only a short gap. I am going crazy over here from anger and loneliness.\\r\\n\u2014 Anonymous\\r\\nBecause this has been going on for a while, you have played an endless tape in your head of what would happen if you spoke up. A wind blows in a dark clearing, a half-moon of men all turn white faces to you in unison, revealing \u2026 gleaming vampire fangs? \u201cVery bad bad uncomfortable things\u201d is an incredible phrase. But these very bad bad things are, for now, a fantasy.\\r\\nLet\u2019s think about the consequences if you spoke up. Maybe you\u2019ll be fired, or isolated. Maybe you\u2019ll have to go to horrible HR meetings. Maybe they\u2019ll key your car. Maybe they\u2019ll stalk you. \\r\\nFor asking that your workplace be not foul, you could be the one to suffer financially or personally. It really could be worse than what you\u2019re experiencing now. The real world is shabby and the right thing doesn\u2019t always happen. \\r\\nBut these Chads and Ricks are just dudes. They\u2019re not supernatural. \\r\\nAnd what you\u2019re going through now is awful. This is a stupid example but: One day at my desk while enjoying a nice deli BLT, a wisdom tooth started making shooting pains. The tooth did not magically improve. But to me, nothing was scarier than the idea of confronting the situation. For many years I let this tooth slowly, agonizingly disintegrate in my mouth. I\u2019d be snacking on a muffin and then suddenly I\u2019d be crunching down on a sliver of tooth. I felt more comfortable with the agony I knew and didn\u2019t want to risk something worse. What I\u2019m saying is: I\u2019m the dumbest person alive and also a coward. Fortunately, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re like me.\\r\\nI\u2019m not suggesting you do something because it\u2019s the right thing to do, or because it\u2019ll be easier than what you\u2019re going through, or because you\u2019ll feel better. I think you should do something because you\u2019re not living by your own ideals. I think you\u2019re disappointed in yourself. You don\u2019t want to make a mess. You don\u2019t want to \u201cdestroy\u201d your small team (which should clearly be destroyed). You\u2019re hiding, because you\u2019re afraid. Well, you should be! I think you wrote in for courage, though. The least you can do for yourself is get unstuck. Grab the wheel with both hands and feel alive again. \\r\\nLLC for You and Me\\r\\nI jumped into a partnership without any thought. I went into business with friends. \\r\\nWorse, they came from the most toxic workplace on earth. They swore the toxic workplace was behind them and that, together, we would create a new work environment filled with friendship and sisterhood and respecting of boundaries. And then they turned out to not be my friends at all and to, in fact, still be carrying toxicity, pulsing through their veins and gushing in and out of their wizened aortas. I thought I was being gaslighted, but that seemed too dramatic. (And could women even do that to each other, or was it strictly a male-on-female crime?) Then I looked it up, and I was being gaslighted, and then some.\\r\\nI came close to a nervous breakdown, and hid out for long enough that their baby company began to crumble without me. Then I ran for the hills. My question is: Are all partnerships impossible?\\r\\n\u2014 Anonymous\\r\\nI spent, all told, about 15 years as a business partner in start-ups, though probably never a particularly good one. They say the secret is communication. But communication is the worst! Communication usually involves feelings and telephones, two of the most gross things. The best I could ever do in a business marriage is how I try to do regular love-marriage. If you can truly explain and manage the most important values to your partner that are also alien to you \u2014 whether they\u2019re about privacy, or dignity, or fairness, or money \u2014 then you\u2019re doing the best job possible, even if you\u2019re doing a shabby job otherwise. Partners have to stand together in the face of adversity. If you can\u2019t explain what your partner cares about and why, it\u2019s time to get divorced in the great state of Delaware. In time you will learn to love LLC-style again.\\r\\nChoire Sicha is the Styles editor of The Times.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-426621661,\"description\":\"You can suffer forever with men behaving badly at work.

The WSJ reports that the U.S. and China \u201care exploring a trade deal in which Washington would hold off on further tariffs through the spring in exchange for new talks looking at big changes in Chinese economic policy,\u201d according to unidentified sources.\\r\\nBut Mr. Trump remains unpredictable. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we want to do it,\u201d he told reporters yesterday. \u201cI\u2019m open to making a deal, but frankly, I like the deal we have now.\u201d The president said this week that he would probably still increase tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods on Jan. 1.\\r\\nAnd a long-term truce may be a pipe dream. \u201cAny agreement in Argentina will be a tactical pause at best,\u201d Ely Ratner argues in Foreign Affairs. \u201cOn most issues of consequence, there is simply no overlap between Xi\u2019s vision for China\u2019s rise and what the United States considers an acceptable future for Asia and the world beyond.\u201d\\r\\n____________________________\\r\\nToday\u2019s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York, and Michael J. de la Merced and Jamie Condliffe in London.\\r\\n____________________________\\r\\nTrump\u2019s business ties with Russia run deeper than we thought\\r\\nMichael Cohen pleaded guilty yesterday to lying to Congress. It\u2019s the first charge that President Trump\u2019s former top lawyer faced from Robert Mueller, the special counsel. But Mr. Cohen\u2019s admission that Mr. Trump was more involved in trying to build a tower in Moscow than had originally been stated was the real news.\\r\\nWhat happened: Mr. Cohen said that he and an associate spoke with Russian contacts for months in 2016 about the Trump group\u2019s plans for a huge new building in Moscow. The proposal included giving President Vladimir Putin of Russia a $50 million penthouse in the tower, BuzzFeed News reports, citing unnamed sources.\\r\\nWhy it might be a big deal: The NYT reports that Mr. Cohen\u2019s admission \u201craises the possibility that he might have information about the central focus of the inquiry: whether President Trump or any of his associates conspired with Russia\u2019s efforts to disrupt the 2016 election.\u201d The NYT also asks: Did the effort influence Mr. Trump\u2019s views on U.S. sanctions on Russia?\\r\\nThe White House response: Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers played down the news, saying that the president\u2019s written statements about his Moscow dealings matched Mr. Cohen\u2019s account. The president said yesterday that he would have gone back to business had he lost in 2016, so \u201cwhy should I lose lots of opportunities?\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFacebook\u2019s vetting of George Soros finances\\r\\nIt seems that Sheryl Sandberg wasn\u2019t thrilled when the liberal billionaire delivered a speech at the World Economic Forum in January calling Facebook and Google a \u201cmenace\u201d to society and expressing support for more regulation of the companies.\\r\\nMs. Sandberg is said to have questioned his motivations. She \u201casked Facebook\u2019s communications staff to research George Soros\u2019s financial interests in the wake of his high-profile attacks on tech companies, according to three people with knowledge of her request,\u201d write Nicholas Confessore and Matthew Rosenberg of the NYT. Specifically, she wanted to know whether he was betting against the company\u2019s stock.\\r\\nFacebook says the vetting started earlier. \u201cMr. Soros is a prominent investor, and we looked into his investments and trading activity related to Facebook,\u201d the company said. \u201cThat research was already underway when Sheryl sent an email asking if Mr. Soros had shorted Facebook\u2019s stock.\u201d\\r\\nThis compounds Facebook\u2019s recent P.R. scandal. \u201cThe revelation complicates Ms. Sandberg\u2019s shifting explanations of her role in Facebook\u2019s decisions to hire Definers and go on the offensive against the social network\u2019s growing legion of critics,\u201d including Mr. Soros, Mr. Confessore and Mr. Rosenberg add.\\r\\nMore Facebook news: The company will reportedly release findings of an audit of civil rights on its platform this year. And a San Francisco official proposed taking Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s name off a hospital to which the Facebook chief donated millions.\\r\\nComing up: All eyes on the G-20\\r\\nAside from the Trump-Xi dinner, there\u2019s plenty to note from the Group of 20 meeting that kicks off today in Buenos Aires:\\r\\n\u2022 President Trump canceled a meeting with President Vladimir Putin, citing Russia\u2019s naval clash with Ukraine.\\r\\n\u2022 Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan is expected to promote the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement.\\r\\n\u2022 Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain will try to gain international backing for her proposal to leave the E.U.\\r\\n\u2022 Mrs. May and President Emmanuel Macron of France plan to press Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, over the killing of a prominent Saudi dissident.\\r\\n\u2022 On the sidelines, the U.S., Canada and Mexico are scheduled to sign the successor to Nafta tomorrow \u2014 though details of the agreement are apparently still being worked out.\\r\\nHow Google reportedly tried to shield its China work\\r\\nThe company\u2019s efforts to restart business in China have drawn criticism from employees and outsiders. But The Intercept writes that internally, some executives tried to push the work forward while shutting out its own privacy and security specialists.\\r\\nSome staff members didn\u2019t like what they heard. Citing unidentified sources who worked on the China project, the Intercept claims that some Google workers were \u201cleft stunned\u201d by a February 2017 meeting that detailed the China work. They worried about how the Chinese government could use a new search product against its citizens.\\r\\nSenior executives reportedly dismissed those concerns. Scott Beaumont, Google\u2019s head of operations in China, is said to have \u201cshut out members of the company\u2019s security and privacy team from key meetings about the search engine, the four people said, and tried to sideline a privacy review of the plan that sought to address potential human rights abuses.\u201d\\r\\nAnd they were super-nervous about leaks. \u201cGoogle\u2019s leadership considered Dragonfly so sensitive that they would often communicate only verbally about it and would not take written notes during high-level meetings to reduce the paper trail, two sources said.\u201d\\r\\nThe bottom line: Google knows how controversial its China project is, but that doesn\u2019t appear to be stopping its executives from pushing the plans forward.\\r\\nThe Fed will raise rates in December. After that, things are less clear.\\r\\nThe U.S. central bank is poised to raise interest rates next month, according to minutes from its November meeting. While more rate increases are likely next year, they may not be as regular as this year\u2019s, Nick Timiraos of the WSJ points out:\\r\\nAt their recent meeting, officials debated whether they should change that key phrase to stress their next few moves would depend more on the most recent data, a subtle but important shifting of the Fed\u2019s policy-planning gears.\\r\\nNot everyone thinks a pause is imminent: Paul Ashworth, the chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, told the NYT that the Fed minutes \u201cdo not suggest that Fed officials anticipated an imminent pause in the tightening cycle.\u201d But indicators suggest that there may be bigger pauses along the way.\\r\\nMore Fed news: Jay Powell, the central bank\u2019s chairman, has four rules for dealing with a president who criticizes him in public: Find allies in the White House, don\u2019t fight back publicly, never discuss politics \u2014 and don\u2019t name-check President Trump.\\r\\n\\r\\nBayer is hurting from lousy deal-making\\r\\nThe German conglomerate said yesterday that it planned to sell businesses like Coppertone, Dr. Scholl\u2019s and its animal health unit. It will also lay off 12,000 employees, or about 10 percent of its work force. It\u2019s a sign that some of its biggest-ever deals have become burdensome, and two in particular appear to be too unwieldy for shareholders\u2019 liking:\\r\\nThe Merck deal. Bayer bought Merck\u2019s consumer businesses, including Coppertone and Dr. Scholl\u2019s, for $14.2 billion in 2014. But in yesterday\u2019s announcement, Bayer said selling them would help it \u201cfocus on driving profitable growth in its core consumer health categories.\u201d\\r\\nThe Monsanto acquisition. Since closing the $63 billion takeover this year, Bayer has had to contend with a huge debt load and expensive legal headaches tied to the Monsanto weed killer Roundup. While Bayer\u2019s C.E.O., Werner Baumann, told reporters yesterday that Roundup litigation wasn\u2019t a driver of the restructuring, investors still worry about the costs of the Monsanto deal.\\r\\n\\r\\nChina must act to lift its slowing manufacturing sector\\r\\nBeijing reported today that a crucial measure of its industrial activity had broken a two-year growth streak. Expect the country to take additional steps to shore up its economy.\\r\\nChina\u2019s official manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index fell in November, and is now hovering between expansion and contraction. It\u2019s the latest sign that the trade fight with the U.S. and efforts to curb risky lending at home are weighing on Chinese economic growth.\\r\\nAnalysts say they think Beijing will act.

Although stocks surged on Wednesday, a rocky autumn wiped out most of the year\u2019s gains, and investors are having difficulty mustering arguments for a market that has been unable to sustain upward momentum.\\r\\nPaul Hickey, a founder of Bespoke Investment Group, an independent market research firm, regularly tallies what he calls \u201cthe pros and cons\u201d of the stock market. I asked him for an informal update: He came up with 14 pros versus 22 cons.\\r\\nThat abundance of negativity isn\u2019t intended as a quantitative assessment of the market\u2019s prospects, but it does give a rough sense of his view and, I think, of the perspective of many skittish investors.\\r\\n\u201cWe were bullish for a long time, but right now I\u2019d say I\u2019m in a wait-and-see mode,\u201d Mr. Hickey said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a time to be cautious.\u201d\\r\\nI also asked James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist of the Leuthold Group, an investment research firm in Minneapolis, for his sense of the market. An economist, Mr. Paulsen is worried about stocks because he is worried about the economy, he said. While the United States is not in a recession now, he said, \u201cwe have moved into the ballpark of a recession.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Paulsen said neither he nor anyone else could reliably forecast a recession. \u201cThat kind of prediction is just too hard to do,\u201d he said. But, he added, it is possible to judge when the risks of recession have risen.\\r\\n\u201cIt gets somewhat easy, with a little experience, to recognize when you\u2019re in the ballpark of a recession,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. \u201cThat is where we are now, and that alone is quite a bit of information.\u201d\\r\\nGiven his current outlook, which is that the probability of a recession within two years is reasonably high though not certain, \u201cthis is a good moment to take a little risk out of your portfolio, just in case things turn down,\u201d he said.\\r\\nThe stock market, Mr. Paulsen said, often moves in advance of a recession \u2014 and a declining market can help cause a recession \u2014 making investment timing extremely difficult now. In this dangerous environment, he said, \u201cright now, I\u2019d be a little careful.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Hickey, too, advises caution, because when he enumerates the pros and cons for the market, the positive side is scanty. It includes factors like these:\\r\\n\u25a0 Despite some difficulties, the gross domestic product in the United States rose at a 3.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter.\\r\\n\u25a0 The Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Indicators index has been rising, which suggests that a recession is probably not imminent.\\r\\n\u25a0 The yield curve \u2014 the difference between long- and short-term interest rates \u2014 remains in a bullish zone, although that positive margin has been narrowing and bears close watching.\\r\\n\u25a0 The end of the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate tightening cycle may be in sight. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman, said on Wednesday that interest rates were already close to a \u201cneutral\u201d level, which might imply that rates won\u2019t rise much higher.\\r\\n\u25a0 Finally, there is already so much bad news about the stock market that it amounts to good news. According to contrarian logic, Mr. Hickey said, the negatives are baked into stock prices, so the market has room to rise.\\r\\nThat last item may be a stretch. It is an indication, he said, that he is having difficulty being upbeat.\\r\\nThe stock market negatives on Mr. Hickey\u2019s list, by contrast, are straightforward. A sampling includes these items:\\r\\n\u25a0 The trend of stock prices has been quite negative. While a string of strong days could turn that around, momentum is bearish.\\r\\n\u25a0 Despite Mr. Powell\u2019s latest comments, the Fed is still tightening monetary policy, which could easily derail the stock market and the economy.\\r\\n\u25a0 The fiscal stimulus provided by the tax cut is, increasingly, behind us. Combined with tighter monetary policy, the loss of fiscal stimulus could hurt the American economy.\\r\\n\u25a0 Tariffs have been rising, and business sentiment has been depressed by the prospect of widening trade wars.\\r\\n\u25a0 Global economic growth has been slowing, and many stock markets around the world are already in bear market territory.\\r\\n\u25a0 The domestic housing market has weakened, homebuilder stocks have plunged, commodity prices have fallen, and auto sales are relatively weak.\\r\\n\u25a0 The tech sector, which propelled the market higher earlier in the year, has now lost hundreds of billions of dollars in value. Because of the importance of stocks like Amazon, Facebook, Netflix, Alphabet (Google) and Apple, the psychological \u201cimpact of their weakness can\u2019t be overstated,\u201d Mr. Hickey said.\\r\\n\u25a0 Corporate debt levels are high, creating new vulnerabilities.\\r\\n\u25a0 The rate of earnings growth is likely to decline. That could disappoint Wall Street analysts and shake up the market.\\r\\nAnd that\u2019s just a start. The negatives go on and on.\\r\\nIn the 10th year of both an economic expansion and a great bull market, of course, it\u2019s not surprising that warning signals have begun to flash. At this stage, as I wrote recently, it seems wise to be prepared for downturns.\\r\\nYet even despite these portents, a gloomy financial outlook may not be entirely appropriate. For example, neither Mr. Hickey nor Mr. Paulsen is confident that the bull market is over or that a recession is likely to arrive soon.\\r\\n\u201cThere could be another strong bull run,\u201d Mr. Hickey said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have a good sense of that until at least the end of the year.\u201d\\r\\nI asked Mr. Paulsen to make the strongest case he reasonably could for upbeat economic and market outcomes for the next two years. In response, he said it was possible that the Fed would soften its monetary policy enough to extend the economic recovery and bolster the stock market. If the economy keeps growing and corporate earnings keep rising, Mr. Paulsen said, stocks will rise, too.\\r\\nThe odd conditions of 2018 have already made stock valuations more attractive. Because prices have been flat while earnings have risen, the price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 has declined to about 18, from about 23.5 in January, he pointed out.\\r\\nIf that trend continues, Mr. Paulsen said, stocks might become rather enticing. \u201cIf we don\u2019t go into a recession and if interest rates don\u2019t rise too much, at some point stocks could look good enough to set off another bull run,\u201d he said.\\r\\nBut he added that he wouldn\u2019t bet on it with money needed to pay the bills in the next couple of years.\\r\\nAfter a nearly 10-year bull run, the downside of the market is becoming increasingly obvious.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":116161612,\"description\":\"When the pros and cons for stocks and the economy over the next year or two are weighed, the risks appear to be dominant, our columnist says.\\r\",\"title\":\"Strategies: The Stock Market\u2019s Dangers Are Easier to See Now\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"business.32.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"JUBA, South Sudan \u2014 At least 125 women and girls seeking food aid were raped, whipped and clubbed over 10 days this month in attacks described as \u201cabhorrent\u201d even amid the widespread sexual violence of South Sudan\u2019s civil war, according to Doctors Without Borders.\\r\\nThe medical charity said on Saturday that the \u201cdramatic increase\u201d in sexual violence occurred between Nov. 19 and Thursday, as the women and girls were walking to a food distribution site in Bentiu in Unity State.

Specifically, something was missing.\\r\\nIt was summer. He was out in the country, moving fast. But strangely, he wasn\u2019t eating any bugs.\\r\\nFor a moment, Riis was transported to his childhood on the Danish island of Lolland, in the Baltic Sea. Back then, summer bike rides meant closing his mouth to cruise through thick clouds of insects, but inevitably he swallowed some anyway. When his parents took him driving, he remembered, the car\u2019s windshield was frequently so smeared with insect carcasses that you almost couldn\u2019t see through it. But all that seemed distant now. He couldn\u2019t recall the last time he needed to wash bugs from his windshield; he even wondered, vaguely, whether car manufacturers had invented some fancy new coating to keep off insects. But this absence, he now realized with some alarm, seemed to be all around him. Where had all those insects gone? And when? And why hadn\u2019t he noticed?\\r\\nRiis watched his son, flying through the beautiful day, not eating bugs, and was struck by the melancholy thought that his son\u2019s childhood would lack this particular bug-eating experience of his own. It was, he granted, an odd thing to feel nostalgic about. But he couldn\u2019t shake a feeling of loss. \u201cI guess it\u2019s pretty human to think that everything was better when you were a kid,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe I didn\u2019t like it when I was on my bike and I ate all the bugs, but looking back on it, I think it\u2019s something everybody should experience.\u201d\\r\\nI met Riis, a lanky high school science and math teacher, on a hot day in June. He was anxious about not having yet written his address for the school\u2019s graduation ceremony that evening, but first, he had a job to do. From his garage, he retrieved a large insect net, drove to a nearby intersection and stopped to strap the net to the car\u2019s roof. Made of white mesh, the net ran the length of his car and was held up by a tent pole at the front, tapering to a small, removable bag in back. Drivers whizzing past twisted their heads to stare. Riis eyed his parking spot nervously as he adjusted the straps of the contraption. \u201cThis is not 100 percent legal,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I guess, for the sake of science.\u201d\\r\\nRiis had not been able to stop thinking about the missing bugs. The more he learned, the more his nostalgia gave way to worry. Insects are the vital pollinators and recyclers of ecosystems and the base of food webs everywhere. Riis was not alone in noticing their decline. In the United States, scientists recently found the population of monarch butterflies fell by 90 percent in the last 20 years, a loss of 900 million individuals; the rusty-patched bumblebee, which once lived in 28 states, dropped by 87 percent over the same period. With other, less-studied insect species, one butterfly researcher told me, \u201call we can do is wave our arms and say, \u2018It\u2019s not here anymore!\u2019\u2009\u201d Still, the most disquieting thing wasn\u2019t the disappearance of certain species of insects; it was the deeper worry, shared by Riis and many others, that a whole insect world might be quietly going missing, a loss of abundance that could alter the planet in unknowable ways. \u201cWe notice the losses,\u201d says David Wagner, an entomologist at the University of Connecticut. \u201cIt\u2019s the diminishment that we don\u2019t see.\u201d\\r\\nBecause insects are legion, inconspicuous and hard to meaningfully track, the fear that there might be far fewer than before was more felt than documented. People noticed it by canals or in backyards or under streetlights at night \u2014 familiar places that had become unfamiliarly empty. The feeling was so common that entomologists developed a shorthand for it, named for the way many people first began to notice that they weren\u2019t seeing as many bugs. They called it the windshield phenomenon.\\r\\nTo test what had been primarily a loose suspicion of wrongness, Riis and 200 other Danes were spending the month of June roaming their country\u2019s back roads in their outfitted cars. They were part of a study conducted by the Natural History Museum of Denmark, a joint effort of the University of Copenhagen, Aarhus University and North Carolina State University. The nets would stand in for windshields as Riis and the other volunteers drove through various habitats \u2014 urban areas, forests, agricultural tracts, uncultivated open land and wetlands \u2014 hoping to quantify the disorienting sense that, as one of the study\u2019s designers put it, \u201csomething from the past is missing from the present.\u201d\\r\\nWhen the investigators began planning the study in 2016, they weren\u2019t sure if anyone would sign up. But by the time the nets were ready, a paper by an obscure German entomological society had brought the problem of insect decline into sharp focus. The German study found that, measured simply by weight, the overall abundance of flying insects in German nature reserves had decreased by 75 percent over just 27 years. If you looked at midsummer population peaks, the drop was 82 percent.\\r\\nRiis learned about the study from a group of his students in one of their class projects. They must have made some kind of mistake in their citation, he thought. But they hadn\u2019t. The study would quickly become, according to the website Altmetric, the sixth-most-discussed scientific paper of 2017. Headlines around the world warned of an \u201cinsect Armageddon.\u201d\\r\\nWithin days of announcing the insect-collection project, the Natural History Museum of Denmark was turning away eager volunteers by the dozens. It seemed there were people like Riis everywhere, people who had noticed a change but didn\u2019t know what to make of it. How could something as fundamental as the bugs in the sky just disappear? And what would become of the world without them?\\r\\nAnyone who has returned to a childhood haunt to find that everything somehow got smaller knows that humans are not great at remembering the past accurately. This is especially true when it comes to changes to the natural world. It is impossible to maintain a fixed perspective, as Heraclitus observed 2,500 years ago: It is not the same river, but we are also not the same people.\\r\\nA 1995 study, by Peter H. Kahn and Batya Friedman, of the way some children in Houston experienced pollution summed up our blindness this way: \u201cWith each generation, the amount of environmental degradation increases, but each generation takes that amount as the norm.\u201d In decades of photos of fishermen holding up their catch in the Florida Keys, the marine biologist Loren McClenachan found a perfect illustration of this phenomenon, which is often called \u201cshifting baseline syndrome.\u201d The fish got smaller and smaller, to the point where the prize catches were dwarfed by fish that in years past were piled up and ignored. But the smiles on the fishermen\u2019s faces stayed the same size. The world never feels fallen, because we grow accustomed to the fall.\\r\\nBy one measure, bugs are the wildlife we know best, the nondomesticated animals whose lives intersect most intimately with our own: spiders in the shower, ants at the picnic, ticks buried in the skin. We sometimes feel that we know them rather too well. In another sense, though, they are one of our planet\u2019s greatest mysteries, a reminder of how little we know about what\u2019s happening in the world around us.\\r\\nWe\u2019ve named and described a million species of insects, a stupefying array of thrips and firebrats and antlions and caddis flies and froghoppers and other enormous families of bugs that most of us can\u2019t even name. (Technically, the word \u201cbug\u201d applies only to the order Hemiptera, also known as true bugs, species that have tubelike mouths for piercing and sucking \u2014 and there are as many as 80,000 named varieties of those.) The ones we think we do know well, we don\u2019t: There are 12,000 types of ants, nearly 20,000 varieties of bees, almost 400,000 species of beetles, so many that the geneticist J.B.S. Haldane reportedly quipped that God must have an inordinate fondness for them. A bit of healthy soil a foot square and two inches deep might easily be home to 200 unique species of mites, each, presumably, with a subtly different job to do. And yet entomologists estimate that all this amazing, absurd and understudied variety represents perhaps only 20 percent of the actual diversity of insects on our planet \u2014 that there are millions and millions of species that are entirely unknown to science.\\r\\nWith so much abundance, it very likely never occurred to most entomologists of the past that their multitudinous subjects might dwindle away. As they poured themselves into studies of the life cycles and taxonomies of the species that fascinated them, few thought to measure or record something as boring as their number. Besides, tracking quantity is slow, tedious and unglamorous work: setting and checking traps, waiting years or decades for your data to be meaningful, grappling with blunt baseline questions instead of more sophisticated ones. And who would pay for it? Most academic funding is short-term, but when what you\u2019re interested in is invisible, generational change, says Dave Goulson, an entomologist at the University of Sussex, \u201ca three-year monitoring program is no good to anybody.\u201d This is especially true of insect populations, which are naturally variable, with wide, trend-obscuring fluctuations from one year to the next.\\r\\nWhen entomologists began noticing and investigating insect declines, they lamented the absence of solid information from the past in which to ground their experiences of the present. \u201cWe see a hundred of something, and we think we\u2019re fine,\u201d Wagner says, \u201cbut what if there were 100,000 two generations ago?\u201d Rob Dunn, an ecologist at North Carolina State University who helped design the net experiment in Denmark, recently searched for studies showing the effect of pesticide spraying on the quantity of insects living in nearby forests. He was surprised to find that no such studies existed. \u201cWe ignored really basic questions,\u201d he said. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019ve dropped the ball in some giant collective way.\u201d\\r\\nIf entomologists lacked data, what they did have were some very worrying clues. Along with the impression that they were seeing fewer bugs in their own jars and nets while out doing experiments \u2014 a windshield phenomenon specific to the sorts of people who have bug jars and nets \u2014 there were documented downward slides of well-studied bugs, including various kinds of bees, moths, butterflies and beetles. In Britain, as many as 30 to 60 percent of species were found to have diminishing ranges. Larger trends were harder to pin down, though a 2014 review in Science tried to quantify these declines by synthesizing the findings of existing studies and found that a majority of monitored species were declining, on average by 45 percent.\\r\\nEntomologists also knew that climate change and the overall degradation of global habitat are bad news for biodiversity in general, and that insects are dealing with the particular challenges posed by herbicides and pesticides, along with the effects of losing meadows, forests and even weedy patches to the relentless expansion of human spaces. There were studies of other, better-understood species that suggested that the insects associated with them might be declining, too. People who studied fish found that the fish had fewer mayflies to eat. Ornithologists kept finding that birds that rely on insects for food were in trouble: eight in 10 partridges gone from French farmlands; 50 and 80 percent drops, respectively, for nightingales and turtledoves. Half of all farmland birds in Europe disappeared in just three decades. At first, many scientists assumed the familiar culprit of habitat destruction was at work, but then they began to wonder if the birds might simply be starving. In Denmark, an ornithologist named Anders Tottrup was the one who came up with the idea of turning cars into insect trackers for the windshield-effect study after he noticed that rollers, little owls, Eurasian hobbies and bee-eaters \u2014 all birds that subsist on large insects such as beetles and dragonflies \u2014 had abruptly disappeared from the landscape.\\r\\nThe signs were certainly alarming, but they were also just signs, not enough to justify grand pronouncements about the health of insects as a whole or about what might be driving a widespread, cross-species decline. \u201cThere are no quantitative data on insects, so this is just a hypothesis,\u201d Hans de Kroon, an ecologist at Radboud University in the Netherlands, explained to me \u2014 not the sort of language that sends people to the barricades.\\r\\nThen came the German study. Scientists are still cautious about what the findings might imply about other regions of the world. But the study brought forth exactly the kind of longitudinal data they had been seeking, and it wasn\u2019t specific to just one type of insect. The numbers were stark, indicating a vast impoverishment of an entire insect universe, even in protected areas where insects ought to be under less stress. The speed and scale of the drop were shocking even to entomologists who were already anxious about bees or fireflies or the cleanliness of car windshields.\\r\\nThe results were surprising in another way too. The long-term details about insect abundance, the kind that no one really thought existed, hadn\u2019t appeared in a particularly prestigious journal and didn\u2019t come from university-affiliated scientists, but from a small society of insect enthusiasts based in the modest German city Krefeld.\\r\\nKrefeld sits a half-hour drive outside D\u00fcsseldorf, near the western bank of the Rhine. It\u2019s a city of brick houses and bright flower gardens and a stadtwald \u2014 a municipal forest and park \u2014 where paddle boats float on a lake, umbrellas shade a beer garden and (I couldn\u2019t help noticing) the afternoon light through the trees illuminates small swarms of dancing insects.\\r\\nNear the center of the old city, a paper sign, not much larger than a business card, identifies the stolid headquarters of the society whose research caused so much commotion. When it was founded, in 1905, the society operated out of another building, one that was destroyed when Britain bombed the city during World War II. (By the time the bombs fell, members had moved their precious records and collections of insects, some of which dated back to the 1860s, to an underground bunker.) Nowadays, the society uses more than 6,000 square feet of an old three-story school as storage space. Ask for a tour of the collections, and you will hear such sentences as \u201cThis whole room is Lepidoptera,\u201d referring to a former classroom stuffed with what I at first took to be shelves of books but which are in fact innumerable wooden frames containing pinned butterflies and moths; and, in an even larger room, \u201cevery bumblebee here was collected before the Second World War, 1880 to 1930\u201d; and, upon opening a drawer full of sweat bees, \u201cIt\u2019s a new collection, 30 years only.\u201d\\r\\nOn the shelves that do hold books, I counted 31 clearly well-loved volumes in the series \u201cBeetles of Middle Europe.\u201d A 395-page book that cataloged specimens of spider wasps \u2014 where they were collected; where they were stored \u2014 of the western Palearctic said \u201c1948-2008\u201d on the cover. I asked my guide, a society member named Martin Sorg, who was one of the lead authors of the paper, whether those dates reflected when the specimens were collected. \u201cNo,\u201d Sorg replied, \u201cthat was the time the author needed for this work.\u201d\\r\\nSorg, who rolls his own cigarettes and wears John Lennon glasses and whose gray hair grows long past his shoulders, is not a freewheeling type when it comes to his insect work. And his insect work is really all he wants to talk about. \u201cWe think details about nature and biodiversity declines are important, not details about life histories of entomologists,\u201d Sorg explained after he and Werner Stenmans, a society member whose name appeared alongside Sorg\u2019s on the 2017 paper, dismissed my questions about their day jobs. Leery of an article that focused on him as a person, Sorg also didn\u2019t want to talk about what drew him to entomology as a child or even what it was about certain types of wasps that had made him want to devote so much of his life to studying them. \u201cWe normally give life histories when someone is dead,\u201d he said.\\r\\nThere was a reason for the wariness. Society members dislike seeing themselves described, over and over in news stories, as \u201camateurs.\u201d It\u2019s a framing that reflects, they believe, a too-narrow understanding of what it means to be an expert or even a scientist \u2014 what it means to be a student of the natural world.\\r\\nAmateurs have long provided much of the patchy knowledge we have about nature. Those bee and butterfly studies? Most depend on mass mobilizations of volunteers willing to walk transects and count insects, every two weeks or every year, year after year. The scary numbers about bird declines were gathered this way, too, though because birds can be hard to spot, volunteers often must learn to identify them by their sounds. Britain, which has a particularly strong tradition of amateur naturalism, has the best-studied bugs in the world. As technologically advanced as we are, the natural world is still a very big and complex place, and the best way to learn what\u2019s going on is for a lot of people to spend a lot of time observing it. The Latin root of the word \u201camateur\u201d is, after all, the word \u201clover.\u201d\\r\\nSome of these citizen-scientists are true beginners clutching field guides; others, driven by their own passion and following in a long tradition of \u201camateur\u201d naturalism, are far from novices. Think of Victorians with their butterfly nets and curiosity cabinets; of Vladimir Nabokov, whose theories about the evolution of Polyommatus blue butterflies were ignored until proved correct by DNA testing more than 30 years after his death; of young Charles Darwin, cutting his classes at Cambridge to collect beetles at Wicken Fen and once putting a live beetle in his mouth because his hands were already full of other bugs.\\r\\nThe Krefeld society is volunteer-run, and many members have other jobs in unrelated fields, but they also have an enormous depth of knowledge about insects, accumulated through years of what other people might consider obsessive attention. Some study the ecology or evolutionary taxonomy of their favorite species or map their populations or breed them to study their life histories. All hone their identification skills across species by amassing their own collections of carefully pinned and labeled insects like those that fill the society\u2019s storage rooms. Sorg estimated that of the society\u2019s 63 members, a third are university-trained in subjects such as biology or earth science. Another third, he said, are \u201chighly specialized and highly qualified but they never visited the university,\u201d while the remaining third are actual amateurs who are still in the process of becoming \u201creal\u201d entomologists: \u201cSome of them may also have a degree from the university, but in our view, they are beginners.\u201d\\r\\nThe society members\u2019 projects often involved setting up what are called malaise traps, nets that look like tents and drive insects flying by into bottles of ethanol. Because of the scientific standards of the society, members followed certain procedures: They always employed identical traps, sewn from a template they first used in 1982. (Sorg showed me the original rolled-up craft paper with great solemnity.) They always put them in the same places. (Before GPS, that meant a painstaking process of triangulating with surveying equipment. \u201cWe are not sure about a few centimeters,\u201d Sorg granted.) They saved everything they caught, regardless of what the main purpose of the experiment was. (The society bought so much ethanol that it attracted the attention of a narcotics unit.)\\r\\nThose bottles of insects were gathered into thousands of boxes, which are now crammed into what were once offices in the upper reaches of the school. When the society members, like entomologists elsewhere, began to notice that they were seeing fewer insects, they had something against which to measure their worries.\\r\\n\u201cWe don\u2019t throw away anything, we store everything,\u201d Sorg explained. \u201cThat gives us today the possibility to go back in time.\u201d\\r\\nIn 2013, Krefeld entomologists confirmed that the total number of insects caught in one nature reserve was nearly 80 percent lower than the same spot in 1989. They had sampled other sites, analyzed old data sets and found similar declines: Where 30 years earlier, they often needed a liter bottle for a week of trapping, now a half-liter bottle usually sufficed. But it would have taken even highly trained entomologists years of painstaking work to identify all the insects in the bottles. So the society used a standardized method for weighing insects in alcohol, which told a powerful story simply by showing how much the overall mass of insects dropped over time. \u201cA decline of this mixture,\u201d Sorg said, \u201cis a very different thing than the decline of only a few species.\u201d\\r\\nThe society collaborated with de Kroon and other scientists at Radboud University in the Netherlands, who did a trend analysis of the data that Krefeld provided, controlling for things like the effects of nearby plants, weather and forest cover on fluctuations in insect populations. The final study looked at 63 nature preserves, representing almost 17,000 sampling days, and found consistent declines in every kind of habitat they sampled. This suggested, the authors wrote, \u201cthat it is not only the vulnerable species but the flying-insect community as a whole that has been decimated over the last few decades.\u201d\\r\\nFor some scientists, the study created a moment of reckoning. \u201cScientists thought this data was too boring,\u201d Dunn says. \u201cBut these people found it beautiful, and they loved it. They were the ones paying attention to Earth for all the rest of us.\u201d\\r\\nThe current worldwide loss of biodiversity is popularly known as the sixth extinction: the sixth time in world history that a large number of species have disappeared in unusually rapid succession, caused this time not by asteroids or ice ages but by humans. When we think about losing biodiversity, we tend to think of the last northern white rhinos protected by armed guards, of polar bears on dwindling ice floes. Extinction is a visceral tragedy, universally understood: There is no coming back from it. The guilt of letting a unique species vanish is eternal.\\r\\nBut extinction is not the only tragedy through which we\u2019re living. What about the species that still exist, but as a shadow of what they once were? In \u201cThe Once and Future World,\u201d the journalist J.B. MacKinnon cites records from recent centuries that hint at what has only just been lost: \u201cIn the North Atlantic, a school of cod stalls a tall ship in midocean; off Sydney, Australia, a ship\u2019s captain sails from noon until sunset through pods of sperm whales as far as the eye can see. ... Pacific pioneers complain to the authorities that splashing salmon threaten to swamp their canoes.\u201d There were reports of lions in the south of France, walruses at the mouth of the Thames, flocks of birds that took three days to fly overhead, as many as 100 blue whales in the Southern Ocean for every one that\u2019s there now. \u201cThese are not sights from some ancient age of fire and ice,\u201d MacKinnon writes. \u201cWe are talking about things seen by human eyes, recalled in human memory.\u201d\\r\\nWhat we\u2019re losing is not just the diversity part of biodiversity, but the bio part: life in sheer quantity. While I was writing this article, scientists learned that the world\u2019s largest king penguin colony shrank by 88 percent in 35 years, that more than 97 percent of the bluefin tuna that once lived in the ocean are gone. The number of Sophie the Giraffe toys sold in France in a single year is nine times the number of all the giraffes that still live in Africa.\\r\\nFinding reassurance in the survival of a few symbolic standard-bearers ignores the value of abundance, of a natural world that thrives on richness and complexity and interaction. Tigers still exist, for example, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that 93 percent of the land where they used to live is now tigerless. This matters for more than romantic reasons: Large animals, especially top predators like tigers, connect ecosystems to one another and move energy and resources among them simply by walking and eating and defecating and dying. (In the deep ocean, sunken whale carcasses form the basis of entire ecosystems in nutrient-poor places.) One result of their loss is what\u2019s known as trophic cascade, the unraveling of an ecosystem\u2019s fabric as prey populations boom and crash and the various levels of the food web no longer keep each other in check. These places are emptier, impoverished in a thousand subtle ways.\\r\\nScientists have begun to speak of functional extinction (as opposed to the more familiar kind, numerical extinction). Functionally extinct animals and plants are still present but no longer prevalent enough to affect how an ecosystem works. Some phrase this as the extinction not of a species but of all its former interactions with its environment \u2014 an extinction of seed dispersal and predation and pollination and all the other ecological functions an animal once had, which can be devastating even if some individuals still persist. The more interactions are lost, the more disordered the ecosystem becomes. A 2013 paper in Nature, which modeled both natural and computer-generated food webs, suggested that a loss of even 30 percent of a species\u2019 abundance can be so destabilizing that other species start going fully, numerically extinct \u2014 in fact, 80 percent of the time it was a secondarily affected creature that was the first to disappear. A famous real-world example of this type of cascade concerns sea otters. When they were nearly wiped out in the northern Pacific, their prey, sea urchins, ballooned in number and decimated kelp forests, turning a rich environment into a barren one and also possibly contributing to numerical extinctions, notably of the Steller\u2019s sea cow.\\r\\nConservationists tend to focus on rare and endangered species, but it is common ones, because of their abundance, that power the living systems of our planet. Most species are not common, but within many animal groups most individuals \u2014 some 80 percent of them \u2014 belong to common species. Like the slow approach of twilight, their declines can be hard to see. White-rumped vultures were nearly gone from India before there was widespread awareness of their disappearance. Describing this phenomenon in the journal BioScience, Kevin Gaston, a professor of biodiversity and conservation at the University of Exeter, wrote: \u201cHumans seem innately better able to detect the complete loss of an environmental feature than its progressive change.\u201d\\r\\nIn addition to extinction (the complete loss of a species) and extirpation (a localized extinction), scientists now speak of defaunation: the loss of individuals, the loss of abundance, the loss of a place\u2019s absolute animalness. In a 2014 article in Science, researchers argued that the word should become as familiar, and influential, as the concept of deforestation. In 2017 another paper reported that major population and range losses extended even to species considered to be at low risk for extinction. They predicted \u201cnegative cascading consequences on ecosystem functioning and services vital to sustaining civilization\u201d and the authors offered another term for the widespread loss of the world\u2019s wild fauna: \u201cbiological annihilation.\u201d\\r\\nIt is estimated that, since 1970, Earth\u2019s various populations of wild land animals have lost, on average, 60 percent of their members. Zeroing in on the category we most relate to, mammals, scientists believe that for every six wild creatures that once ate and burrowed and raised young, only one remains. What we have instead is ourselves. A study published this year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that if you look at the world\u2019s mammals by weight, 96 percent of that biomass is humans and livestock; just 4 percent is wild animals.\\r\\nWe\u2019ve begun to talk about living in the Anthropocene, a world shaped by humans. But E.O. Wilson, the naturalist and prophet of environmental degradation, has suggested another name: the Eremocine, the age of loneliness.\\r\\nWilson began his career as a taxonomic entomologist, studying ants. Insects \u2014 about as far as you can get from charismatic megafauna \u2014 are not what we\u2019re usually imagining when we talk about biodiversity. Yet they are, in Wilson\u2019s words, \u201cthe little things that run the natural world.\u201d He means it literally. Insects are a case study in the invisible importance of the common.\\r\\nScientists have tried to calculate the benefits that insects provide simply by going about their business in large numbers. Trillions of bugs flitting from flower to flower pollinate some three-quarters of our food crops, a service worth as much as $500 billion every year. (This doesn\u2019t count the 80 percent of wild flowering plants, the foundation blocks of life everywhere, that rely on insects for pollination.) If monetary calculations like that sound strange, consider the Maoxian Valley in China, where shortages of insect pollinators have led farmers to hire human workers, at a cost of up to $19 per worker per day, to replace bees. Each person covers five to 10 trees a day, pollinating apple blossoms by hand.\\r\\nBy eating and being eaten, insects turn plants into protein and power the growth of all the uncountable species \u2014 including freshwater fish and a majority of birds \u2014 that rely on them for food, not to mention all the creatures that eat those creatures. We worry about saving the grizzly bear, says the insect ecologist Scott Hoffman Black, but where is the grizzly without the bee that pollinates the berries it eats or the flies that sustain baby salmon? Where, for that matter, are we?\\r\\nBugs are vital to the decomposition that keeps nutrients cycling, soil healthy, plants growing and ecosystems running. This role is mostly invisible, until suddenly it\u2019s not. After introducing cattle to Australia at the turn of the 19th century, settlers soon found themselves overwhelmed by the problem of their feces: For some reason, cow pies there were taking months or even years to decompose. Cows refused to eat near the stink, requiring more and more land for grazing, and so many flies bred in the piles that the country became famous for the funny hats that stockmen wore to keep them at bay. It wasn\u2019t until 1951 that a visiting entomologist realized what was wrong: The local insects, evolved to eat the more fibrous waste of marsupials, couldn\u2019t handle cow excrement. For the next 25 years, the importation, quarantine and release of dozens of species of dung beetles became a national priority. And that was just one unfilled niche. (In the United States, dung beetles save ranchers an estimated $380 million a year.) We simply don\u2019t know everything that insects do. Only about 2 percent of invertebrate species have been studied enough for us to estimate whether they are in danger of extinction, never mind what dangers that extinction might pose.\\r\\nWhen asked to imagine what would happen if insects were to disappear completely, scientists find words like chaos, collapse, Armageddon. Wagner, the University of Connecticut entomologist, describes a flowerless world with silent forests, a world of dung and old leaves and rotting carcasses accumulating in cities and roadsides, a world of \u201ccollapse or decay and erosion and loss that would spread through ecosystems\u201d \u2014 spiraling from predators to plants. E.O. Wilson has written of an insect-free world, a place where most plants and land animals become extinct; where fungi explodes, for a while, thriving on death and rot; and where \u201cthe human species survives, able to fall back on wind-pollinated grains and marine fishing\u201d despite mass starvation and resource wars. \u201cClinging to survival in a devastated world, and trapped in an ecological dark age,\u201d he adds, \u201cthe survivors would offer prayers for the return of weeds and bugs.\u201d\\r\\nBut the crux of the windshield phenomenon, the reason that the creeping suspicion of change is so creepy, is that insects wouldn\u2019t have to disappear altogether for us to find ourselves missing them for reasons far beyond nostalgia. In October, an entomologist sent me an email with the subject line, \u201cHoly [expletive]!\u201d and an attachment: a study just out from Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that he labeled, \u201cKrefeld comes to Puerto Rico.\u201d The study included data from the 1970s and from the early 2010s, when a tropical ecologist named Brad Lister returned to the rain forest where he had studied lizards \u2014 and, crucially, their prey \u2014 40 years earlier. Lister set out sticky traps and swept nets across foliage in the same places he had in the 1970s, but this time he and his co-author, Andres Garcia, caught much, much less: 10 to 60 times less arthropod biomass than before. (It\u2019s easy to read that number as 60 percent less, but it\u2019s sixtyfold less: Where once he caught 473 milligrams of bugs, Lister was now catching just eight milligrams.) \u201cIt was, you know, devastating,\u201d Lister told me. But even scarier were the ways the losses were already moving through the ecosystem, with serious declines in the numbers of lizards, birds and frogs. The paper reported \u201ca bottom-up trophic cascade and consequent collapse of the forest food web.\u201d Lister\u2019s inbox quickly filled with messages from other scientists, especially people who study soil invertebrates, telling him they were seeing similarly frightening declines. Even after his dire findings, Lister found the losses shocking: \u201cI didn\u2019t even know about the earthworm crisis!\u201d\\r\\nThe strange thing, Lister said, is that, as staggering as they are, all the declines he documented would still be basically invisible to the average person walking through the Luquillo rain forest. On his last visit, the forest still felt \u201ctimeless\u201d and \u201cphantasmagorical,\u201d with \u201ccascading waterfalls and carpets of flowers.\u201d You would have to be an expert to notice what was missing. But he expects the losses to push the forest toward a tipping point, after which \u201cthere is a sudden and dramatic loss of the rain-forest system,\u201d and the changes will become obvious to anyone. The place he loves will become unrecognizable.\\r\\nThe insects in the forest that Lister studied haven\u2019t been contending with pesticides or habitat loss, the two problems to which the Krefeld paper pointed. Instead, Lister chalks up their decline to climate change, which has already increased temperatures in Luquillo by two degrees Celsius since Lister first sampled there. Previous research suggested that tropical bugs will be unusually sensitive to temperature changes; in November, scientists who subjected laboratory beetles to a heat wave reported that the increased temperatures made them significantly less fertile. Other scientists wonder if it might be climate-induced drought or possibly invasive rats or simply \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts\u201d \u2014 a confluence of many kinds of changes to the places where insects once thrived.\\r\\nLike other species, insects are responding to what Chris Thomas, an insect ecologist at the University of York, has called \u201cthe transformation of the world\u201d: not just a changing climate but also the widespread conversion, via urbanization, agricultural intensification and so on, of natural spaces into human ones, with fewer and fewer resources \u201cleft over\u201d for nonhuman creatures to live on. What resources remain are often contaminated. Hans de Kroon characterizes the life of many modern insects as trying to survive from one dwindling oasis to the next but with \u201ca desert in between, and at worst it\u2019s a poisonous desert.\u201d Of particular concern are neonicotinoids, neurotoxins that were thought to affect only treated crops but turned out to accumulate in the landscape and to be consumed by all kinds of nontargeted bugs. People talk about the \u201closs\u201d of bees to colony collapse disorder, and that appears to be the right word: Affected hives aren\u2019t full of dead bees, but simply mysteriously empty. A leading theory is that exposure to neurotoxins leaves bees unable to find their way home. Even hives exposed to low levels of neonicotinoids have been shown to collect less pollen and produce fewer eggs and far fewer queens. Some recent studies found bees doing better in cities than in the supposed countryside.\\r\\nThe diversity of insects means that some will manage to make do in new environments, some will thrive (abundance cuts both ways: agricultural monocultures, places where only one kind of plant grows, allow some pests to reach population levels they would never achieve in nature) and some, searching for food and shelter in a world nothing like the one they were meant for, will fail. While we need much more data to better understand the reasons or mechanisms behind the ups and downs, Thomas says, \u201cthe average across all species is still a decline.\u201d\\r\\nSince the Krefeld study came out, researchers have begun searching for other forgotten repositories of information that might offer windows into the past. Some of the Radboud researchers have analyzed long-term data, belonging to Dutch entomological societies, about beetles and moths in certain reserves; they found significant drops (72 percent, 54 percent) that mirrored the Krefeld ones. Roel van Klink, a researcher at the German Center for Integrative Biodiversity Research, told me that before Krefeld, he, like most entomologists, had never been interested in biomass. Now he is looking for historical data sets \u2014 many of which began as studies of agricultural pests, like a decades-long study of grasshoppers in Kansas \u2014 that could help create a more thorough picture of what\u2019s happening to creatures that are at once abundant and imperiled. So far he has found forgotten data from 140 old data sets for 1,500 locations that could be resampled.\\r\\nIn the United States, one of the few long-term data sets about insect abundance comes from the work of Arthur Shapiro, an entomologist at the University of California, Davis. In 1972, he began walking transects in the Central Valley and the Sierras, counting butterflies. He planned to do a study on how short-term weather variations affected butterfly populations. But the longer he sampled, the more valuable his data became, offering a signal through the noise of seasonal ups and downs. \u201cAnd so here I am in Year 46,\u201d he said, nearly half a century of spending five days a week, from late spring to the end of autumn, observing butterflies. In that time he has watched overall numbers decline and seen some species that used to be everywhere \u2014 even species that \u201ceveryone regarded as a junk species\u201d only a few decades ago \u2014 all but disappear. Shapiro believes that Krefeld-level declines are likely to be happening all over the globe. \u201cBut, of course, I don\u2019t cover the entire globe,\u201d he added. \u201cI cover I-80.\u201d\\r\\nThere are also new efforts to set up more of the kind of insect-monitoring schemes researchers wish had existed decades ago, so that our current level of fallenness, at least, is captured. One is a pilot project in Germany similar to the Danish car study. To analyze what is caught, the researchers turned to volunteer naturalists, hobbyists similar to the ones in Krefeld, with the necessary breadth of knowledge to know what they\u2019re looking at. \u201cThese are not easy species to identify,\u201d says Aletta Bonn, of the German Center for Integrative Biodiversity Research, who is overseeing the project. (The skills required for such work \u201care really extreme,\u201d Dunn says. \u201cThese people train for decades with other amateurs to be able to identify beetles based on their genitalia.\u201d) Bond would like to pay the volunteers for their expertise, she says, but funding hasn\u2019t caught up to the crisis. That didn\u2019t stop the \u201camateurs\u201d from being willing to help: \u201cThey said, \u2018We\u2019re just curious what\u2019s in there, we would like to have samples.\u2019\u2009\u201d\\r\\nGoulson says that Europe\u2019s tradition of amateur naturalism may account for why so many of the clues to the falloff in insect biodiversity originate there. (Tottrup\u2019s design for the car net in Denmark, for example, was itself adapted from the invention of a dedicated beetle-collecting hobbyist.) As little as we know about the status of European bugs, we know significantly less about other parts of the world. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t know anything if it weren\u2019t for them,\u201d the so-called amateurs, Goulson told me. \u201cWe\u2019d be entirely relying on the fact that there\u2019s no bugs on the windshield.\u201d\\r\\nThomas believes that this naturalist tradition is also why Europe is acting much faster than other places \u2014 for example, the United States \u2014 to address the decline of insects: Interest leads to tracking, which leads to awareness, which leads to concern, which leads to action. Since the Krefeld data emerged, there have been hearings about protecting insect biodiversity in the German Bundestag and the European Parliament. European Union member states voted to extend a ban on neonicotinoid pesticides and have begun to put money toward further studies of how abundance is changing, what is causing those changes and what can be done. When I knocked on the door of de Kroon\u2019s office, at Radboud University in the Dutch city Nijmegen, he was looking at some photos from another meeting he had that day: Willem-Alexander, the king of the Netherlands, had taken a tour of the city\u2019s efforts to make its riverside a friendlier habitat for bugs.\\r\\nStemming insect declines will require much more than this, however. The European Union already had some measures in place to help pollinators \u2014 including more strictly regulating pesticides than the United States does and paying farmers to create insect habitats by leaving fields fallow and allowing for wild edges alongside cultivation \u2014 but insect populations dropped anyway. New reports call for national governments to collaborate; for more creative approaches such as integrating insect habitats into the design of roads, power lines, railroads and other infrastructure; and, as always, for more studies. The necessary changes, like the causes, may be profound. \u201cIt\u2019s just another indication that we\u2019re destroying the life-support system of the planet,\u201d Lister says of the Puerto Rico study. \u201cNature\u2019s resilient, but we\u2019re pushing her to such extremes that eventually it will cause a collapse of the system.\u201d\\r\\nScientists hope that insects will have a chance to embody that resilience. While tigers tend to give birth to three or four cubs at a time, a ghost moth in Australia was once recorded laying 29,100 eggs, and she still had 15,000 in her ovaries. The fecund abundance that is insects\u2019 singular trait should enable them to recover, but only if they are given the space and the opportunity to do so.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s a debate we need to have urgently,\u201d Goulson says. \u201cIf we lose insects, life on earth will. ...\u201d He trailed off, pausing for what felt like a long time.\\r\\nIn Denmark, Sune Boye Riis\u2019s transect with his car net took him past a bit of woods, some suburban lawns, some hedges, a Christmas-tree farm. The closest thing to a meadow that we passed was a large military property, on which the grass had been allowed to grow tall and golden. Riis had received instructions not to drive too fast, so traffic backed up behind us, and some people began to honk. \u201cWell,\u201d Riis said, \u201cso much for science.\u201d After three miles, he turned around and drove back toward the start. His windshield stayed mockingly clean.\\r\\nRiis had four friends who were also participating in the study. They had a bet going among them: Who would net the biggest bug? \u201cI\u2019m way behind,\u201d Riis said. \u201cA bumblebee is in the lead.\u201d His biggest catch? \u201cA fly. Not even a big one.\u201d\\r\\nAt the end of the transect, Riis stopped at another parlous roadside spot, unfastened the net and removed the small bag at its tip. Some volunteers, captivated by what the study revealed about the world around them, asked the organizers for extra specimen bags, so they could do more sampling on their own. Some even asked if they could buy the entire car-net apparatus. Riis, though, was content to peer through the mesh, inside of which he could make out a number of black specks of varying tininess.\\r\\nThere was also a single butterfly, white-winged and delicate. Riis thought of the bet with his friends, for which the meaning of bigness had not been defined. He wondered how it might be reckoned. What gave a creature value?\\r\\n\u201cIs it weight?\u201d he asked, staring down at the butterfly. In the big bag, it looked small and sad and alone. \u201cOr is it grace?\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":828589318,\"description\":\"What does it mean for the rest of life on Earth?\\r\",\"title\":\"Feature: The Insect Apocalypse Is Here\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.36.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"\\n\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":123527015,\"description\":\"Cockroaches deploy a stunning, and largely unstudied, karate-style kick to prevent wasp attacks.\\r\",\"title\":\"The Cockroach Karate Kick That Fends Off Wasps\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.38.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"We\u2019ve long heard warnings that the Social Security program that 52 million Americans rely on for their retirement benefits could one day run out of money.\\r\\nAnalysts say that\u2019s not going to happen \u2014 if only because older people are such a powerful voting force \u2014 but this year the system has hit a worrisome milestone: the Social Security Administration reported that the retirement benefits paid out each month exceeded the tax revenues and interest that fund the program.\\r\\nThat necessitated the first dip into the Social Security Trust Fund in 35 years. By 2034, the agency estimated, it will have depleted those reserves, and its revenues will cover only about four-fifths of its promised benefits.\\r\\n\u201cThere\u2019s a problem, but not a crisis,\u201d said Andrew Eschtruth, a researcher at the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. \u201cIt\u2019s something policymakers have acted on before, and the program has always paid full benefits.\u201d\\r\\nMaking adjustments to keep Social Security solvent, crucial as that is, represents only one of the issues confronting Congress. It could also correct outdated aspects of a program that serves nearly 90 percent of Americans over 65.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good time to step back and try to make Social Security more effective,\u201d said Richard Johnson of the Urban Institute, author of a new report on raising the program\u2019s retirement age.\\r\\nThe fixes will likely include changes designed to bring more money in and pay less out. Imposing a higher payroll tax or raising the level of earnings subject to Social Security taxes (as of January 1, they will apply to the first $132,900, already an increase) would bolster revenues.\\r\\nMoney-saving measures could include reducing benefits for high earners and trimming the number of years that workers collect benefits by raising eligibility ages. Typically, such changes phase in for younger workers, not those already receiving Social Security or on the cusp of qualifying for benefits.\\r\\nThe demographic imperatives underlying these options are evident. With baby boomers retiring, the system has more beneficiaries to support. Longer life expectancies \u2014 about five additional years over the past several decades \u2014 and improved health have meant that \u201cpeople can certainly work longer than they could in 1960,\u201d Dr. Johnson said.\\r\\nSocial Security now allows workers to claim benefits at age 62, though they\u2019ll receive bigger checks if they wait until their full retirement ages (66 to 67) or beyond. The average monthly payment this year: $1347.46.\\r\\nWorking longer and claiming benefits later \u2014 trends already well underway \u2014 pay off in ways that extend beyond Social Security itself. \u201cIt\u2019s good for people, it\u2019s good for government tax revenues and it could fuel economic growth,\u201d Dr. Johnson said.\\r\\nBut as his report points out, living longer doesn\u2019t always mean people can work longer. Higher-income professionals may opt to stay on the job, he said, but \u201chealth problems are increasingly concentrated among less educated workers and they\u2019re falling further and further behind\u201d economically. Moreover, even those who could work often discover that \u201cemployers don\u2019t seem eager to hire 62 year olds.\u201d\\r\\nBy their early sixties, his analysis of national survey data found, a quarter of high school graduates and 37 percent of those without a high school diploma report work limitations related to their health. Many say their jobs require substantial physical effort.\\r\\nThe Urban Institute report suggests raising the early entitlement age to 65 and the full retirement age to 70, but building in safeguards for those who can\u2019t work, perhaps through Social Security\u2019s other programs.\\r\\nThe agency could provide a safety net by fattening benefits for the very low-income. It could expand its Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, restructure the way its disability insurance works or provide partial benefits for workers who aren\u2019t totally disabled.\\r\\nWhile some think tanks and congressional staffs are exploring ways to strengthen Social Security financially, others are looking into outmoded provisions that penalize beneficiaries, primarily women.\\r\\nSenator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, has introduced legislation intended to help widows, widowers and divorced spouses qualify for higher payments and receive benefits earlier if they\u2019re disabled.\\r\\n\u201cThis bill would boost the incomes of Social Security recipients who are most likely to be living in poverty, the majority of whom are women,\u201d Mr. Casey, ranking member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, said in a statement.\\r\\nSpeaking of women and Social Security, another effort would award work credit for those who temporarily leave the labor force because of caregiving responsibilities.\\r\\nIn the 1930s, when the Social Security Act was passed and then amended, policymakers assumed that women stayed home while men worked. Spousal and survivors benefits represented an attempt to provide for wives (and minor children) who had no work histories of their own.\\r\\n\u201cMajor demographic changes over 80 years have led to fewer women qualifying for spousal benefits,\u201d said Mr. Eschtruth, co-author of a recent international survey of caregiver credits.\\r\\nThe researchers found that 23 percent of Social Security dollars went to spousal and widows\u2019 benefits in 1960, compared to only 11 percent in 2016. That\u2019s partly because a growing proportion of women no longer marry, or have marriages that don\u2019t last 10 years, the threshold to qualify for divorced spouse benefits.\\r\\nIt also reflects the fact that as women have poured into the work force, they may qualify for Social Security retirement benefits based on their own work histories. But because women earn less and are more likely to have spent uncompensated years as caregivers, their retirement benefits can still suffer.\\r\\n\u201cTo what extent does society place a market value on caregiving?\u201d Mr. Eschtruth asked. The answer, at the moment, is that it barely does, at least in the United States.\\r\\nMost other industrialized countries credit some years of caregiving when calculating retirement benefits, the Boston College survey found. In the United Kingdom and Germany, those credits cover care of older people, as well as children.\\r\\nLegislation introduced by Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, last year would incorporate caregiving when calculating a person\u2019s future Social Security benefits. To qualify, a person would have had to provide 80 hours of care a month to a \u201cparent, spouse, domestic partner, sibling, child, aunt or uncle\u201d who needed assistance with daily activities. The caregiver would be credited with a modest wage for up to five years.\\r\\nAlas, none of these changes seems imminent.\\r\\nThe last time Congress made major adjustments to Social Security, in 1983, \u201cwe didn\u2019t get change until the trust fund was at high risk of being unable to pay benefits,\u201d Dr. Johnson said. This round, too, might involve brinkmanship and delay, at least until after the presidential election.\\r\\n\u201cAny kind of change is going to be painful for someone,\u201d he said, \u201cso there\u2019s a big incentive for Congress to kick the can down the road.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1350232161,\"description\":\"As Social Security dips into its trust fund, policymakers propose changes to fix the program\u2019s finances and strengthen its benefits, especially for women.\\r\",\"title\":\"The New Old Age: Social Security Runs Short of Money, and Ideas Fly on How to Repair It\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"health.36.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"HENGDIAN, China \u2014 If you are going to make a movie in China today about ancient warriors defending a mythical kingdom or a partisan resisting the Japanese occupation in the 1930s, or involving any variation of that staple of China\u2019s entertainment industry \u2014 the back-stabbing concubine drama \u2014 chances are you are going to make it in Hengdian.\\r\\nThe city is home to Hengdian World Studios, which claims to be the world\u2019s largest outdoor movie and television lot.\\r\\nTo call it a \u201clot\u201d is an understatement. It is not one lot, but 13 of them, scattered over 2,500 acres in and around what was once a sleepy farming village nestled in the hills of Zhejiang Province, in eastern China.\\r\\nThere are other studios in China \u2014 Shanghai Film Park, for example. Only in Hengdian, though, will you find a faithful recreation of the palace of Qin Shi Huang, who ruled in the third century B.C. near what is today known as Xi\u2019an, or of the capital of the Northern Song dynasty, which reigned from the 10th to the 12th centuries.\\r\\nThere is even a Forbidden City that is not only startlingly realistic, but also only a little bit smaller than the real thing in Beijing.\\r\\nThe one thing that might seem to be missing from its huge front gate is the photograph of Mao Zedong \u2014 except that the gate was constructed to look as it did during the Ming dynasty, not the later version known since the 17th century as Tiananmen.\\r\\n\u201cThese scenes today no longer exist,\u201d said Guo Huizhong, a director, as he filmed a war drama, whose title roughly translates as \u201cThe Last Bodyguard,\u201d inside a building reconstructed as an opera house from the first half of the 20th century.\\r\\nMoviemaking blurs the distinction between reality and fantasy, and Hengdian World Studios arguably does that better than any other place on Earth.\\r\\n\u201cThis is where the empress committed suicide,\u201d a studio assistant, Xu Hailei, explained as she guided an open cart through the faux Forbidden City, which, even up close, is pretty convincing.\\r\\n\u201cShe jumped from there,\u201d she went on, describing a historical fact of 18th-century China \u2014 the death of Empress Fucha \u2014 but also a pivotal scene in one of the most sensational dramas of the year, a 70-episode epic, \u201cThe Story of Yanxi Palace.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cYanxi Palace\u201d streamed on iQiyi, China\u2019s version of Netflix, from July to August, and continues to do so in China and dozens of other countries.

The two also set the stage for more painstaking negotiations to resolve deeply rooted differences over trade.\\r\\nThe compromise, struck over a steak dinner at the Group of 20 meeting here and announced in a White House statement, was less a breakthrough than a breakdown averted. The two leaders remain far apart on basic issues of market access and trade policy, and there was no sign that either planned to back down on those.\\r\\nStill, the handshake deal between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi, after what the White House called a \u201chighly successful meeting,\u201d pauses what was becoming a headlong race toward economic conflict. It will reassure jittery financial markets, as well as American farmers, who worried about the fallout from a prolonged trade battle.\\r\\nIn a significant concession, Mr. Trump will postpone a plan to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent, from 10 percent, on Jan. 1. The Chinese agreed to an unspecified increase in their purchases of American industrial, energy and agricultural products, which Beijing hit with retaliatory tariffs after Mr. Trump targeted everything from steel to consumer electronics.\\r\\nThe countries set an ambitious deadline of 90 days to reach a broader trade agreement, with the White House warning that if they did not come to terms by then, Mr. Trump would raise the existing tariff rate to 25 percent.\\r\\n\u201cThe relationship is very special \u2014 the relationship that I have with President Xi,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters as he sat across a long table from the Chinese leader before dinner was served. \u201cI think that is going to be a very primary reason why we\u2019ll probably end up with getting something that will be good for China and good for the United States.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Xi replied, \u201cOnly with cooperation between us can we serve the interest of world peace and prosperity.\u201d\\r\\nAs the dinner ended, the Chinese and American officials applauded the two leaders.\\r\\nFor Mr. Trump, the agreement was an upbeat end to his subdued visit to the G-20 meeting. He dodged unsavory friends, smiled through chilly encounters with allies and canceled a news conference out of respect for his predecessor, George Bush, whose death Friday was a reminder of the role that American presidents once played at these gatherings.\\r\\nOn his second day in Buenos Aires, Mr. Trump said little about global security or diplomacy, keeping a single-minded focus on trade. That put leaders like Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany in an awkward position, because Germany, as a member of the European Union, cannot negotiate by itself with the United States on trade issues.\\r\\n\u201cWe have a tremendous trade imbalance, but we\u2019re going to get that straightened out,\u201d he said before meeting Ms. Merkel on Saturday morning. \u201cWe all understand each other.\u201d\\r\\nAmerican and Chinese officials conducted quiet talks about a compromise over the last several weeks. But the outcome remained in doubt until the end, when Mr. Trump, flanked by his top aides, sat down with Mr. Xi and his aides to a meal of grilled sirloin and bottles of Malbec.\\r\\nMr. Trump had veered from optimism to wariness about a deal, sometimes in the course of a single statement. His economic team offered sharply conflicting advice, with moderates like Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin counseling compromise, while hard-liners like Peter Navarro, the White House director of trade, urged him to double down on his pressure.\\r\\nThe moderates tried to exclude Mr. Navarro from the trip. But at the dinner in a Buenos Aires hotel, he was there at the table, seated between the national security adviser, John R. Bolton, and the chief of staff, John Kelly. He leaned forward to listen to the president as he urged Mr. Xi to crack down on illicit shipments of the deadly opioid fentanyl.\\r\\nThe White House said that Mr. Xi, in a \u201chumanitarian gesture,\u201d had agreed to designate fentanyl as a controlled substance.\\r\\nChina was quick to portray the agreement as a concession by Mr. Trump. Wang Shouwen, the vice commerce minister, said the president had agreed to revoke his plan to raise tariffs on certain Chinese goods to 25 percent, according to Reuters.\\r\\nThe Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, said, \u201cChina is willing to expand imports according to the needs of the domestic market and the people,\u201d which he said would \u201cgradually ease the problem of trade imbalance.\u201d\\r\\nOf the roughly $250 billion worth of Chinese goods targeted by tariffs, $50 billion is already taxed at 25 percent, while the remaining $200 billion is taxed at 10 percent. As part of a series of tit-for-tat moves, Mr. Trump said he would raise the tariff for all goods to 25 percent and consider imposing tariffs on an additional $267 billion worth of exports.\\r\\nSome experts said the forces Mr. Trump had set in motion with Beijing would be hard to restrain. The United States is demanding sweeping changes in China\u2019s trade policy, which the Communist government might find politically difficult to enact and impossible to enforce.\\r\\nAnd the 90-day deadline is exceptionally ambitious for a trade agreement that has eluded negotiators for nearly two years.\\r\\n\u201cA halt in the tariff wars will be welcome but won\u2019t alter the fundamental collision course that Trump and Xi seem to be on,\u201d said Daniel M. Price, a former trade adviser to President George W. Bush.\\r\\nThe White House, he said, continued to tighten export controls and to bar Chinese high-technology firms like Huawei from American infrastructure projects. It is also lining up other countries to clamp down on the forced transfer of technology to China \u2014 all steps that will provoke Beijing.\\r\\nStill, Mr. Trump was a less disruptive presence at this gathering than he has been at previous ones. The G-20 members agreed on a 31-point communiqu\u00e9 that reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris climate accord, even as the United States reiterated its decision to pull out of it.\\r\\n\u201cAll countries except the U.S. backed conclusions reaffirming the Paris Agreement and its full implementation,\u201d Laurence Tubiana, the former French climate negotiator and now head of the European Climate Foundation, said in a statement.\\r\\nThe statement also expressed concern that the World Trade Organization should be reformed. The W.T.O. is a favorite target of Mr. Trump because he believes it crimps America\u2019s ability to use tariffs and allows countries like China to cheat.\\r\\n\u201cThe system is currently falling short of its objectives and there is room for improvement,\u201d the communiqu\u00e9 said, in a phrase that an administration official described as a victory for Mr. Trump.\\r\\nThe statement did not include a reference to the dangers of protectionism, which American officials said could have held it up. Two weeks ago, a feud over language on trade between China and the United States stymied the drafting of a communiqu\u00e9 after an economic summit meeting in Papua New Guinea \u2014 and it was never issued.\\r\\nBy contrast, this meeting was relatively harmonious, with Mr. Bush\u2019s death eliciting expressions of condolence from Ms. Merkel and Mr. Xi, who praised his role in advancing American-Chinese relations. In 1974 and 1975, Mr. Bush headed the United States liaison office to the People\u2019s Republic of China, a forerunner of the American Embassy.\\r\\nBy canceling his news conference, Mr. Trump avoided a platform where his freewheeling and provocative remarks could have emphasized differences with allies and adversaries alike. Instead, he struck a somber tone, praising Mr. Bush and his legacy in all his meetings.\\r\\n\u201cThe fact that we lost a president who truly was a wonderful person, a wonderful man, a great man \u2014 it really puts a damper on it, to be honest with you,\u201d Mr. Trump said as he sat next to Ms. Merkel.\\r\\nHe invited the chancellor to share a recollection of a visit she made to the White House with then-Chancellor Helmut Kohl, when Mr. Bush was still president. She referred to him as \u201cone of the fathers of the German unification,\u201d adding, \u201cwe will never forget that.\u201d\\r\\nEven before Mr. Bush\u2019s death, the meeting was shadowed by Mr. Trump\u2019s legal troubles back home \u2014 his former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about his dealings with Russia on behalf of Mr. Trump \u2014 and by his truncated schedule in Buenos Aires.\\r\\nThis was the kind of diplomatic conclave at which Mr. Bush, a globe-trotting foreign-policy president, would have thrived. But Mr. Trump\u2019s experience was less comfortable.\\r\\nHe skipped meetings with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, two strongmen he has drawn close but who have fallen into disrepute.\\r\\nMr. Putin has come under criticism for a clash last week between Russian and Ukrainian naval vessels, while the C.I.A. concluded that Prince Mohammed played a role in the killing of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in October.\\r\\nMr. Trump\u2019s stubborn defense of Prince Mohammed has aggravated tensions with Turkey, which shared an audio recording of the attack on Mr. Khashoggi with the director of the C.I.A., Gina Haspel, and demanded a fuller accounting from the Saudis of what happened.\\r\\nOn Saturday, Mr. Trump met with Turkey\u2019s leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, but the White House closed the session to even the brief picture-taking opportunity that usually accompanies these meetings.\\r\\nAt a dinner for the leaders on Friday night, the White House said Mr. Trump spoke informally with Mr. Putin. There were photos of the president and the first lady, Melania Trump, seated at the long table, separated from Mr. Putin by Mr. Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1255594662,\"description\":\"In a meeting with President Xi Jinping of China, President Trump agreed to hold off on a plan to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods on Jan. 1.\\r\",\"title\":\"U.S. and China Call Truce in Trade War\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"world.29.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"The first thing that the wedding planner Lauren Carson noticed at the end of eight weeks of strikes against Marriott hotels in Hawaii was the quiet.

There, workers at the Cambria Hotel Chicago Magnificent Mile, part of the Choice Hotels International chain, remain on strike, while United Here reached a deal with the other hotels. \\r\\nWhat\u2019s the dispute about? \\r\\nIn San Francisco, issues include health care coverage and wages, which the union said haven\u2019t kept up with the cost of living in the Bay Area. When the previous contract expired, the median income for its employees was $44,000, the union said. The housekeepers also want better protection from sexual harassment, and more time to clean the rooms that aren\u2019t serviced daily as part of Marriott\u2019s \u201cMake A Green Choice\u201d program, which offers incentives to guests who forgo daily housekeeping.\\r\\nMarriott International has management or franchise agreements with about 6,700 hotels under 30 brands in 130 countries and territories. \\r\\nWhat did the settlements include? \\r\\nDetails of the financial packages with Marriott won\u2019t be released until an agreement is reached in San Francisco. But deals have been reached covering 5,200 employees at 16 Marriott-operated properties, including seven in Boston, and one hotel each in Detroit, San Jose, Calif., Oakland, Calif., and San Diego.\\r\\n All of the contracts with Marriott thus far cover job security, worker involvement in the use of technology and a reduction in workload for housekeepers, the union said. Although Hawaii doesn\u2019t have the \u201cMake A Green Choice\u201d program, the room quota for housekeepers there was reduced by one room per day, to 13 rooms, at most of the hotels.\\r\\nThe new contracts also mean that housekeepers will be provided with a silent panic button to summon help if they feel threatened, in an effort to address sexual harassment. And in a move to address the effects of mass incarceration on job seekers, those with minor nonviolent drug offenses will be able to hold union jobs, Ms. Gumpert said. \\r\\nIn Hawaii and Boston, the deals also covered a so-called child\/elder fund in which Marriott sets aside money to assist with the cost of caring for young children or older relatives, she said. Hawaii also included an increase in health and pension contributions.\\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased to have ratified contracts in both Boston and Hawaii and are welcoming associates back at work,\u201d Ms. Kim, the Marriott spokeswoman, said.\\r\\nWhat are the hotels doing for inconvenienced travelers? \\r\\nEven with most of the hotels back to normal, the headache isn\u2019t over for everyone. Rebecca Walsh of Sydney, Australia, and her friends stayed in three rooms at the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani from Oct. 12 through 15.

It\u2019s also the most detailed guide yet to all the ways the country will have to adapt.\\r\\nEven if the nations of the world get their act together and slash fossil-fuel emissions rapidly, the United States will need to spend many billions of dollars to harden coastlines, rebuild sewer systems and overhaul farming practices to protect against floods, wildfires and heat waves that are already causing havoc nationwide. And the more that emissions rise, the more difficult and costly that task gets.\\r\\nThe United States isn\u2019t prepared. In the Midwest, the report notes, only four counties and cities have written climate change plans. This in a region where scientists are forecasting bigger crop failures and heavier floods that could cripple transportation networks. And at the federal level, the Trump administration is rolling back policies to take future sea-level rise into account when building new roads and railways.\\r\\nBelow are five major steps the scientific report says the country will need to take in the decades ahead:\\r\\n1. Rethink how we farm\\r\\nThe nation\u2019s food supply could be in jeopardy as global warming intensifies, the report warns. Crop yields for corn, wheat and soy tend to decline as the number of extremely hot days increases. More frequent droughts could reduce supplies of irrigation water. Dairy cows produce less milk in the sweltering heat.\\r\\nFarmers will have to rethink their practices in response. \\r\\nIn areas at risk of drought, they could use more precise irrigation techniques to conserve water. Agricultural regions could build new weather networks that provide more detailed climate forecasts, to help farmers make better decisions about which crops to plant, and when. In places like the Great Plains, dairy farmers and ranchers may need to relocate production or invest in climate-controlled buildings to protect their cattle from heat stress.\\r\\nBut the report emphasizes, \u201cthese approaches have limits under severe climate change impacts.\u201d\\r\\nOne hope is that seed companies might develop new crop varieties that are better able to tolerate drought, heat waves and pests. However, the report cautions that \u201cprogress in this area has been modest\u201d and calls for much greater public investment. \\r\\n2. Build for the future, not the past\\r\\nMuch of the nation\u2019s infrastructure, including things like roads and sewers, was built with historical weather conditions in mind. But as extreme weather becomes more frequent, the report says, the past is no longer a good guide to the future.\\r\\nIn Hampton Roads, Va., nearly half of residents reported being unable to drive out of their neighborhoods at some point last year because of flooding at high tide as sea levels have risen. In the Northeast, sewer systems built for the storms of the past are expected to overflow more frequently as climate change brings heavier rainfall.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s still not standard practice for engineers to think about future climate,\u201d said Costa Samaras, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. While a few cities, like New York and Baltimore, have begun using climate forecasts in their infrastructure planning, he said, \u201cit\u2019s not as widespread as it needs to be.\u201d\\r\\n3. Retreat from the coasts\\r\\nDepending on how rapidly emissions increase, global sea levels are likely to rise between 1 and 4 feet (or even more) this century, the report says, potentially putting trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of coastal homes and businesses in the United States at risk of flooding.\\r\\nWhile large cities like New York and Boston will likely invest heavily in sea walls, tide gates and pumping stations, they won\u2019t be able to protect everyone. In places like Norfolk, Va., officials are already pondering the prospect of relocating certain vulnerable neighborhoods.\\r\\nUltimately, the report warns, millions of people nationwide may have to move away from the coasts. Yet most policymakers are reluctant to even broach the topic. Many local governments, in search of more tax revenue, still promote development along coastlines. And a bevy of federal policies, such as subsidized flood insurance and efforts to rebuild communities in place after disasters, still discourage people from moving away from at-risk areas.\\r\\nKatherine Greig, a senior fellow at the Wharton Risk Center and co-author of the report\u2019s chapter on adaptation, said that \u201cWe\u2019re still a long ways\u201d from having \u201ca serious conversation about retreat.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Enlist nature to help\\r\\nClimate adaptation isn\u2019t just a matter of redesigning roads or power plants to be more resilient to extreme weather. The report also details ways that our natural environment, if managed properly, can be a cost-effective defense against climate change.\\r\\nPlanting more trees in cities can help reduce urban temperatures and protect people from deadly heat waves. Restoring degraded wetlands and marshes can protect cities and coasts from flooding and improve water quality. Healthy forests that are allowed to burn at a low level periodically, as they did in the distant past, are less prone to extreme wildfires. Protecting pollinators could help make our agricultural system more resilient.\\r\\nOne example from the report: Several Midwestern cities, including Milwaukee, have begun a large-scale effort to restore streams to their natural state, removing concrete linings, so that they can safely carry away more water during heavy storms.\\r\\n5. Expect the unexpected\\r\\nAs detailed as the new 1,656-page climate assessment is, the authors still warn that global warming is likely to bring unpredictable dangers, particularly as complex systems like energy, water, transportation and public health all come under severe stress at once.\\r\\nAs an example, Hurricane Harvey in Texas last year ended up shutting down gasoline refineries, straining hospitals, clogging roadways and spreading toxins and pathogens as floodwaters swamped the city. These sorts of \u201ccascading failures\u201d are difficult to study and predict in advance.\\r\\nAt a broad level, the report warns that officials at every level of government and in every corner of the economy will have to weave climate change into their decisions, to plan for a wide range of possible futures, and to continually re-evaluate those plans. \u201cAdaptation entails a continuing risk management process,\u201d the report notes. \u201cIt does not have an end point.\u201d\\r\\nFor more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1319101012,\"description\":\"A sweeping new climate report warns that the United States will have to spend billions of dollars to protect coastlines, rebuild sewers and overhaul farming.

But if we\u2019re clean but every other place on Earth is dirty, that\u2019s not so good. So I want clean air. I want clean water. Very important.\u201d \\r\\nThe remarks fit a pattern, and not just for their bluntness. In almost two years since taking office, Mr. Trump has denied the scientific reality of climate change and taken aggressive steps that will increase emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases \u2014 despite unequivocal scientific evidence that those pollutants are warming the planet to dangerous levels.\\r\\n\u201cSince virtually the first day the administration came into office they have systematically worked to reverse policies in place to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d said Robert N. Stavins, a professor of environmental economics at Harvard. \u201cBut this report, which is mandated by law, shows that greenhouse gas emissions are going to have profound effects on the United States in this century.\u201d\\r\\nThe report Mr. Trump referred to, the National Climate Assessment, issued on Friday, was the product of four years of work by 13 federal agencies. It concluded that \u201cEarth\u2019s climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities,\u201d and adds, \u201cthe severity of future impacts will depend largely on actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d\\r\\nThose impacts include more devastating wildfires, severe storms and coastal flooding, droughts, crop failures, water shortages, threats to public health and the loss of hundreds of billions of dollars to the American economy, according to the authors. \\r\\nBut in his disregard for scientific evidence, Mr. Trump has made the dismantling of policies to curb greenhouse pollution a centerpiece of his deregulatory agenda.\\r\\nThe most direct way the Trump administration is working to allow more greenhouse gas emissions is by weakening the Obama-era regulations meant to reduce pollution at its source: the smokestacks of power plants and tailpipes of automobiles.\\r\\n\\r\\nA \u2018calculated effort\u2019 on coal\\r\\nIn 2015 the Obama administration put forward its signature climate measure, the Clean Power Plan, designed to cut greenhouse pollution from power plants 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. That would be the equivalent of preventing more than 365 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere.\\r\\nBy contrast, the Trump administration\u2019s replacement unveiled in August, known as the Affordable Clean Energy rule, sets no national benchmark. It aims to cut carbon dioxide emissions from 2005 levels by 0.7 to 1.5 percent by 2030.\\r\\nAccording to estimates by environmental groups, that means the amount of carbon dioxide emitted from American power plants over the next decade could be up to 12 times higher than it would have been under the Obama-era plan.\\r\\n\u201cThese are life-extension projects for coal plants,\u201d said Jody Freeman, a Harvard law professor and former counsel to the Obama administration. \u201cIt\u2019s a very calculated effort to go in the opposite direction from what\u2019s needed.\u201d\\r\\nThe \u2018exact opposite signal\u2019 on car emissions\\r\\nIn 2012, the Obama administration put forth a major regulation on planet-warming pollution from vehicle tailpipes, requiring automakers to nearly double the fuel economy of passenger vehicles to an average of about 54 miles per gallon by 2025.\\r\\nIf fully implemented, the plan would have cut about six billion tons of greenhouse gas pollution over its lifetime, the equivalent of roughly a year\u2019s worth of greenhouse pollution for the entire country. \\r\\nIn August, the Trump administration published a proposal designed to drastically weaken that rule, freezing average fuel economy standards after 2021 at about 37 miles per gallon. While that rollback is not yet final, early analysis shows that it could lead to the increase of up to a billion tons of greenhouse gas pollution from 2012 levels. \\r\\n\u201cThey were a big deal because vehicle travel is one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d said David G. Victor, director of the Laboratory on International Law and Regulation at the University of California, San Diego, of the Obama-era tailpipe rules.\\r\\n\u201cAnd they sent a long-term signal to Detroit that they need to make vehicles that produce fewer emissions,\u201d Dr. Victor said. \u201cAttempting to loosen them has sent the exact opposite signal to Detroit.\u201d\\r\\nMore methane in the atmosphere\\r\\nThe Trump administration isn\u2019t only loosening Obama-era efforts to curb carbon dioxide emissions. It has also taken multiple steps to make it easier for oil and gas companies to release methane into the atmosphere.\\r\\nMethane is a potent greenhouse gas \u2014 about 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide in its ability to trap heat in the atmosphere. It is emitted from landfills and coal-fired power plants, burned as part of oil drilling operations and routinely leaked into the atmosphere from faulty oil and gas wells.\\r\\nUnder Mr. Trump, both the E.P.A. and the Interior Department have proposed weakening Obama-era requirements that companies repair and monitor methane leaks in wells. New rules under consideration would also loosen restrictions on \u201cflaring,\u201d the burning of methane from drilling operations.\\r\\nThe Obama administration had estimated its steps to regulate methane would prevent the equivalent of 11 million tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere by 2025. \\r\\nExperts say a rise in methane emissions is an inevitable consequence of Mr. Trump\u2019s rollbacks.\\r\\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that dumping the venting-and-flaring rule is causing increases in emissions,\u201d said David J. Hayes, a former deputy secretary of the interior during the Clinton and Obama administrations.\\r\\nA global leadership void\\r\\nFinally, there is the Trump administration\u2019s vow to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, a voluntary accord under which nearly every country in the world has agreed to reduce emissions.\\r\\nPresident Barack Obama pledged the United States would cut carbon at least 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. The Trump administration cannot formally withdraw from the Paris pact for two more years, but in rolling back key climate regulations it has effectively stopped all efforts to meet that goal.\\r\\nBut the United States\u2019 role in the Paris Agreement was never just about driving down America\u2019s own emissions. It was also about using its leadership to prod major developing countries like China, India and Brazil to also reduce their emissions despite still climbing out of poverty. Those countries, under United Nations rules agreed to by the United States in the 1990s, also are not legally obligated to cut carbon because of their status as developing nations.\\r\\n\u201cWhen the U.S. is not taking action on climate it makes it incredibly difficult for countries with lesser means than ours to take action themselves,\u201d said Richard G. Newell, president of Resources for the Future, a nonpartisan Washington-based research organization.\\r\\nAlready Mr. Trump\u2019s actions seem to be reverberating in rich and poor countries alike. Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, has threatened to pull out of the Paris Agreement. His conservative government has since said it will honor its pledges, but the country\u2019s energy policy contains no plans for curbing emissions.\\r\\nIn Brazil, the far-right populist President-elect Jair Bolsonaro campaigned on a vow of pulling out of the Paris Agreement.\\r\\nChina, on the other hand, has worked to position itself as the new leader on climate change.\\r\\nCountries will meet in December in Katowice, the heart of Poland\u2019s coal country, to finalize a set of rules for implementing the Paris Agreement. The United States will attend the talks and, despite the intended rollbacks, is expected to push other countries to be more transparent about their own plans for cutting emissions.\\r\\nFor more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1205115323,\"description\":\"Since his earliest days in office, President Trump has been taking steps that increase emissions of the heat-trapping greenhouse gases that are warming the planet to dangerous levels.\\r\",\"title\":\"How Trump Is Ensuring That Greenhouse Gas Emissions Will Rise\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.40.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"One contestant, Elizabeth James of Tanzania, said she had been forced to change schools as a child when people, staring and pointing, started trailing her home.\\r\\nAnother, Okwii Simon Peter, a 26-year-old Ugandan lawyer, said he was taking part to demonstrate that living with albinism does not make him different.\\r\\nValencia Bosibori, 25, a customer care executive at a telecom firm in Kenya, said she wanted to \u201creach people who don\u2019t have that knowledge of what albinism is.\u201d\\r\\nThey all took part in a groundbreaking beauty pageant, the first Mr. and Miss Albinism East Africa pageant, on Friday night in Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi.\\r\\n The aim was to affirm the dignity of people who have faced discrimination, violence and even murder because of their hereditary lack of pigmentation.\\r\\nA similar event held in 2016 was open only to Kenyans, according to The Associated Press.

But when Benyamin keeps crying, she takes him to the balcony and points to the brightest star shining through Kabul\u2019s polluted sky.\\r\\n\u201cAba is there,\u201d she says.\\r\\nThe war in Afghanistan is disproportionately killing young men, and it is leaving behind a generation defined by that loss. Children like Benyamin will have only early memories of their fathers, and the deaths will shape their lives even as true recollections fade. Babies like Sarfarz will have even less, with death taking fathers they will never know.\\r\\n[Get a weekly roundup of Times coverage of war delivered to your inbox.

Like Mrs. Kakar, they are left to raise families in a country with a dearth of economic opportunity and plagued by a war that kills 50 people a day.\\r\\nAnd more, the women are made painfully aware that their society sees them as possessions. A new widow often must rely completely on her husband\u2019s family, which is likely to demand that she marry the next available brother or cousin. The women usually have little say, though some try to resist.\\r\\nOver months this year, as Afghanistan\u2019s long war took an even deadlier turn, we followed several young women making the cruel transition to widowhood.\\r\\nOvernight, their lives became a struggle that deprived them of even the chance to mourn. For a couple of them, including Mrs. Kakar, their grief was punctuated by the pain of childbirth, bringing babies into a world consumed by despair. Reminders of their lost loves became their anchors in a newly unstable world.\\r\\nRahila Shams was also widowed \u2014 at age 22, six months pregnant with her second daughter. Her husband, Ali Dost Shams, a district governor, was killed in a Taliban raid in April. When her daughter was born, the family named her Shamsia, after the father she will never meet.\\r\\n\u201cI lost my love, my friend, and the father of my two daughters. Everyone says, \u2018Stay strong,\u2019 but no one says how,\u201d Mrs. Shams said.\\r\\n\u201cI feel everything is finished. But I\u2019m trying to stay strong because I promised him that I\u2019d look after our daughters,\u201d she said.\\r\\nLove and Loss\\r\\nEach of the women said she had found love in marriage, even if it took time in a culture where arranged matches remain the rule.\\r\\nRahila was in the ninth grade in Malistan District, southwest of Kabul, when Mr. Shams, a distant relative, saw her at a wedding and sent his family to ask for her hand. She was half his age but found him handsome, she said, and he had been well on track for a government career.\\r\\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any beauty salon in our village,\u201d Mrs. Shams recalled. \u201cIt was a simple wedding party \u2014 I think about 1,000 people \u2014 simple and lovely.\u201d\\r\\nThe couple moved to Kabul, where she enrolled in nursing school. Mr. Shams became a district governor in Ghazni Province and was away from home for long periods. They had their first child, Sofia, four years into the marriage, which quickly was forged into a partnership. But Mrs. Shams now cannot help feeling that much of it was preparing her for the inevitability of a life on her own.\\r\\nFor Sabawoon and Mashal Kakar, their marriage was a love match from the start.\\r\\nThe two met while taking evening law classes. Both were young professionals with day jobs: Mashal worked for an aid organization, and Sabawoon as a radio journalist. Sabawoon had moved to Kabul from Helmand Province, the battlefield area where his family still lives. Their relationship blossomed over a year spent chatting on the phone and sneaking out of their offices for quiet lunch dates.\\r\\nAfter their families made their engagement official, the couple combined their savings \u2014 she was making more than he was \u2014 to buy an apartment. They decorated it piece by piece before they married.\\r\\n\u201cWe invited only 300 people to the wedding,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was enough for both of us. He was a good man and loved me a lot, and I love him, too \u2014 forever and for the rest of my life.\u201d\\r\\nTheir son Benyamin added joy to the fulfilling life they were building together.\\r\\nMrs. Kakar was at her desk at work the morning of April 30 when she got a message alerting her to an explosion in the Shashdarak neighborhood, where Mr. Kakar\u2019s office was.\\r\\n\u201cWhen I called him he picked up his phone and said, \u2018Mashal jan, I am dying,\u2019 \u201d Mrs. Kakar said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to tell him. I said, \u2018Stay strong, I am coming.\u2019 \u201d\\r\\nEight months pregnant, she arrived at the hospital and searched room to room until she found him on the second floor.\\r\\nSabawoon told her he had a hole in his back and might not make it, but as he was wheeled away for surgery, she thought he would. She sat down, exhausted, falling asleep as she plotted all the nutritious foods she would cook to help him recover.\\r\\nShe was woken up and told that Sabawoon had died. \u201cEverything turned dark, like night,\u201d Mrs. Kakar said.\\r\\nFor the Shams family, tragedy pierced the joy of Mr. Shams\u2019s expected return. The night before he was killed this past spring, he called his wife and their daughter, Sofia, and promised he would be home in a day or two. Sofia could not contain her excitement, jumping and chanting: \u201cMy Atai is coming! My Atai is coming!\u201d\\r\\nTaliban fighters stormed his office the next day and shot their way in. Mr. Shams had told his staff they should flee if they could, but no one left. All were killed.\\r\\nHis body was transported back to Kabul. \u201cThey just showed me his face, like a photo in a frame,\u201d Mrs. Shams said.\\r\\nStruggle for Hope\\r\\nIn the months after their husbands were killed, the young widows were not only grappling with grief and their children\u2019s confusion, but also dreading the inevitability of being passed along within their husbands\u2019 families.\\r\\nMrs. Kakar\u2019s in-laws called her and asked her to join them in Helmand \u2014 for a break, they said. She politely turned them down. They grew more blunt, she said, arguing it was not good for a young woman and her two children to be in Kabul on their own.\\r\\n\u201cI told them I\u2019m an educated woman and I can handle my life,\u201d Mrs. Kakar said.\\r\\nShe went back to work. But all along she had an eye on an exit. The everyday vulnerability of being a young, single woman in Afghanistan furthered her resolve to leave the country.\\r\\nShe started receiving unwanted messages from male friends and colleagues and felt like prey when taking care of paperwork alone in government offices. Yet asking male friends or family members for help would puncture the image of strength she was clinging to.\\r\\nAs months passed, Benyamin stopped asking when his father would come home. But at dusk he still grows restless.\\r\\n\u201cAfter Sabawoon\u2019s loss, I was numb, but my heart was burning,\u201d Mrs. Kakar said. \u201cI would ask other women who had lost their husbands whether the pain eases with time, and they would say, \u2018No, it does not.\u2019\u201d\\r\\nFor other women, the prospects are grim, their choices and say in shaping their futures much more limited.\\r\\nWithout a job, and still trying to complete her education, Mrs. Shams is bound to her husband\u2019s family. He had been earning about $900 a month as a district governor. The family is entitled some post-death benefits, but Mrs. Shams doesn\u2019t know the amount, as her husband\u2019s oldest brother collects the money. She said she was uncomfortable about asking because she and her children live at his house now.\\r\\nShe feels an implicit expectation that she should marry Mr. Shams\u2019s younger brother, though the topic has not been openly discussed. The brother-in-law is a more frequent presence in their lives and has grown more possessive, she said.\\r\\n\u201cI am afraid to get remarried,\u201d Mrs. Shams said just days before giving birth to Shamsia.\\r\\nMrs. Shams and her husband had known their second child would also be a girl, but she kept wishing the baby could somehow be a boy to take care of her and Sofia.\\r\\n\u201cIf my child is a son, he could save my life,\u201d she said during one visit to the gynecologist.\\r\\nThe doctor attempted to console her by telling a story of her own cousin who was killed in the west of the country just months earlier.\\r\\n\u201cYou are not alone,\u201d she told Mrs. Shams. \u201cThere are many women like you in Afghanistan.\u201d\\r\\nIn the hours after her healthy daughter was born, Mrs. Shams broke down.\\r\\n\u201cI was in pain, but the loneliness of it was much stronger,\u201d she said. \u201cI cried a lot \u2014 for being a woman, for being a widow at 22, for being the mother of two girls. I thought about the future, about Shams, about loneliness.\u201d\\r\\nShe added, \u201cI think loneliness is the strongest pain in the world.\u201d\\r\\nFor Sofia, her firstborn, the baby sister was a welcome distraction. But the older girl still struggled. Every time the phone rang, Sofia would think her father was on the line. She would cry and wanted to talk.\\r\\nMore recently, Sofia has stopped asking about him. She hates the phone, and has started referring to her uncle as father.\\r\\nBut the reminders of Mr. Shams will always be there, in the framed photos on the wall, in the visits to his grave, her hand in her mother\u2019s hand. And in something more personal, her birthday: On April 12, the day her father was killed, Sofia turned 3 years old.\\r\\nMrs. Shams recently felt a glimmer of hope. A relative told her he could help her find a job as a vaccinator, a small step toward breaking the shackles of dependence and shaping her own future.\\r\\nDays later, the relative was killed in a suicide bombing outside a demonstration in Kabul.\\r\\n\u201cI just want to leave this country and go somewhere peaceful,\u201d she said. \u201cSomewhere where no one is killed and no one loses their life.\u201d\\r\\n\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-2024329032,\"description\":\"The war in Afghanistan is disproportionately killing young men, leaving behind women with limited options.\\r\",\"title\":\"A Generation of Widows, Raising Children Who Will Be Forged by Loss\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"world.34.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"BERLIN \u2014 To Germans, the 41st president of the United States, George Bush, was the man who helped ensure the peaceful reunification of their country. To Mikhail Gorbachev, former leader of the Soviet Union, he exemplified great kindness. To many Kuwaitis, he was a hero for the 100-hour ground war that routed Iraqi forces from their country.\\r\\nOn Saturday, as former and current leaders around the globe learned of Mr. Bush\u2019s death at 94 on Friday night, their condolences were steeped in praise for the depth of his abilities as a statesman and his refusal to grandstand \u2014 which commentators noted was in sharp contrast to the tone of the current American administration.\\r\\n\u201cGermany owes a lot to George H.W. Bush,\u201d Chancellor Angela Merkel wrote in a telegram to President Trump. \u201cIt was a stroke of luck in German history that he was at the head of the United States of America when the Cold War came to an end and Germany\u2019s reunification became possible.\u201d\\r\\nMs. Merkel praised Mr. Bush for recognizing \u201cthe significance of this historical hour\u201d and giving Germans \u201chis trust and support.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cThe courageous and peaceful revolution of the people to the east of the Iron Curtain thus met with the courage and skill of a statesman who, together with others, led Europe and the trans-Atlantic partnership through this upheaval, ushering in a new era,\u201d she wrote.\\r\\nMr. Bush, often criticized at home for his measured response to the fall of the Iron Curtain, was lauded for that very quality abroad. His calm, controlled response to the end of Communism in Europe earned him respect on the Continent as a senior statesman, despite his decisions to send United States troops into Panama and to launch the 1991 Persian Gulf war.\\r\\nMikhail Gorbachev, the former president of the Soviet Union, underscored Mr. Bush\u2019s skillful negotiation among the former adversaries of the Cold War. \u201cWe had a chance to work together during the years of tremendous changes. It was a dramatic time that demanded great responsibility from everyone,\u201d he told the Interfax news agency. \u201cThe result was an end to the Cold War and the nuclear arms race.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Gorbachev said Mr. Bush \u201cwas a true partner\u201d at the diplomatic table, but above all one who showed kindness to him and to his wife, Raisa.\\r\\nOne example of Mr. Bush\u2019s approach: On the morning of Nov. 10, 1989, as news reached Washington that the Berlin Wall had fallen peacefully the previous night, Mr. Bush called Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany to wish him \u201clots of luck.\u201d\\r\\nHistorians have noted that while Ronald Reagan gets the credit for urging Mr. Gorbachev to \u201ctear down this wall,\u201d it was Mr. Bush who later succeeded in persuading the Soviet leader, as well as President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand of France and the deeply skeptical Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, to allow the two German nations to reunite.\\r\\n\u201cI will never forget the role he played in making Europe a safer and more united place following the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain,\u201d said Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission.\\r\\n\u201cPresident Bush\u2019s calmness, leadership and close personal relationships with Helmut Kohl and Mikhail Gorbachev were decisive in restoring peace and freedom back to so many people across our continent,\u201d Mr. Juncker said in a statement. \u201cWe Europeans will forever remember this.\u201d\\r\\nIn the tense months of 1989 and 1990, during the collapse of the Communist system that had controlled Eastern Europe for decades, the situation was delicate and demanded a leader in Washington who understood that it was not the moment to declare victory \u2014 despite domestic criticism that his response had not been forceful enough.\\r\\n\u201cAs the two blocs faltered and the decades-long confrontation began to break down, George H.W. Bush seized the courageous chance to end the Cold War,\u201d Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, wrote on Twitter. \u201cWe mourn a great statesman and a friend of Germany.\u201d\\r\\nLech Walesa, the former Polish president and leader of the Solidarity labor movement that helped to bring down Communism in his country, posted a picture on Twitter of himself standing arm in arm with Mr. Bush, their hands raised in \u201cV\u201d signs of victory. He, too, thanked Mr. Bush for his role in ending the Cold War.\\r\\n\u201cHe was the only one of the world leaders who at the time did much to bring down communism and help Poland,\u201d Mr. Walesa said. \u201cIt will remain forever in the hearts and memory.\u201d\\r\\nPresident Emmanuel Macron of France expressed his condolences to Mr. Bush\u2019s family in a message on Twitter, mourning a \u201cgreat leader who strongly supported the alliance with Europe.\u201d\\r\\nPresident Vladimir V.

Mr. Bush had strong opposition to the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, while Mr. Shamir\u2019s insisted on continued construction.\\r\\nBut Israeli leaders had praised Mr. Bush for helping to liberate Soviet Jewry, as well as for helping waves of Ethiopian Jews to reach Israel.

They all have a few things in common: a slight bitterness and a bright-red color. And bugs.\\r\\nYes, bugs. Many of these drinks use the natural dye carmine, which is extracted from the cochineal, a tiny insect, to achieve their vibrant hue. This is not some weird new craft-distilling trend: Cochineals (KAHCH-i-neels), native to the Americas, have been used for centuries to lend color to everything from fabric to cosmetics to food.\\r\\nFor decades, Campari was the most famous spirit to use crushed cochineals for coloring. The company decided in 2006 to discontinue its use in most of its bottlings, in favor of artificial colors, because of what it called the \u201cuncertainty of supply of the natural colorant.\u201d That would have seemed to be a death knell for the insect\u2019s future in liquor.\\r\\nIndeed, when Todd Leopold, head distiller of the Denver spirits company Leopold Bros., decided to make an aperitivo a few years ago, the main argument against cochineal was that \u201cnobody was using it,\u201d he said. \u201cCampari had stopped.\u201d\\r\\nNow, Mr. Leopold and a number of other craft distillers are going all in on cochineal. Its use may not sit well with certain groups, like vegans and those who keep kosher. But the spirit-makers contend that it\u2019s a better alternative to artificial dyes, most of which are derived from petroleum.\\r\\n\u201cGiven the option of petroleum byproduct and smushed-up bugs, the bugs won out,\u201d said Lance Winters, master distiller at St. George Spirits in Alameda, Calif., which uses cochineal in its Bruto Americano.\\r\\nThough the idea of drinking insect-tinted liquor may sound unappetizing, the dye is, after all, natural. \u201cWe try to do nothing that is not natural,\u201d said Francesco Amodeo, the president of Don Ciccio & Figli, in Washington. \u201cThe artificial dye will give you a funky taste all the way to the back.\u201d \\r\\nCochineal lends no aroma or flavor, and its use is traditional \u2014 something that appeals to craft distillers, a breed known for their allegiance to historical practices. \u201cWhy would you change tradition when it\u2019s been done that way for centuries?\u201d Mr. Amodeo asked.\\r\\nThe distillers go to some pains to follow that custom. Mr. Amodeo spent three years seeking a good source for cochineal, a search that held back the release of his aperitivo, called Cinque. He eventually found it in Peru and Bolivia. \\r\\nCochineal typically comes in either liquid or powdered form. A small amount (for St. George Spirits, a fraction of a gram per liter of alcohol) is needed to turn a distillate scarlet. The Food and Drug Administration requires that manufacturers who use cochineal or carmine say so on the label.\\r\\nGiven all this fuss, you might ask: Why do these aperitivos have to be red, anyway? Again, the answer seems to be tradition: It has always been done that way.\\r\\nAperitivos, Mr. Amodeo pointed out, are typically \u201csipped toward early afternoon until sunset. It kind of reflects the time of day.

A veteran executive from Nestl\u00e9 and Procter & Gamble, he was known for his fiscal discipline and international experience.\\r\\nBut Mr. Polman, who on Thursday announced that he would step down at the end of the year, quickly set about making dramatic changes when he took over Unilever.\\r\\nHe stopped issuing quarterly guidance, signaling to Wall Street that he was not going to make decisions to improve the short-term stock price. He rolled out a long-term strategy to make Unilever a better steward of the environment and a more socially responsible business, known as the Sustainable Living Plan.\\r\\nIn time, Mr. Polman, who is Dutch, began acquiring brands known for their ecological bona fides, like Seventh Generation and Tazo tea. And last year, he fended off a takeover attempt by Kraft Heinz, a deal that would have been a near-term win for investors but would have set up a clash of diametrically opposed corporate cultures.\\r\\nAs Unilever\u2019s chief, Mr. Polman emerged as one of the most prominent voices in the corporate world calling for changes to the status quo, encouraging big companies to reduce emissions, embrace renewable energy, improve conditions for workers and produce healthier products.\\r\\nHe served on a United Nations panel that created the Sustainable Development Goals. And in 2015, he was among the most prominent business leaders calling for world leaders to commit to the Paris climate accord.\\r\\n\u201cThere\u2019s been no one as clear and focused and all-in as Paul Polman in setting goals for his company, his supply chain and taking his words on the road,\u201d said Mindy Lubber, chief executive of Ceres, a nonprofit group that advocates for sustainable business. \u201cHis voice has made a difference. He\u2019s put his money where his mouth is.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Polman will be succeeded by Alan Jope, who has led Unilever\u2019s beauty and personal care division \u2014 its largest business \u2014 since 2011. Mr. Jope, a Scotsman, once appeared as a judge on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d with Donald J. Trump.\\r\\nIn an interview, Mr. Polman said he believed Mr. Jope would continue his efforts to promote sustainability and social responsibility.\\r\\n\u201cThat was one of the main criteria selection of the new C.E.O.,\u201d Mr. Polman said, adding that he believed many of those ideals were now embedded in the company.\\r\\n\u201cA responsible business model makes your brand stronger and improves corporate reputation, and that is reflected in the share price,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a very supportive board who understands that, even when they are tested in cases like Kraft Heinz. And the people and brands who have joined us have come because of the Sustainable Living Plan.\u201d\\r\\nBut as Mr. Polman departs, some wonder whether Unilever will continue to promote corporate responsibility, especially as consumer goods makers struggle with lagging sales, rising costs from tariffs and new competition from companies like Amazon.\\r\\n\u201cPaul has been a crucial voice for a more ethical and sustainable form of capitalism,\u201d said Aron Cramer, chief executive of Business for Social Responsibility, a trade group. \u201cBut consumer products companies are going through choppy waters. It will be essential that the board maintain its commitment to his vision.\u201d\\r\\nWhen Mr. Polman first took over at Unilever, financial analysts were skeptical of his new direction. During his first few months, which coincided with the financial crisis, Unilever\u2019s stock plummeted more than 27 percent. When he abolished quarterly guidance, shares fell 8 percent.\\r\\nBut since then, Unilever\u2019s stock price has shot up, more than doubling during Mr. Polman\u2019s tenure.\\r\\nMr. Polman managed to deliver strong financial results by acquiring new brands, expanding in emerging markets and enlarging the company\u2019s personal care business. At the same time, he championed the Sustainable Living Plan, which set ambitious goals such as cutting Unilever\u2019s environmental impact in half by 2030, while still improving sales.\\r\\nTo accomplish this, Mr. Polman gave managers wide latitude to make changes that could reduce water use and greenhouse gas emissions, improve soil health and create less waste.\\r\\nThe company has been transparent about its progress, issuing annual reports detailing its efforts, including improving working conditions in its supply chain and creating healthier products. For example, Unilever says that carbon dioxide emissions from its factories are down 47 percent from 2008 levels.\\r\\nBut success has been uneven. Unilever\u2019s push to use sustainable soy beans in Iowa to create a better mayonnaise has been inordinately complicated. And it notes that it is having a hard time meeting its goal of sourcing all agricultural raw materials sustainably by 2020. Last year, that figure was at just 56 percent.\\r\\nAnd while Mr. Polman has overseen strong, sustained growth at Unilever in recent years, his tenure hasn\u2019t been entirely smooth.\\r\\nThe bid from Kraft Heinz, whose board then included Warren E. Buffett, offered Unilever shareholders a roughly 18 percent premium to their stock. But Mr. Polman argued that Unilever would be worth more over the long term, and Kraft Heinz withdrew its offer.\\r\\nIn the aftermath, investors looked to Mr. Polman to improve profits and streamline the company, including an effort to reduce bureaucracy by doing away with a dual listing structure that includes two headquarters, in London and Rotterdam.\\r\\nIn March, Unilever announced it would make the Netherlands its sole headquarters, dealing a symbolic and economic blow to Britain in the wake of the Brexit vote. But such a move would have forced Unilever to leave the FTSE 100 stock index, in turn forcing several large mutual funds to sell their holdings. In October, Mr. Polman backtracked on the plan.\\r\\nOn Thursday, Mr. Polman said his effort to unite the company was among his greatest priorities in his last year on the job, but with the effort having faltered, he believed it was time to retire.\\r\\n\u201cI tried to do the job of unification, but it was a difficult environment,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the ship is steadied.

Last year there were roughly 175 homicides per day in Brazil, according to the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety. Often simulating gunfire with his fingers at campaign rallies, Mr. Bolsonaro said he would combat the homicide epidemic by easing firearm laws and giving the police more freedom to shoot suspects.\\r\\n\u201cWe have to stop this politically correct thing, saying that disarming everyone will make Brazil a better place \u2014 it won\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Bolsonaro said in his first post-election television interview, pointing out that the strict regulations now in place have failed to stem the flow of firearms into the hands of criminals.\\r\\nThese regulations were created at the turn of the 21st century, when civil society, faced with rising violence and the explosion of the cocaine trade in Brazil, stepped up pressure on the government to register firearms and regulate their use.\\r\\nCongress responded. A restrictive law known as the Disarmament Statute, approved in 2003, required applicants to be at least 25 years old, have no criminal history, provide proof of a steady job and fixed residence, pass a psychological test and have gun training.\\r\\nThe regulation also gave Brazilians two options: They can get a license for a self-defense firearm, which must be stored exclusively at home or at a place of work; or for a sporting weapon, which can be stored at home and carried to authorized shooting clubs, always with full documentation. In the case of a firearm for self-defense, the applicant must also formally declare why a gun is needed and have that argument approved by the police.\\r\\nFaced with such an onerous registration process, many gun owners opted to surrender their firearms.\\r\\nBrazil\u2019s murder rate declined 12 percent in the four years after the statute was approved. But then homicides started to climb again, setting a record in 2017 of 30.8 per 100,000 people, according to the Brazilian Forum of Public Security, a research organization. (The United States had five homicides per 100,000 people in 2015 \u2014 the most recent year for which data are available \u2014 down from eight per 100,000 in 1996. Even Mexico had a lower murder rate of 25 per 100,000 last year.)\\r\\nSales of legal firearms, which also diminished immediately after the Disarmament Statute was introduced, skyrocketed years later. By 2017, there were 42,387 new guns registered with the police, compared with 5,159 in 2004.\\r\\nMr. Bolsonaro\u2019s promise to ease gun regulation and give the police greater freedom to shoot is worrying some experts who argue that more guns fuel more violence and that police aggression needs to be curbed, not encouraged. The police in Brazil killed 5,144 people in 2017, a 20 percent increase over the year before.\\r\\nThe vast majority of firearms used by criminals were at one time legally acquired \u2014 and legal firearms also cause many deaths as a result of accidents, domestic abuse and disagreements that spiral out of control, said Ivan Marques, the executive director of the Sou da Paz Institute, which focuses on security issues.\\r\\nStudies show that having more firearms in circulation increases the number of deaths, but \u201cthere are no magic solutions,\u201d said Ilona Szab\u00f3, the director of the Igarap\u00e9 Institute, a research group that focuses on security issues. \u201cWe need sustainable measures that make the country safer.\u201d\\r\\nDespite the enthusiasm for Mr. Bolsonaro and anger over the public security crisis, most Brazilians \u2014 55 percent, in a poll conducted by Datafolha right before the elections \u2014 think civilian gun ownership should be banned, although this number has gone down from 68 percent in 2013, when the polling firm Datafolha first conducted a survey asking that question.\\r\\nLuciana Burr, a lawyer from S\u00e3o Paulo, says she has been robbed at gunpoint six times. The first time, she was 15 years old. Later, she was held up in a \u201cflash kidnapping\u201d with her 5-year-old son in the car. They were driven around for two hours while armed teenagers forced them to take cash out of A.T.M.s. Still, she staunchly opposes allowing citizens to carry guns, arguing that being armed would not have helped her.\\r\\n\u201cI was caught by surprise every single time,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t want some \u2018good citizen\u2019 deciding to step in with a gun. I don\u2019t want someone making that decision for me \u2014 the risk is too big.\u201d\\r\\nA number of proposals backed by the \u201cbullet lobby,\u201d a group of lawmakers, have been introduced in Congress in an effort to relax gun restrictions. Within days of Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s victory, representatives keen on impressing the president-elect pushed to vote on a bill, first introduced in 2012, that would lower the age limit for gun ownership to 21 and would not require applicants to prove the need to be armed.\\r\\nIt appears likely that they will vote on the bill after Jan. 1, when Mr. Bolsonaro and his new allies in Congress take office. Conservatives from his Social Liberal Party won 52 seats, up from eight, making it the second largest party in the lower house.\\r\\nStocks in the Brazilian firearm manufacturer Forjas Taurus surged more than 400 percent ahead of the presidential elections on expectations that a Bolsonaro victory would pave the way for a boom in sales, although financial concerns over the company have since eroded some of those gains.\\r\\nThe euphoria surrounding Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s rise in polls also prompted a flood of phone calls to the Centaurus shooting academy from people interested in courses, guidance on how laws could change, or target practice at its two-story house converted into a classroom and four-lane shooting range.\\r\\n\u201cThere has been a big surge in demand thanks to my man, Bolsonaro,\u201d said Nelson de Oliveira Jr., a former police officer who opened the Centaurus shooting academy in S\u00e3o Paulo in 2003, just before Brazil\u2019s then left-wing government introduced the Disarmament Statute.\\r\\nAmong them are the Ortegas, who signed up for gun training at the shooting academy and see the ability to carry a weapon as a deterrent to the kind of armed robbery Ms. Ortega says she suffered two months before Mr. Bolsonaro was elected.\\r\\n\u201cRight now, only the criminals have guns,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to run around the streets with a gun in my hand, but a criminal might think twice if normal citizens could be armed.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1101456095,\"description\":\"President-elect Jair Bolsonaro wants to make it easier for \u201cgood guys\u201d to own firearms, though most Brazilians think civilian gun ownership should be banned.\\r\",\"title\":\"Brazil\u2019s New Leader Wants to Ease Gun Laws.

He\u2019d crumple a sheet, uncrumple it, stare into its depths, and think, \u201cThere must be something that would make all this mess look a little less messy.\u201d\\r\\nCrumple, uncrumple, crumple. Sheet after sheet landed in the recycling bin, each one blank but for its chaotically creased geography. In time, a semblance of order emerged.\\r\\nCrumpled wads of paper are no doubt as old and commonplace as paper itself \u2014 \u201cgraves for failed theories,\u201d Mr. Gottesman, a physicist, has called them. But for him, the crumpled paper itself was the research.\\r\\nThe dynamics of crumpling are in play everywhere: in the initial unfolding of an insect\u2019s wing; in the way DNA packs into a cell nucleus, in the challenge of how best to cram a giant solar sail into a small satellite so that it unfurls successfully. Scientists, in turn, devote considerable energy to deciphering, and trying to reduce, this complexity and disorder. Paper is an ideal model.\\r\\n\u201cDespite the apparent ease with which sheets of paper are crumpled and tossed away, crumpling dynamics are often considered a paradigm of complexity,\u201d Mr. Gottesman noted in a research paper published earlier this month in the journal Communications Physics. \\r\\n\u201cOne of the key assumptions physicists make is that there are some universal properties that are shared between many disordered complicated systems,\u201d he said recently. \u201cStudying one complicated system could teach us a lot about other systems as well.\u201d\\r\\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\\r\\nAn unfolding history\\r\\nThe British conceptual artist Martin Creed once said, \u201cI feel like you can have a microcosm of the world in a work.\u201d He achieved as much with his 1995 creation, \u201cWork No. 88,\u201d a single piece of A4 paper crumpled into a ball. Within that crinkled sphere \u2014 like a tectonically wonky planet seen from afar \u2014 Creed wrangled complexity and chaos, deformation and disorder.\\r\\nAs did, that same year, two French physicists at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris, Martine Ben Amar and Yves Pomeau, with a three-page journal article, \u201cPapier froiss\u00e9.\u201d In it they introduced the atom of paper crumpling, the d-cone: the tip of the cone that forms when you place a piece of paper over a cup and press into it with a pencil. (A crumpled ball is a collection of d-cones connected by ridges.)\\r\\n\u201cPapier froiss\u00e9\u201d was followed by a 26-page English version, \u201cCrumpled paper.\u201d The authors concluded by wondering if the same topological ideas about curvature might apply to general relativity.\\r\\nSo began an early chapter in the physics and mathematics of crumpled paper. And now the latest advancement arrives with Mr. Gottesman\u2019s recent contribution, \u201cA state variable for crumpled thin sheets,\u201d which proposed that crumpling dynamics may not be hopelessly complex after all.\\r\\n\u201cThe surprising thing about the result is that it\u2019s very, very simple,\u201d said Shmuel M. Rubinstein, a physicist and the study\u2019s principal investigator, although he emphasized that Mr. Gottesman did most of the work. \u201cWhat Omer showed is that perhaps the most important aspect of a phenomenon that\u2019s considered to be really chaotic \u2014 a paradigm of disorder and complexity and uncertainty, like the butterfly-flapping-its-wings metaphor \u2014 is remarkably predictable, deterministic and simple.\u201d\\r\\nHow to \u2018kvetch\u2019 paper\\r\\nThe methodology was straightforward, anyway. In the lab, Mr. Gottesman crushed hundreds of sheets of paper in a cylindrical container. This was scientific paper, elastoplastic Mylar sheets, which were less likely to inflict paper cuts, or to wilt into a tissue when subjected to repeated crumpling.\\r\\nSome early trial runs, posted on his website as \u201cfun paper stuff,\u201d involved \u201ckvetching\u201d a vertical tube of paper with an empty coffee can. (\u201cKvetch,\u201d a Yiddish word that usually means \u201ccomplain\u201d but translates literally as \u201csqueeze\u201d or \u201cpress,\u201d became a term of endearment around the lab, as stacks of paper complained about their fate.)\\r\\nLike a palm reader intuiting a life line, Mr. Gottesman analyzed the creases of the crumpled paper and sought to tease out a variable, an equation, a law \u2014 something that predicted what would occur with the next crumple.\\r\\nHe toyed with a number of variables: the range of individual crease lengths; the distances between creases; the largest patch without creases; the sharpness of creases, and the amount of energy needed to cause crumpling.\\r\\nFrom one crumple to the next, he observed that a piece of paper never stopped forming new creases, although the rate of their formation slowed logarithmically. With each new crumple, the paper creased along some of its existing scars, but there always came a point when new creases were needed for crumpling to continue.\\r\\n\u201cIn the lab, I crumpled as many as 70 times,\u201d Mr. Gottesman said. \u201cUsually after four or five times you can\u2019t really easily see a difference between one crumple to the next.\u201d\\r\\nHe did, however, notice a trend involving the cumulative total length of all creases on a sheet after each crumple. In the lab, this variable was called \u201cthe mileage.\u201d\\r\\nAs Mr. Gottesman crumpled, he scanned each sheet into his computer, and then, with an algorithm, he measured the sum total of all the creases. He found that if he crumpled two separate sheets, each sheet would, as expected, accumulate damage in a unique way. But the total crease lengths of the two sheets stayed remarkably similar. Length seemed to be a deterministic variable, a so-called state variable, predicting how the network of creases would evolve.\\r\\n\u201cThe detailed history of the crumpling dynamics is written into the intricate pattern of creases,\u201d Mr. Gottesman and his co-authors wrote. \u201cNo two crumpled sheets are identical.\u201d\\r\\nAnd yet the paper is effectively devoid of memory. At each state of crumple, the intricate crease patterns, and the events that led to them, are irrelevant. All that is needed to predict the paper\u2019s next state is the total length of creases in the current one. \u201cYou just care about the current state,\u201d Mr. Gottesman said. \\r\\n\\r\\nA single-state philosophy\\r\\nThe news that crumpled paper obeys a state variable \u2014 or a crease law, or a damage law \u2014 has been received in the academy with wonderment and delight, since, as the authors noted, it represented \u201ca remarkable reduction in complexity.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cThe idea that crumpling can be characterized by as simple a quantity as the length of creases is extremely interesting,\u201d said Dr. Ben Amar. \u201cIt will be marvelous if this experimental work is continued by a theoretical treatment\u201d \u2014 that is, with equations derived from the laws of elasticity.\\r\\nThomas Witten, a physicist at the University of Chicago, found the result striking and puzzling. \u201cIt could prove very exciting,\u201d he said. Witten\u2019s research has shown that every material crumples in roughly the same way \u2014 a tectonic plate, a cell membrane, the graphene in a Buckyball, the fabric of Mona Lisa\u2019s right sleeve as depicted by Leonardo da Vinci, which, for Dr. Witten, folds in a way reminiscent of the human ear.\\r\\nFor Dr. Rubinstein, the damage law is inspiring. It suggests that other complex phenomena might reveal themselves in a comparable way \u2014 \u201csystems that are more mysterious, where you can\u2019t so easily see the scarring and the breakage,\u201d he said. For instance, why do different proteins fold so reliably into similar shapes, and under what conditions do they fail to fold?\\r\\nWith paper, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re doing something very arbitrary. We\u2019re crumpling, flattening, crumpling, flattening. Basically, we are just cycling the system.\u201d Many systems, including the human body, work the same way, he said.\\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at how damage and defects are accumulating, and that is a big question in materials science and in engineering. When will something break? How it will break? These are the most uncertain statistical things in nature. We are helpless against them. But at least for the crumpled paper, it seems like nature is transcending this uncertainty.\u201d\\r\\nThe demise of paper has been predicted for some time now, but paper, it seems, may not be done with us. Paper defies history, in more ways than one. Its scars and creases may even hold a potential philosophy.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good metaphor,\u201d Dr. Rubinstein said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s really hard to imagine that the future depends only on the current situation. We are such a strong function of our history \u2014 personal history, global history, whatnot. It is really counterintuitive to say, Well, our future really only depends on our current state of mind, and not how it developed, how we got to this point.\\r\\n\u201cWe have the same intuition for any complex system: that its evolution is something very strongly dependent on many points in time, many degrees of freedom, and you have to know so many of them. Finding out that you don\u2019t is a pretty big deal.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1443226702,\"description\":\"In a ball of paper, scientists discover a landscape of surprising mathematical order.\\r\",\"title\":\"This Is the Way the Paper Crumples\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.45.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"CAIRO \u2014 The Egyptian authorities have arrested a 19-year-old British tourist over a video he filmed on his cellphone that showed a military helicopter in the background, his family said.\\r\\nThe teenager, Muhammed Fathi Abulkasem, who is Libyan and British, was arrested shortly after he arrived in the Egyptian coastal city of Alexandria on Nov. 21 from neighboring Libya, his cousin Shareen Nawaz said on Friday.\\r\\nEgypt\u2019s Foreign Ministry could not immediately be reached for comment.

He has also realigned Argentina\u2019s foreign policy by cultivating closer ties with the Trump administration.\\r\\nAnd he has pushed to position Argentina as a prominent actor in global debates on issues like climate change, migration and trade policy.\\r\\n\u201cWe went from being a country that was on the global sidelines\u201d to having the responsibility of planning the G-20, Mr. Macri said last year. \u201cWe have to take advantage to make sure the world sees all our potential, live and in person.\u201d\\r\\nInstead, leaders from the world\u2019s largest economies will arrive to a country that is facing many difficulties, particularly with its economy, that have contributed to a plunge in Mr. Macri\u2019s approval ratings.\\r\\nAs the Argentine currency devalued precipitously earlier this year, Mr. Macri took the politically painful step of turning to the International Monetary Fund for a loan. Then, just months later, that loan had to be expanded.\\r\\nStill, without much good news to show, Argentine officials are going to great lengths to pull out an orderly summit meeting.\\r\\nThe government is deploying 22,000 security forces and closing off large sections of the capital to protect the visiting heads of state and their delegations. The city of Buenos Aires declared Friday a holiday to ease traffic and encourage people to leave town.\\r\\nOfficials are mindful of the riots that marred the G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, last year. Critics of globalization of capitalism burned cars, looted businesses and clashed with the police in confrontations that left hundreds injured and led to the arrest or detention of more than 400 people.\\r\\nThis year\u2019s meeting comes at a period of considerable social unrest in Buenos Aires, where protests and street blockades have become a near daily occurrence. And December has historically been a month when these types of demonstrations turn violent, particularly at times of economic upheaval.\\r\\nThe suggestion that residents of the capital leave town during the event was met with outrage by Argentines, who have been struggling to make ends meet amid soaring inflation.\\r\\n\u201cI barely have enough money for food and she wants me to leave the city?\u201d said Paula Valladares, 46, a caregiver to the elderly. \u201cI need to work. If I don\u2019t work, I don\u2019t eat.\u201d\\r\\nAnyone who tried to get an early start to the recommendation faced some trouble on Monday as all flights by the state-owned airline Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas were canceled because of a workers\u2019 strike.\\r\\nEarly Tuesday morning, all public transport came to a halt for three hours in another strike.\\r\\nEven before this weekend\u2019s attack on a bus transporting Boca Junior soccer players to a stadium \u2014 in which several players were injured, leading to the postponement of a long-awaited match that will now take place outside the country \u2014 the city was already on edge after bomb threats led to the evacuation of the American Embassy, the regional airport, the Senate, a bank and a hospital.\\r\\nThose all proved to be false alarms.\\r\\nBut earlier in the month, a group of vegan anarchists were accused of leaving an explosive device in Recoleta Cemetery, the place of rest of several important figures in Argentine history, including the former first lady Eva Duarte de Per\u00f3n.\\r\\nOne of the people implicated in the plot was injured after the device apparently detonated prematurely.\\r\\nThe government also blamed an anarchist group for a homemade bomb that was thrown at a judge\u2019s home.\\r\\nAnother unusual episode that made headlines was the arrest in mid-November of two Argentine citizens accused of having links to Hezbollah. Their family vehemently denied that the two men, ages 23 and 25, were terrorists.\\r\\nThe Center for Legal and Social Studies, a human rights group in Argentina, charges that the country\u2019s government has used the G-20 as an \u201cexcuse to further harden its speech against social protest and street demonstrations and exaggerate its war against terrorism.\u201d\\r\\nOrganizations planning the main anti-G-20 protest, taking place on Friday, say they are sure the city lockdown will affect participation. But they still expect a large turnout for a march that will end in Congress \u2014 about three miles from where the world\u2019s most powerful leaders will be gathered.\\r\\nSome in the city can\u2019t wait for the whole thing to be over and done with.\\r\\n\u201cWe have such a huge country, why did they have to come here?\u201d wondered Esteban Torres, a 31-year-old retail worker. \u201cAs if life in this city weren\u2019t difficult enough.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-880958763,\"description\":\"Soccer fan violence, a recession, strikes and a suspected bombing plot by vegans have rattled Argentina as it prepares to play host to world leaders.\\r\",\"title\":\"Argentina Saw G-20 Summit as a Chance to Shine.

Can a Nice Doctor Make Treatments More Effective?\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"Connecting with patients doesn\u2019t just make them think someone cares. It can make a difference for health outcomes.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>In the age of the internet, it\u2019s easier than ever to pull together lots of information to find the best doctor. And if you\u2019re like most patients, the metric you probably rely on most is the doctor\u2019s credentials. Where did she go to school? How many patients has he treated with this condition?\\r\\n<br>You might also read some Yelp reviews about how nice this doctor is; how friendly and how caring. But all that probably seems secondary to the doctor\u2019s skills; sure, it would be great to have a doctor whom you actually like, but that\u2019s not going to influence your health the way the doctor\u2019s competence will.\\r\\n<br>But our research in the psychology department at Stanford University suggests that this view is mistaken. We found that having a doctor who is warm and reassuring actually improves your health.\\r\\n<br>The simple things a doctor says and does to connect with patients can make a difference for health outcomes.\\r\\n<p>Even a brief reassurance to a patient from a doctor might relieve the patient\u2019s symptoms faster. In a recent study that one of us conducted, our research group recruited 76 participants to receive a skin prick test, a common procedure used in assessing allergies. The provider in this study pricked participants\u2019 forearms with histamine, which makes skin itchy and red.\\r\\n<br>Then, the doctor examined the allergic reactions. For some patients, the doctor examined them without saying much. But for other patients, the doctor had some words of encouragement. He told them: \u201cFrom this point forward, your allergic reaction will start to diminish, and your rash and irritation will go away.\u201d It turns out that this one sentence of assurance from a provider led patients to report that their reactions were less itchy \u2014 even though the doctor didn\u2019t give any medication or treatment along with his words. Words alone from the provider relieved patients\u2019 symptoms.\\r\\n<br>This tells us that a physician\u2019s words might be more powerful than we normally realize. And research shows that it is not only when patients are taking placebos that demeanor matters. In fact, provider words influence the efficacy of even our most powerful drugs and treatments.\\r\\n<br>But as anyone who has been on the receiving end of a terse \u201cYou\u2019re fine\u201d knows, it\u2019s not just what you say, it\u2019s how you say it. \\r\\n<br>In another study one of us worked on, we assessed whether the same words from a doctor influence patients differently depending on how warm or competent the doctor seemed. Again, patients received a histamine skin prick. Depending on what experimental group they were assigned to, patients met a provider trained to act in one of two very different ways. One group met the provider many of us dream of: she acted both warm and competent, calling patients by name, smiling, chatting and making eye contact. Her office was spotless, she spoke clearly and confidently, and she pulled off the medical procedures without a hitch.\\r\\n<p>The other group, however, met the kind of doctor all too many of us have encountered: glued to the computer screen throughout the exam, the provider didn\u2019t bother introducing herself and asked questions only to gather practical information. She also stumbled through some of the procedures in the messy exam room and sounded rather unsure of herself.\\r\\n<br>In both groups, the provider gave patients a cream that she said was an antihistamine to reduce the allergic reaction and decrease itching. The cream was merely unscented hand lotion: a placebo. (A benefit of doing this research in the lab is that for the purposes of the study, we can temporarily lead patients to believe something that is untrue, something doctors could never do in a real clinic visit.)\\r\\n<br>Decades of robust literature on placebo effects demonstrate that, even without any active ingredients, this cream should reduce the allergic reaction. But no one had examined how the doctor\u2019s demeanor might influence the effects of a placebo treatment.\\r\\n<br>Our study revealed that the placebo cream reduced participants\u2019 allergic reactions only when the provider projected warmth and competence. When the provider acted colder and less competent, the placebo cream had no effect. It seems that it\u2019s not just what the doctor says about a treatment that matters. It matters how the doctor who says it engages with patients. Doctors who are warmer and more competent are able to set more powerful expectations about medical treatments. Those positive expectations, in turn, have a measurable impact on health.\\r\\n<br>So, we saw that when the provider projected both desirable qualities of warmth and competence, her words had an effect. When she projected neither, they did not.\\r\\n<br>What about a provider who seems competent, but not warm? One other group of patients met a provider who seemed highly competent but remained businesslike and distant throughout the interaction, and they did not respond to the placebo cream as much as when the provider acted warm and competent.\\r\\n<br>Patients of even the most accomplished and skillful doctors may benefit more when that doctor also connects with them.\\r\\n<p>All of this research suggests that doctors who don\u2019t connect with their patients may risk undermining a treatment\u2019s success. Doctor-patient rapport is not just a fluffy, feel-good bonus that boosts Yelp reviews, but a component of medical care that has important effects on a patient\u2019s physical health. Particularly as artificial intelligence promises a world where we don\u2019t need to go to the doctor for minor questions, we should not overlook the value of interacting with a human doctor and hearing words of encouragement.\\r\\n<br>And while physicians may worry that building rapport with patients requires too much time in a health care setting with visits that are already too short, there are simple ways to build warmth and competence \u2014 such as smiling, looking patients in the eye and asking their names \u2014 that don\u2019t tax doctors beyond their limits.\\r\\n<br>We often think the only parts of medical care that really matter are the \u201cactive\u201d ingredients of medicine: the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. But focusing only on these ingredients leaves important components of care underappreciated and underutilized. To really help people flourish, health care works better when it includes caring.\\r\\n<br>Lauren Howe and Kari Leibowitz are social psychologists at Stanford University.\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"health.9.txt\",\"id\":744716624},{\"title\":\"These Days, \u2018You Practically Need a Ph.D.\u2019 to Figure Out Frequent-Flier Status\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"Airlines\u2019 most valuable customers \u2014 the ones who fly and spend the most \u2014 get lots of perks. For everyone else, it has become more complicated to qualify.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>The airlines\u2019 most valuable customers, those who fly most often and spend the most money, receive the sorts of benefits that most travelers can only salivate over \u2014 lounge access, free checked luggage, free upgrades, free itinerary changes.\\r\\n<br>But most travelers aren\u2019t constantly flying, and they will find that the airlines have made it a lot more complicated to qualify even for a piece of that good life. \u201cYou practically need a Ph.D.\u201d to understand and compare all the complex rules among the different airlines, said Jamie Larounis of the travel blog The Forward Cabin.\\r\\n<br>Three of the major airlines in the United States, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, each have four frequent-flier status levels and different formulas to compute the tiers. Alaska Airlines has three tiers and Southwest Airlines two; JetBlue has one. In the past few years most airlines have added spending requirements to their frequent-flier programs.\\r\\n<br>Customers seeking elite status first need to understand that not all miles flown and dollars spent are equal. There are \u201cqualifying\u201d miles and dollars (sometimes called elite qualifying, medallion qualifying or premier qualifying). Those count toward achieving status with the airline. Other miles and dollars can be redeemed for flights or other items but do not help the flier get the top benefits. To figure out which miles and dollars qualify for status, travelers often have to read the fine print on airline websites.\\r\\n<p>A flier who has attained MVP status \u2014 the lowest frequent-flier status \u2014 on Alaska earns, for example, 50 percent bonus miles on flights they take. Those miles can be used only to redeem tickets or other items; they do not count toward achieving next year\u2019s MVP status. The same fliers earn bonus miles if their ticket is booked in one of six of the 15 fare classes that grant bonuses. These miles do qualify toward elite status.\\r\\n<br>Then, there are the flights on the airlines\u2019 partner carriers. Flights on partner airlines offer miles, but fliers may need more of them to achieve status. The Alaska flier needs to fly 20,000 miles on Alaska to achieve MVP status, but 25,000 miles if some miles were earned on partner airlines. Alaska Airlines offered a post on its website this month with tips for fliers hoping to earn status.\\r\\n<br>Alaska does not require spending minimums, but for those airlines that do, money spent on a plane ticket will usually go toward elite status; spending on things other than flights using an airline credit card will usually not qualify. Flights booked with a partner airline may earn qualifying miles but not dollars, or follow some kind of percentage formula for credit.\\r\\n<br>There are quirks throughout the complex system. For example, the lowest-fare ticket class, Basic Economy, may be counted as only half the miles flown or half a segment flown. Spending on airline credit cards may not generally count toward elite status spending requirements, but a customer may be granted a waiver if a certain high spending threshold is reached. Each airline has its own set of rules and formulas, and all make changes from time to time.\\r\\n<br>And some airlines will try to attract valuable passengers away from competitors by offering to match the passenger\u2019s elite flying status with their own. The flier must then meet the flying and spending requirements of the new airline within a certain period to maintain that status.\\r\\n<p>It all adds up to a daunting set of rules for frequent-flier programs. As Gary Leff, creator of the travel blog View From the Wing, put it, airline customers need to believe that it\u2019s worth spending the time to wade through the rules and plan their travel in a way that benefits them.\\r\\n<br>Travelers should keep in mind, Mr. Leff said, that the airline programs have become less rewarding. Tickets cost more to redeem, and because flights are fuller, they are harder to redeem, he said.\\r\\n<br>The airlines do not release figures on the number of frequent fliers. But Mr. Leff said he believed that the number of elite status fliers had actually increased from a decade ago. That\u2019s because more people are flying more miles now, he said, and because airline mergers have made it easier to concentrate trips on one brand.\\r\\n<br>Those who attain elite status can get hooked on the benefits. Andrea Umbach, an executive coach in Seattle, found that her Alaska status meant she could change or cancel an Alaska ticket without a fee.\\r\\n<br>\u201cI could book a trip to a client meeting or conference far enough in advance to get a good price, but could change it without spending a lot if my plans changed,\u201d she said. That helps her manage her business expenses.\\r\\n<br>Ms. Umbach is spending January looking at her plans for travel this year with an eye on retaining her MVP Gold frequent-flier status \u2014 the second level of status. She plans to check in on her progress periodically and make extra flights at the end of the year if she needs to.\\r\\n<br>For those who like to plan ahead, January is a good time to read airline and credit card website details and think about the next 12 months of travel, Mr. Leff said. Travelers should look at airlines\u2019 schedules and destinations, and the benefits offered at each elite flier level. Then, he said, they should approximate the travel they will do and see what status levels they can achieve.\\r\\n<p>If a traveler wants to take a long flight, mainly just to earn miles, Mr. Larounis suggests taking those \u201cmileage runs\u201d early in the year. There are lots of great deals on long flights in January and February after the holiday rush, he said, and padding the mileage account early in the year reduces the stress of putting together last-minute trips later when prices may be higher.\\r\\n<br>Gaining status early in the year also gives the flier more time to enjoy the benefits. On Southwest Airlines, for example, fliers who cross the 25-flight or 35,000-point threshold requirements receive \u201cA-List\u201d benefits immediately, and those benefits extend through the calendar year in which the status is earned as well as the next calendar year.\\r\\n<br>Some airlines give customers who are close to a cutoff at the end of a calendar year the chance to buy their way into a status level. Paying can be an expensive way to go, Mr. Leff said, but can be less of a hassle than taking an extra flight just to rack up miles.\\r\\n<br>On Delta Air Lines, miles earned above a \u201cmedallion tier\u201d threshold are rolled over to give fliers a jump start on next year\u2019s totals. If, for instance, a passenger has flown 30,000 medallion qualifying miles with Delta at the end of the year, that is enough to qualify for the 25,000-mile platinum status, and the extra 5,000 miles will be rolled into next year\u2019s total.\\r\\n<br>Ms. Umbach said she mainly kept up her elite status for business reasons, but the little touches mattered, too. She said she flew from Seattle to Boise, Idaho, about once a month to help take care of her parents, and the airplane she takes is small without much food or beverage service.\\r\\n<br>\u201cA flight attendant always comes to my seat to thank me for me being a Gold flier and gives me a chocolate bar,\u201d she said.\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"business.7.txt\",\"id\":-771583032},{\"title\":\"D.N.C.

There is no evidence that the most recent attack was successful.\\r\\n<br>The documents, filed in federal court in New York, were part of an amended complaint in a lawsuit filed in April that claimed the committee was the victim of a conspiracy by Russian intelligence agents, President Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and WikiLeaks to damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential run.\\r\\n<br>The new court filings say the time stamps and contents of the spearphishing emails received in November were consistent with separate cyberattacks around the same time tied to the Russian hacking group known as Cozy Bear, one of the two Russian groups suspected of breaching D.N.C. computers in 2016.\\r\\n<p>Security researchers believe the hacking attempt against the D.N.C. in November was part of a broader campaign that used decoy emails that appeared to come from the State Department.\\r\\n<br>That campaign had more than a dozen targets, including government agencies, think tanks, law enforcement officials, journalists, military personnel, defense contractors, pharmaceutical companies and transportation officials, according to a report by the cybersecurity firm FireEye. Researchers believe the goal was to ferret out American foreign policy, particularly related to Africa; Democratic policy positions; and the platforms of 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls.\\r\\n<br>FireEye said the attempted hacking of the D.N.C. in November resembled other recent attacks attributed to Cozy Bear, including in its \u201cdeliberate reuse\u201d of old phishing tactics and reliance on a similar list of victims. But there were a few new wrinkles, including new decoy email addresses and different obfuscation techniques.\\r\\n<br>The hackers sent some targets of the broader campaign three phishing emails at most. In other instances, they were more aggressive, sending as many as 136 emails to a single organization. In some cases, the malware-laced emails were successful. And once they gained access to a computer network, it was only a matter of hours before they were deploying stealthier hacking tools.\\r\\n<br>The attackers in November compromised a hospital email server to launch their phishing emails, a common tactic of the Cozy Bear group, said Nick Carr, a senior manager at FireEye.\\r\\n<p>Cozy Bear hackers are skilled at rummaging through a network without drawing attention, said Matthew Dunwoody, a FireEye security researcher. Once in, they often swap out their phishing tools for malware that can be hard to detect, he said.\\r\\n<br>FireEye said that although Cozy Bear was the likeliest culprit, the firm could not firmly establish who was responsible for the 2018 campaign against the D.N.C. and other targets. CrowdStrike, another cybersecurity firm, also noted an uptick in hacking activity in November, but it could not say definitively that Cozy Bear was to blame.\\r\\n<br>Cozy Bear, also known by security firms as APT 29 or the Dukes, was one of two Russian groups involved in the 2016 hacking of the D.N.C. It has not attracted the same scrutiny as the other group, Fancy Bear, or APT 28, which has been linked to a string of cyberattacks against the D.N.C., the International Olympic Committee and other international organizations.\\r\\n<br>Cozy Bear has been active since 2016, security researchers say, and has been linked to a coordinated wave of hacking attacks on Democratic Party officials.\\r\\n<br>The D.N.C. says in the amended complaint that the November campaign was consistent with a continuing push by Russian hackers to target Democratic candidates and party leaders. In 2017, Russian hackers are believed to have attempted a hack of the computer network of former Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri and the networks of at least two other candidates in the midterm elections.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Trump has long denied any collusion with Russia, and in December several defendants named in the D.N.C.\u2019s lawsuit argued that it should be dismissed because the committee was using it to try to \u201cexplain away\u201d the Democratic \u201ccandidate\u2019s defeat in the 2016 presidential campaign.\u201d\\r\\n<br>On Friday, Geoffrey A.

In a \u201cstatement of immunity\u201d from Russia\u2019s Ministry of Justice, Russian authorities argued that even if it were responsible for the hacking, such a \u201csovereign act\u201d would be considered a \u201cmilitary action\u201d protected by a 1976 law that offers some immunity from lawsuits regarding foreign governments\u2019 actions in the United States.\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"technology.14.txt\",\"id\":-753305417},{\"title\":\"Trump Proposals Could Increase Health Costs for Consumers\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"President Trump says he wants to reduce drug prices, but some patients could face higher out-of-pocket costs for medicines and other goods and services.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>WASHINGTON \u2014 Consumers who use expensive brand-name prescription drugs when cheaper alternatives are available could face higher costs under a new policy being proposed by the Trump administration.\\r\\n<br>The proposal, to be published this week in the Federal Register, would apply to health insurance plans sold under the Affordable Care Act.\\r\\n<br>Health plans have annual limits on consumers\u2019 out-of-pocket costs. Under the proposal, insurers would not have to count the full amount of a consumer\u2019s co-payment for a brand-name drug toward the annual limit on cost-sharing. Insurers would have to count only the smaller amount that would be charged for a generic version of the drug.\\r\\n<br>For example, if a consumer filled a doctor\u2019s prescription for a brand-name drug with a $25 co-payment, rather than using a generic medicine with a $5 co-payment, the consumer might get credit for only $5 in out-of-pocket spending. Consumers would have to spend more of their own money before reaching the annual limit on out-of-pocket costs.\\r\\n<p>In addition, insurers would not have to count the value of coupons and other financial assistance provided to consumers by drug manufacturers if generic alternatives were available. This change could significantly increase consumers\u2019 out-of-pocket costs for some of the more expensive prescription drugs and has prompted protests from groups representing patients.\\r\\n<br>President Trump has repeatedly vowed to reduce drug prices and to lower out-of-pocket drug costs. But for some consumers, the latest proposal could have the opposite effect.\\r\\n<br>The proposal highlights a potential conflict between patients with a particular disease, who may benefit from the use of coupons, and other consumers more generally. Economists say that coupons can raise health care costs by encouraging people to use more expensive drugs.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThe availability of a coupon may cause physicians and beneficiaries to choose an expensive brand-name drug when a less expensive and equally effective generic or other alternative is available,\u201d the Trump administration said in explaining its proposal. \u201cWhen consumers are relieved of co-payment obligations, manufacturers are relieved of a market constraint on drug prices.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Moreover, it said, \u201ccoupons can add significant long-term costs to the health care system that may outweigh the short-term benefits.\u201d\\r\\n<p>But Bari Talente, an executive vice president of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, said, \u201cMany people with M.S. rely on co-pay assistance, even for generic medications.\u201d\\r\\n<br>In the last few years, she said, generic versions of the drug Copaxone have become available, but even they have high prices. One of the generic medicines costs $60,000 to $65,000 a year, she said.\\r\\n<br>Carl E. Schmid II, the deputy executive director of the AIDS Institute, a public policy and advocacy organization, said the administration\u2019s proposal could sharply increase out-of-pocket costs, so that a consumer who now pays virtually nothing might have to pay $3,500 a year or more for a drug to treat H.I.V.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThat increases the likelihood that people won\u2019t pick up their drugs, won\u2019t take their drugs,\u201d Mr. Schmid said.\\r\\n<br>Leyla Mansour-Cole, the policy director of the Diabetes Patient Advocacy Coalition, a nonprofit group, said the Trump administration proposal \u201ccaused trepidation\u201d for some patients.\\r\\n<br>\u201cIn theory, co-pay coupons could encourage people to take higher-priced drugs,\u201d Ms. Mansour-Cole said. \u201cIn reality, people use them to get the medicines that their doctors prescribe, despite astronomically high deductibles.\u201d\\r\\n<br>The administration is proposing several other changes that could increase costs for consumers.\\r\\n<br>Under the proposal, fewer people would qualify for federal subsidies, and those who qualify could be required to spend a larger share of their income on insurance premiums.\\r\\n<p>In addition, the proposal could lead to a small increase in out-of-pocket costs, which include co-payments and deductibles for doctors\u2019 services and hospital care.\\r\\n<br>The changes would result from a new method of calculating inflation in health insurance prices \u2014 a factor used in computing the amount of premium subsidies and the annual limit on consumers\u2019 out-of-pocket costs.\\r\\n<br>The Trump administration estimated that the changes would save the government $900 million annually in subsidies in 2020 and 2021 and $1 billion a year in 2022 and 2023. In addition, it predicted that 100,000 fewer people would have coverage through the insurance exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act.\\r\\n<br>The administration said that some of the 100,000 people might buy short-term insurance policies, which do not have to cover pre-existing conditions or provide all the benefits required by the health law. But, it said, most are \u201clikely to become uninsured.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Either way, the administration said, \u201cthese individuals will be bearing a larger share of the costs of their own health care consumption.\u201d\\r\\n<br>The proposed rule may reduce federal spending and the need to collect taxes in the future, the administration said. \u201cHowever,\u201d it added, \u201cthe increased number of uninsured may increase federal and state uncompensated care costs.\u201d\\r\\n<br>The administration estimated that premiums \u2014 after subsidies, in the form of tax credits \u2014 would be 1 percent higher as a result of its proposal.\\r\\n<p>The limit on out-of-pocket costs is already high; a consumer can be required to spend as much as $7,900 a year. Under the formula now in use, the limit would rise to $8,000 next year. Under the Trump administration proposal, it would increase to $8,200.\\r\\n<br>Administration officials said their proposal would more accurately measure insurance price inflation. But Democrats refused to accept that explanation, noting that Mr. Trump had tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act during his entire first year in office.\\r\\n<br>Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, described the new proposed rule as \u201cTrump\u2019s latest attempt to sabotage health care.\u201d\\r\\n<br>The Trump administration is also proposing a new requirement to increase the number of health insurance plans that omit coverage of abortion services.\\r\\n<br>Under the proposal, insurers that provide coverage of abortions would also have to offer at least one plan providing the same benefits but excluding coverage of abortions.\\r\\n<br>The administration said it was concerned that some people who wanted to buy insurance under the Affordable Care act refrained from doing so because they had religious or moral objections to abortion coverage.

The future of fracking in Britain remains uncertain.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>LONDON \u2014 Last fall an energy company began a hydraulic fracturing operation in northwest England that it hoped would be a milestone in creating a new, domestic source of natural gas for Britain \u2014 in much the same way that fracking has taken hold in the United States.\\r\\n<br>Three months later, after regularly causing earthquakes, the fracking has stopped, and the company has begun pulling some equipment from the site.\\r\\n<br>The company, Cuadrilla Resources, says it will continue to work in the cow pasture near Blackpool in Lancashire, seeking to extract natural gas economically and safely from the shale rocks. But so far, its results have failed to win over skeptics.\\r\\n<br>Some gas has bubbled up through the fracking liquids in its well, demonstrating that the rock formation Cuadrilla was exploring, known as the Bowland Shale, indeed contains some fuel. But the company was forced to suspend fracking at least four times when the work led to earthquakes that exceeded a magnitude of 0.5, the upper limit set by British regulators. There were also many smaller tremors.\\r\\n<p>This stop-and-go added to the company\u2019s costs while doing little in Britain to improve the public image of fracking, which involves injecting special fluids under high pressure to free up gas trapped in shale rock. Cuadrilla is also running behind its original schedule: The company indicated in October that it planned to drill and frack two wells in three months, but has so far fracked just one.\\r\\n<br>\u201cIt\u2019s not gone very well,\u201d said Peter Styles, an emeritus professor of geophysics at Keele University, who has advised the British government and industry on fracking and seismic matters. \u201cThey\u2019ve probably lost the public argument.\u201d\\r\\n<br>With fracking halted, trucks have been taking pumps and other heavy fracking gear off the site, leading to local speculation that Cuadrilla might be throwing in the towel, something that the company denies.\\r\\n<p>Cuadrilla said in an email that it was shifting its focus from fracking to testing how much gas can be coaxed from the well. Such flow rates are important in determining whether shale gas drilling is commercially viable. The company said it was returning equipment that was not needed for this purpose. Cuadrilla is owned by a Wall Street investment firm, Riverstone Holdings, and an Australian drilling services company, AJ Lucas.\\r\\n<br>At the same time, the company has been lobbying the government to lift the limits on earth tremors so it can speed up the fracking process and, possibly, permit more powerful pumping.\\r\\n<p>\u201cWe would like to see our data and experience considered as a starting point to revisit the limits, whilst ensuring public safety and confidence is maintained,\u201d the company said in its email.\\r\\n<br>In October, Francis Egan, Cuadrilla\u2019s chief executive, used stronger language, warning in an interview with The Financial Times that the fracking industry \u201ccould be strangled at birth\u201d unless rules were eased. Frackers in the United States have also encountered earthquake problems, though the thresholds in North America for stopping work are typically greater than magnitude 2.0, wrote F. Todd Davidson, a research associate at the Energy Institute of the University of Texas at Austin, in an email.\\r\\n<br>Other companies pursuing shale in Britain, like Igas Energy and Ineos, a large petrochemical company with shale interests, have also called for a review of the rules.\\r\\n<br>The government has rejected any appeals to loosen its regulations. On Nov. 2, in a letter obtained by Greenpeace, Claire Perry, the minister of state for clean growth and energy, wrote to Mr. Egan that \u201cthe government believes the current system is fit for purpose and has no intention of altering it.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Ms. Perry also noted that Cuadrilla\u2019s fracturing plan was \u201cdeveloped and reviewed over several months with reference to existing regulations\u201d and that \u201cat no point did you communicate that it would not be possible to proceed without a change in regulations.\u201d\\r\\n<br>The tremors have not posed a threat to life or property, according to experts. The British Geological Survey, a research organization that had placed monitors around Cuadrilla\u2019s fracking site, reported that only two of the tremors \u2014 including the largest one, on Dec. 11, which registered magnitude 1.5 \u2014 were felt by residents in the area.\\r\\n<p>\u201cAll of the events have been extremely small,\u201d said Brian Baptie, one of the organization\u2019s seismologists. \u201cThe regulations are doing their job\u201d in preventing earthquakes that might disturb the public, he said.\\r\\n<p>Mr. Baptie said that the British rules had been set at \u201cvery, very conservative\u201d levels. As more data becomes available, he said, there could be \u201cscope\u201d for modifying the thresholds to perhaps a limit of 1.0. He warned, though, that increasing the amounts of liquids injected might also increase the probability of larger seismic events. In western Canada, for instance, fracking was blamed for a substantial 4.8-magnitude earthquake in 2016.\\r\\n<br>Still, the fact that any tremors were recorded may prove a setback for the industry. \u201cIt has demonstrated quite clearly that they cannot undertake the fracking process without causing earthquakes,\u201d said Miranda Cox, a local councilor in Kirkham, which is about three miles from the site, and an opponent of fracking.\\r\\n<br>Studies have shown that Britain has substantial natural gas resources embedded in shale rock, but Cuadrilla\u2019s recent experiment appears to leave both the government and the industry with few attractive options. For the government, fracking offers the potential to enhance Britain\u2019s energy security by providing an alternative to imported fuel, but it will be reluctant to be seen easing regulations in a way that increases risks.\\r\\n<br>For the handful of active shale companies, progress has been slow, stymied by a lengthy regulatory process and opposition from environmentalists and local residents who worry about earthquakes and groundwater pollution. Those living near potential drilling sites also do not want their lives disrupted by the large volumes of truck traffic that drilling and fracking a well require.\\r\\n<br>In Lancashire, a small but determined band of protesters has monitored and occasionally obstructed drilling. According to the Lancashire police, about 100 officers were involved in patrolling the Cuadrilla site from January 2017 through September 2018 with cumulative costs exceeding 9 million pounds.\\r\\n<br>In an interview in October before drilling began, Mr. Egan, Cuadrilla\u2019s chief executive, suggested that the protests and other obstacles might melt away once the industry gained traction.\\r\\n<br>That seems unlikely to happen soon given the recent experience.\\r\\n<br>Richard Taylor, an oil and gas analyst at Fitch Solutions, a market research firm, said the tremors had \u201cdone no favors\u201d for the fledgling industry.\\r\\n<br>\u201cIt reaffirms our long-term view that production from shale gas in the U.K. at a commercial stage is very much a distant prospect,\u201d he said.\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"business.5.txt\",\"id\":1657028483},{\"title\":\"F.T.C.

But on Monday, they acknowledged that many men killed in the attack were militia members they had been training.\\r\\n<br>The intelligence agency was using the center to train and equip pro-government militia members before sending them to other parts of the province to support security forces, said Mr. Hotak, the Wardak provincial council member.\\r\\n<br>Despite the cold winter in most parts of the country and American efforts to persuade the Taliban to sit down for talks with the Afghan government, violence has continued unabated across the country.\\r\\n<br>Zalmay Khalilzad, the American special envoy for facilitating Afghan peace talks, is on the latest of several trips to the region over the past couple of months to build momentum for talks.\\r\\n<br>After visiting Pakistan, where Taliban leaders enjoy sanctuary, Mr. Khalilzad struck an optimistic tone.\\r\\n<br>\u201cWe\u2019re heading in the right direction with more steps by Pakistan coming that will lead to concrete results,\u201d he wrote on his Facebook page Monday.\\r\\n<br>Hours after the attack in Wardak, the Taliban put out a statement saying they had resumed talks, which had seemed stalled for weeks, with American diplomats in Doha, the capital of Qatar.\\r\\n<p>\u201cFollowing American acceptance of the agenda of ending invasion of Afghanistan and preventing Afghanistan from being used against other countries in the future, talks with American representatives took place today in Doha,\u201d the Taliban spokesman said in a statement.\\r\\n<br>Omar Sadr, a researcher at the Afghan Institute for Strategic Studies, said experience from other peace efforts showed that violence often goes up before talks reach an important stage, as all sides try to gain more leverage at the negotiating table.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Sadr said that while large Taliban attacks in the past would draw emotional responses from Afghan leaders who would pull out of talks, the year ahead is likely to be shaped by violence and talks going hand in hand.\\r\\n<br>The talks have been focused between the Taliban and the Americans, and the Afghan government has expressed frustration at feeling marginalized.\\r\\n<br>The Taliban have said they want agreements with the Americans over the future of American troops in the country and the release of Taliban prisoners before they discuss an end state with the Afghans.\\r\\n<br>In December, the Trump administration ordered the military to begin plans to withdraw about 7,000 American troops from Afghanistan in coming months, a move that seemed uncoordinated with the American negotiators and whose timing surprised Western diplomats in Afghanistan. But the drawdown has not yet begun, and Defense Department officials have been unable to clarify how many troops will leave the country or by when.\\r\\n<br>The top American commander in Afghanistan, as well visiting senior American generals, have played down the notion that the withdrawal was imminent.\\r\\n<p>\u201cBoth sides are serious, and there is progress,\u201d Mr. Sadr said about the talks between the Taliban and the Americans. \u201cThe talks have turned into a process, and there is a chain of events.\u201d\\r\\n<br>\u201cBut what could lead to a cease-fire is a certain stability to the progress,\u201d he continued. \u201cBoth sides have demands before that cease-fire, and it looks until then they will try to use military pressure to gain more.\u201d\\r\\n<br>The Taliban launched a similar deadly attack in neighboring Logar Province on Sunday, targeting a convoy of senior officials that included the provincial governor and intelligence chief.\\r\\n<br>Shams Larawai, the spokesman for the governor of Logar, said that both officials had \u201cescaped the attack unharmed,\u201d but that seven police officers and an intelligence officer had been killed and 10 members of the security forces, most of them police officers, had been wounded.\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"world.0.txt\",\"id\":-476441678},{\"title\":\"DealBook Briefing: World Economic Forum Begins With a Warning\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"An influential financier says investors should pay heed to growing social tensions \u2014 and the message is resonating at the gathering in Davos, Switzerland.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>Good Tuesday morning.

Klarman, the billionaire investor who runs the Baupost Group hedge fund, warns that social and political division risks economic calamity:\\r\\n<br>\u201cIt can\u2019t be business as usual amid constant protests, riots, shutdowns and escalating social tensions.\u201d\\r\\n<br>His message is likely to encourage hand-wringing of a sort usually seen in Davos, Andrew writes.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Klarman says mounting debt in developed countries since the 2008 financial crisis could lead to a financial panic. He is especially worried about the debt load in the United States:\\r\\n<br>\u201cThere is no way to know how much debt is too much, but America will inevitably reach an inflection point whereupon a suddenly more skeptical debt market will refuse to continue to lend to us at rates we can afford. By the time such a crisis hits, it will likely be too late to get our house in order.\u201d\\r\\n<br>More from Davos: Political turmoil has led several world leaders to skip the gathering.

The slowdown intensified in the last three months of 2018, and the official jobless rate increased to 4.9 percent last month from 4.8 percent in November.\\r\\n<p>Economists tend to be skeptical about official data from Beijing, but there\u2019s been an onslaught of evidence recently for weakness in the Chinese economy, brought on by crushing debt, a bitter trade fight with the U.S. and evolving business norms.\\r\\n<br>Factory jobs are no longer desirable, leading manufacturers to try automation, according to the NYT. Ford Motor assembly plants in Chongqing are slowing production. Chinese exporters have delayed hiring plans.\\r\\n<br>And China\u2019s securities industry last year suffered its first annual decline in head count since 2014. Bonuses are likely to shrink, too.\\r\\n<br>Officials around the world are sounding the alarm:\\r\\n<br>\u2022 Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the European Union\u2019s commissioner for trade, said that European investment in China was declining, because doing business there was \u201cbecoming increasingly complicated.\u201d\\r\\n<br>\u2022 Heng Swee Keat, the finance minister of Singapore, a nation heavily reliant on international trade, said at the World Economic Forum that trade friction between China and the U.S. could have a \u201cvery negative\u201d effect on the global economy.\\r\\n<p>\u2022 President Xi Jinping of China said on Monday that his Communist Party faced \u201csharp and serious dangers\u201d:\\r\\n<br>The party is facing long-term and complex tests in terms of maintaining long-term rule, reform and opening-up, a market-driven economy, and within the external environment.\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<h2>I.M.F. expects a \u2018serious slowdown\u2019\\r\\n<br>The International Monetary Fund brought a chill to this week\u2019s down-jacketed procession of world leaders, cutting its global economic growth forecasts.\\r\\n<br>The fund expects weakness in Europe, a slowdown in China, a possible no-deal Brexit and trade spats sustained by the U.S. to lead to 3.5 percent growth in 2019 and 3.6 percent growth in 2020, down from October\u2019s forecasts.\\r\\n<br>\u201cRisks are rising\u201d after two years of \u201csolid expansion,\u201d said Christine Lagarde, its managing director. She added:\\r\\n<br>\u201cDoes that mean a global recession is around the corner? No. But the risk of a sharper decline in global growth has certainly increased.\u201d\\r\\n<br>More on the global outlook:\\r\\n<br>\u2022 The I.M.F. got a new chief economist this month: Gita Gopinath of Harvard, the first woman in the role. She issued warnings at Davos about China and Brexit.\\r\\n<br>\u2022 Central banks are grappling with how to use verbal cues and other hints to signal their plans as conditions get tougher.\\r\\n<br>\u2022 Some 30 percent of business leaders expect global expansion to slow \u2014 six times the number who felt that way a year ago, according to a survey from PricewaterhouseCoopers. It found 37 percent of North American executives optimistic, down from 63 percent last year.\\r\\n<br>\u2022 But in what Matt Phillips called \u201ca remarkable turnaround,\u201d stocks have surged in the first few weeks of the year after a substantial plunge at the end of 2018. Buoyed by assurances from the Federal Reserve, it is the market\u2019s best start to a year since 1987.\\r\\n<h2>Shutdown Day 32: Rejected proposals and old habits\\r\\n<br>As a flash freeze arrived in the Midwest and the Northeast, the shutdown continued to weigh on the homeless, the elderly, veterans, low-income renters and many others.\\r\\n<p>Democrats, who have refused to negotiate until the government is reopened, rejected a proposal from President Trump on Saturday to exchange temporary protections for some immigrants for $5.7 billion for a border wall. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, called it \u201chostage taking.\u201d\\r\\n<br>In response, Mr. Trump complained that Speaker Nancy Pelosi has behaved \u201cirrationally,\u201d and then took a shot at San Francisco, which she represents. The bulk of Republican senators have fallen in line behind his proposal, and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, is said to be incorporating the terms into a broader package.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior feels familiar, write Russ Beuttner and Maggie Haberman:\\r\\n<br>As he did during decades in business, Mr. Trump has insulted adversaries, undermined his aides, repeatedly changed course, extolled his primacy as a negotiator and induced chaos.\\r\\n<br>More shutdown news:\\r\\n<br>\u2022 Companies unable to finalize approval for initial public offerings are trying to move ahead with workarounds.\\r\\n<br>\u2022 Hours before the shutdown began, Mr. Trump signed a bipartisan criminal justice bill. Implementation is likely to be delayed.\\r\\n<br>\u2022 The stock market is one of Mr. Trump\u2019s favorite indicators of his administration\u2019s success. But at times, the going\u2019s been bumpy.\\r\\n<h2>Brinkmanship over Brexit\\r\\n<br>After her Brexit plan was defeated, Prime Minister Theresa May returned to Parliament yesterday with a Plan B. It looked a lot like Plan A, writes Stephen Castle, setting the stage for another battle with rebellious lawmakers.\\r\\n<br>The proposal: Mrs. May promised to negotiate changes that many regard as cosmetic.\\r\\n<br>The strategy: She appeared to double down on her gamble that lawmakers will eventually hold their noses and vote for her plan, rather than risk a no-deal Brexit or no Brexit at all.\\r\\n<p>The response: Frustration. The process is more or less where it has been for months, with Mrs. May locked in a game of brinkmanship as the clock ticks down.\\r\\n<br>More Brexit news: Britain\u2019s main opposition party is backing a proposal that could open the door to a second referendum. The European Union is increasing its efforts to avoid market chaos if there\u2019s no deal. Companies buying British assets are having to find financing in euros or dollars, if they can find it at all. Two trading platforms are moving out of London. There\u2019s been violence in Northern Ireland. Britain\u2019s statistics agency could find no evidence for a claim that Brexit is making food companies shrink their products.

Mr. Duterte has repeatedly criticized the current law as tying the hands of law enforcement against underage offenders working for drug gangs. The measure still awaits approval by the full House.\\r\\n<br>Rights groups say Mr. Duterte\u2019s antidrug campaign has been a human rights disaster for the Philippines, with thousands of drug dealers, users and others killed since he came to power in 2016.\\r\\n<br>Romeo Dongeto, head of the Philippine advocacy group Child Rights Network, said advocates around the world were \u201cshocked and disappointed\u201d by the proposed law, which he called a \u201cstark mockery of the field of child development.\u201d\\r\\n<p>Mr. Duterte\u2019s allies control both houses of Congress, and the Senate is likely to pass its own version of the bill. Once that happens, \u201cthere will surely be grave repercussions for Filipino children,\u201d Mr. Dongeto said in an interview.\\r\\n<br>\u201cChildren may not only be arrested on the spot, but also risk being detained in crowded adult detention centers, even if the bill points to separate child-caring institutions to take them in,\u201d he said.\\r\\n<br>Philippine jails have become increasingly packed under Mr. Duterte\u2019s antidrug campaign, ranking among the most overcrowded in the world. While the current juvenile justice law mandates that each of the country\u2019s 81 provinces and 33 highly urbanized cities establish centers for underage offenders, the cash-strapped government has set up only about 50, Mr. Dongeto said.\\r\\n<br>He argued that young offenders often face a more difficult future and have trouble adjusting to the real world, and that lowering the age of criminal liability would only make that worse. Facing a criminal case and going to trial at such a young age \u201cis traumatizing and will scar the child for life,\u201d Mr. Dongeto said.\\r\\n<br>Salvador Panelo, a spokesman for Mr. Duterte, said the current law gave drug gangs an incentive to use children for criminal activities \u201cbecause they know the children will be freed.\u201d He said Mr. Duterte wanted to \u201cprotect the children\u201d by amending the law.\\r\\n<p>\u201cBecause if you have a law that will criminalize this particular age bracket, then the criminals will not use them,\u201d Mr. Panelo said.\\r\\n<br>He cited reports by the Philippine National Police and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency that drug gangs were using children younger than 15 in their operations. But Mr. Dongeto said government statistics showed that less than 2 percent of all crimes were committed by children.\\r\\n<br>On Monday, the national police said that from January 2017 to December 2018, more than 1,300 minors had been arrested in connection with illegal drugs. They were mostly used as \u201cdrug runners,\u201d or mules, because criminals know that children cannot be prosecuted under present laws, the police said.\\r\\n<br>Senator Francis Pangilinan, an opposition leader and the author of the current juvenile justice law, said on Tuesday that the majority of children who committed crimes came from poor families and were simply trying to survive. Rather than targeting children, he said, the police should pursue high-level criminals and drug traffickers more effectively.\\r\\n<br>\u201cAn iron fist is not the solution. Jailing our kids and mistreating are not solutions,\u201d said Mr. Pangilinan, who vowed to block the proposed amendments in the Senate. \u201cGo after big crooks, and reform 9-year-olds.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Senator Grace Poe, who has opposed previous attempts to lower the age for criminal prosecution, agreed.\\r\\n<br>\u201cBy lowering the age of criminality to 9, we will be creating kindergarten prisons, and instead of rehabilitating children, these will become finishing schools for young criminals, their impressionable minds tutored by the best in the trade,\u201d she said in a statement.\\r\\n<p>The independent Commission on Human Rights has also expressed \u201cstrong opposition\u201d to the bill.\\r\\n<br>\u201cWe urge the government to address conditions that push children to such circumstances, rather than placing the burden on a child for failures of institutions meant to protect them,\u201d Jacqueline Ann de Guia, a spokeswoman for the commission, said in an interview.\\r\\n<br>Ms. de Guia noted that the Philippines is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which states that imprisonment is to be used \u201conly as a measure of last resort.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Mr. Panelo, the president\u2019s spokesman, said Mr. Duterte would not interfere with legislators\u2019 work, but that the Senate would probably not take long passing the bill because it had already been approved by the House committee.\\r\\n<br>\u201cIt\u2019s now up to the Senate.

What is a fecal transplant, and why would I want one?\\r\\n<br>A. Fecal transplant is a medical procedure in which stool from a healthy donor is introduced into the intestine of a patient as a treatment for a disease. The idea is that the stool from the donor contains a healthful mix of gut bacteria that can seed the intestine of the patient, bringing healthful results.\\r\\n<br>While the procedure may sound highly unappealing, it is not unsanitary. Stool is obtained from a donor or from a stool bank, where it has been screened for pathogens and processed for medical use.\\r\\n<br>Donor stool may be administered via a plastic tube inserted through the nose into the stomach or small intestine. Alternatively, donor stool may be introduced into the colon via an enema or colonoscopy, or by swallowing a capsule of stool.\\r\\n<br>Fecal transplant is used as a treatment for a serious infection of the colon with Clostridium difficile, a harmful bacterium that can take hold if antibiotics kill off enough of a person\u2019s \u201cgood\u201d gut bacteria. In 2011, C. diff caused some half a million infections, 29,000 deaths and $4.8 billion in health care costs in the United States alone.\\r\\n<p>A watershed moment in the use of fecal transplant, or what\u2019s known in the medical literature as fecal microbiota transplant, occurred in 1958, when doctors tried the procedure as a last-ditch, heroic measure in four patients with life-threatening C. diff. Remarkably, all four patients survived. The results were described as \u201cimmediate and dramatic,\u201d but because of a general revulsion to the thought of ingesting stool, fecal transplant still failed to win mainstream acceptance.\\r\\n<br>The tipping point occurred in 2013, with the publication of a landmark study showing fecal transplant to be superior to vancomycin, the current gold standard treatment for C. diff. Larger studies soon confirmed and extended these results.\\r\\n<br>Fecal transplant is now being studied as a treatment for obesity, recurrent urinary tract infections, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome and a host of other conditions.\\r\\n<br>The preliminary data are encouraging, but enthusiasm must be tempered. The Food and Drug Administration regards fecal transplant as an \u201cinvestigational new drug\u201d and has not approved it for general use. Medical insurers typically cover fecal transplant only as a treatment for recurrent, intractable C. diff.\\r\\n<br>Reported side effects have been mild and include diarrhea, cramps, nausea, constipation and flatulence, though the trials performed to date have not been large enough to detect potentially more serious problems.\\r\\n<p>Experts offer this final piece of sage advice: \u201cIt is not recommended to perform stool transplantation at home without guidance from a physician.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Do you have a health question?

She wound up texting one of her therapy clients with a message intended for her ex-husband. (The client\u2019s response: \u201cI didn\u2019t realize I made you so angry!\u201d)\\r\\n<br>Bob Pyle and his wife both worked in the same Wall Street firm. One day, he corrected a bunch of typos in a document she had written \u2014 and accidentally shared his critique with 200 people in the company. \u201cAbout an hour later, my boss came into work, passing my door on the way to his office,\u201d he explained, and said, \u201cSleeping on the couch tonight?\u201d\\r\\n<br>And Erin Weltzien was once part of a group chat whose topic drifted into complaining about a co-worker, Jen, flaunting her \u201cnewly enhanced breasts.\u201d The subject promptly changed when the participants read, in the chat window: \u201cThis is Jen\u2019s father!

Janet Katz told people she was the victim of a computer virus. \u201cI blame a small child \u2014 son, niece, nephew, whatever,\u201d Roanne Martin said.\\r\\n<br>Sharyn Tom pointed out that you don\u2019t have to defuse the fallout alone. \u201cEnlist someone you have good rapport with to Reply All to your Reply All, and say something funny to cut the tension, like, \u2018Great story, bro, we appreciate the update!\u2019\u201d she suggests. \u201cThe other person helps by taking the focus and embarrassment away from you, and pivots into humor or something useful.\u201d\\r\\n<br>In general, though, the wisest course seems to be quick action and a huge helping of humble pie.\\r\\n<br>\u201cI just call it what it is by sending yet another Reply All message like: \u2018Well, that was awkward,\u2019\u201d Sheryl Moore wrote. \u201cUsually that is met with kind and understanding replies.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Or, as Cassandra Kiger put it, \u201cYou own it, make apologies, spend 48 hours in shame, and move on.\u201d\\r\\n<h2>Five ways to avoid Reply All nightmares\\r\\n<br>Most people endure a botched Reply All episode only once. After that searing experience, you\u2019re unlikely to make the same mistake again.\\r\\n<br>But you can avoid the fiasco in the first place. Here\u2019s how:\\r\\n<br>Enter the address last. Jeff Branzburg has cultivated the habit of clicking Forward, not Reply, when answering messages. That way, the Address box of every reply starts out empty. \u201cCompose the email, and only then go back and enter the address(es),\u201d he says. This technique requires extra steps, but it guarantees you\u2019ll never accidentally Reply to All.\\r\\n<br>Give yourself an \u201cOh no!\u201d window. In some email programs, you can set up a freakout delay. Your email will wait 60 seconds (or more) after you click Send, giving you a window in which to realize your gaffe and stop the message in its tracks.\\r\\n<br>You can set this up in Microsoft Outlook or in Gmail. If you\u2019re a Mac person, you need the free version of a plug-in called Mail Butler to add this feature to Apple\u2019s Mail program.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThe \u2018oh no filter\u2019 gives you enough time to correct errors,\u201d Gerard Stijntjes notes. \u201cI\u2019ve shared it around at work and it is helping.\u201d\\r\\n<br>If Microsoft Outlook dominates your email life, as it does in many organizations, you have three additional safety nets at your disposal:\\r\\n<br>Remove the Reply All button on your end. The Reply All button can\u2019t ruin your life if it doesn\u2019t exist, can it? In Outlook, you can move the button to a remote Siberian outpost on the toolbar so it\u2019s harder to hit by mistake. (Here\u2019s how to do it.)\\r\\n<br>The beauty of this toolbar surgery is that it doesn\u2019t fully deprive you of the Reply to All function. When you really intend to trigger it, you can always choose the equivalent menu command. \u201cProblem solved, as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d Andreas Molke noted.\\r\\n<p>Remove the Reply All button on their end. If you and your recipients are all using Microsoft Outlook, you can, weirdly enough, disable their Reply All buttons on messages you send. As @NYG_Steve notes, it\u2019s your way of preventing other people from making Reply All gaffes based on your original message. All you need is the free NoReplyAll add-in for Outlook.\\r\\n<br>\\r\\n<p>Undo send. Lara F. recommends using Microsoft Outlook\u2019s Recall command, which magically deletes a message from the recipients\u2019 Inboxes before they\u2019ve opened it. Alas, it works only when you and you recipients are in the same company (using the same Microsoft Exchange server), you all use Outlook, and each recipient hasn\u2019t yet seen the message.\\r\\n<br>In all other circumstances, this command winds up sending a second email that says, for example, \u201cCasey Robin would like to recall the message, \u2018My boss is a toxic, sniveling misanthrope.\u2019\u201d Unfortunately, that message may serve only to draw more attention to the first one.\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<h2>What else is wrong with Reply All\\r\\n<br>The Reply All button should be considered armed and dangerous. In law firms and government departments, it can transmit confidential information to people who shouldn\u2019t have it. In any company, its use can become a drag on efficiency and sanity. (Every time you send \u201cThanks!\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re welcome!\u201d emails on a thread of 850 employees, that\u2019s 850 people who must manually delete those messages, usually quietly cursing your name.)\\r\\n<p>Things get really bad when a Reply All storm touches down. That\u2019s when one reply to the entire organization inspires hundreds of people to Reply All with \u201cPlease take me off this list\u201d messages, which triggers round after round of \u201cMe too\u201d and \u201cStop hitting Reply All!\u201d (and \u201cOut of Office\u201d messages, each also going to everyone on the list). The quantity of messages explodes geometrically until the entire outfit is brought to its knees.\\r\\n<br>What email programs need, of course, is some kind of built-in protection against Reply All tragedies. Apple, Microsoft and Google should offer an option that produces an \u201cAre you sure?\u201d message before your message is actually sent.\\r\\n<br>Until then, be careful out there. You don\u2019t deserve this kind of \u2014 what\u2019s the right word for it? \u2014 humailiation.\\r\\n<br>In the next Crowdwise: Some of the things people say to grieving friends and relatives \u2014 \u201cWell, she\u2019s in a better place now,\u201d or \u201cWell, at least you still have other children\u201d \u2014 don\u2019t provide comfort, and may actually make things worse. \\r\\n<br>What are some of the worst examples you\u2019ve experienced?

The two countries are racing to strike an agreement by March 2, a deadline set by President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China.\\r\\n<br>If no deal is reached by that date, Mr. Trump has said the United States will raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.\\r\\n<p>Mr. Trump has focused on narrowing the trade gap between what the United States imports from China and what it exports, but the administration is also pressuring Beijing to scale back subsidies of state-owned enterprises, drastically open its markets to foreign investment and end its longstanding practice of forcing American companies to hand over trade secrets.\\r\\n<br>For years, American companies, including technology firms and automakers, have been clamoring for such changes as they try to gain access to China\u2019s growing market. But many are beginning to fear that if the continuing brinkmanship between the world\u2019s two largest economies is not resolved, American companies will be left in an even worse position.\\r\\n<br>\u201cI would have a hard time, especially considering what\u2019s happening in Washington, believing that this will be wrapped up in a little bow by March,\u201d said Charles Freeman, senior vice president for Asia at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\\r\\n<br>Markets have been particularly sensitive to the state of the talks, with stocks gyrating as whispers of progress or setbacks trickle out.\\r\\n<br>Stock prices in the United States spiked last week after a Wall Street Journal report suggested that Mr. Mnuchin had recommended the removal of some tariffs to hasten a deal. They jumped again after Bloomberg News reported that China had offered to buy $1 trillion of American goods over the next six years.\\r\\n<p>Over the weekend, Mr. Trump expressed hope that a deal could be reached but dismissed suggestions that the United States would roll back tariffs in advance of concessions from China.\\r\\n<br>\u201cWe have taken in tremendous amounts of money in the United States because of the sanctions,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters on Saturday, apparently confusing sanctions and tariffs. \u201cIf we make a deal, certainly we wouldn\u2019t have sanctions.\u201d\\r\\n<br>In a tweet on Monday evening, Mr. Trump once again suggested that the United States had the upper hand in negotiations, saying China\u2019s slowing economy should hasten a trade deal.\\r\\n<br>\u201cChina posts slowest economic numbers since 1990 due to U.S. trade tensions and new policies,\u201d the president said. \u201cMakes so much sense for China to finally do a Real Deal, and stop playing around!\u201d\\r\\n<p>Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s optimism about reaching a deal, others in the administration and on Capitol Hill have been more circumspect.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThis is an ongoing process with the Chinese that is nowhere near completion,\u201d a Treasury spokesman said, rebutting the suggestion that Mr. Mnuchin had recommended rolling back tariffs.\\r\\n<br>Last week, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said that Mr. Lighthizer, who is leading the talks, had told him there had been no progress on the \u201cstructural\u201d changes that the administration sought from China.\\r\\n<p>Mr. Lighthizer, a longtime China hawk, has been pushing to ensure that China fulfills promises that Mr. Xi made to Mr. Trump during a meeting in Buenos Aires last year. Mr. Lighthizer has expressed concern to colleagues and business groups that Mr. Trump could accept a watered-down deal that reduces the trade deficit but offers only symbolic structural changes to help end the trade war and lift the stock market.\\r\\n<p>In an interview on the Fox Business Network on Friday, Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, said he was hopeful that a deal would be reached but acknowledged that many details still needed to be determined.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThe technology stuff has not been dealt with, the enforcement stuff has not been dealt with,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said. \u201cThe commodity stuff and the tariff rates, we\u2019re moving on the right track.\u201d\\r\\n<br>To those who see the negotiations as the best opportunity to rebalance the trade relationship between Washington and Beijing, the prospect of rolling back tariffs without sweeping concessions by China would fail to achieve Mr. Trump\u2019s goal of ending what he has deemed its unfair trade practices.\\r\\n<br>\u201cHe wants to brag about what he got, not stop tariffs and be able to brag about nothing,\u201d said Derek Scissors, a China expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.\\r\\n<br>A slimmed-down deal could also open Mr. Trump up to criticism from Democrats, who in some cases are more aligned with the president\u2019s aggressive approach to pressuring China than many Republicans.\\r\\n<br>\u201cAnything less than a full effort to secure a fundamental reset of the U.S.-China trade relationship is a betrayal of the American economy and the future of American workers, industry, consumers and innovators,\u201d said Representative Richard Neal of Massachusetts, the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. \u201cThe Trump administration needs to stiffen its spine and get tough in these China talks.\u201d\\r\\n<p>Trump administration officials have been debating whether they can push more tariffs on China without facing significant repercussions. China\u2019s economy is already slowing, in part because of the tariffs, and any further weakening could hurt global economic growth and the United States economy, which is itself showing signs of cooling.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Mnuchin has been particularly interested in how big a role America\u2019s trade actions are playing in China\u2019s recent economic weakness.\\r\\n<br>Trump administration officials have debated whether they should follow through with plans to raise tariffs to 25 percent, from 10 percent, on March 2 if China does not maintain the promises Mr. Xi made to Mr. Trump, like accelerating purchases of American goods and making structural changes to its economy.\\r\\n<br>Progress over the next six weeks could result in an extension of the March 2 deadline, even if a final deal is not reached, or some tariff relief as a reward for initial changes that China says it is willing to make. But the decision will ultimately rest with Mr. Trump.\\r\\n<br>One question bedeviling the talks is how to enforce any trade agreement with China, given its opaque business environment and largely managed economy. One option that administration officials have considered is \u201csnapback\u201d tariffs, which would be reimposed if China appears to be reneging on its commitments.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Trump has pointed to China\u2019s economic weakness as a reason it should acquiesce to his country\u2019s trade demands. But the trade war is also taking a toll on the United States economy, and the monthlong shutdown could lead to an economic contraction if it continues to drag on.\\r\\n<br>While business are hoping for greater access to China\u2019s markets, the strategy of using tariffs as a negotiating tool has dented business confidence. According to a survey of 277 American companies by S&P Global this month, 43 percent said they had postponed investment because of the China tariffs.\\r\\n<p>Michael Pillsbury, a China scholar at the Hudson Institute who advises the administration, said that there were several important unknowns about the trade discussions that suggested a comprehensive deal was not near.\\r\\n<br>It remains unclear if there is a working text of a deal that the two countries are using to hash out an agreement. And it is unclear whether China will pressure the Trump administration to drop its efforts to extradite the chief financial officer of Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications company. The executive was arrested in Canada last year as part of a broader agreement. The complicated internal debates taking place within China\u2019s government also make it difficult to predict its willingness to make concessions.\\r\\n<br>\u201cWe are a long way to a deal,\u201d Mr. Pillsbury said. \u201cMuch work remains to be done, especially untangling the debate in China and pressure on Xi Jinping.\u201d\\r\\n<br>But Mr. Trump is also under pressure and the window for him to use market-rattling tariffs as leverage is likely to shrink as his re-election campaign heats up next year.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThe damage to U.S. business, consumers and exporters is real and ongoing,\u201d Scott Lincicome, a trade lawyer and scholar at the Cato Institute, said, noting that the risks of this approach only increased if negotiations with China dragged into 2020. \u201cIf you\u2019re the Chinese, delay is your best friend.\u201d\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"business.12.txt\",\"id\":-1413757249},{\"title\":\"Government Shutdown: Updates on Where Things Stand\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"It has now been a month since the first day of the government shutdown, which has had wide-ranging effects across the United States.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>Updated Jan. 22\\r\\n<h2>Day 32: What\u2019s been happening?\\r\\n<br>It has been a month since the first day of the government shutdown.\\r\\n<br>Furloughed federal employees have started part-time jobs with delivery and ride-hailing apps and applied for other opportunities, such as yoga-instructor positions, to try to make ends meet without a government paycheck.\\r\\n<br>Some of the most vulnerable Americans \u2014 including the homeless, the elderly and people one crisis away from the streets \u2014 are feeling the burden.

Immigrants in Texas are skeptical of the president\u2019s proposal.\\r\\n<br>While Mr. Trump has projected confidence in public, he has expressed private frustration over what he views as negative coverage.

The number of people working has grown as the Trump administration reinterprets longstanding rules, often to the benefit of the president\u2019s base.\\r\\n<p>Many federal workers have filed for unemployment benefits. In Washington, local programs have sprouted up to support the city\u2019s large, struggling federal work force.

Some courts have delayed civil cases, and court-appointed lawyers have not been paid at all.\\r\\n<br>[A typical federal worker has missed $5,000 in pay from the shutdown so far.]\\r\\n<h2>The rippling effects on the economy\\r\\n<br>The White House admitted recently that the shutdown has had a far greater toll on the United States economy than previously thought.\\r\\n<br>Americans are confident in their own finances, but have become increasingly concerned about the economy overall during the shutdown, according to a recent poll conducted for The New York Times by the online research firm SurveyMonkey.\\r\\n<br>Low-income Americans whose leases are subsidized by the government are worried about their rent because the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which is closed, cannot make payments to landlords.\\r\\n<br>Legions of contractors are out of work and, unlike federal employees working without pay, they have no expectation of recovering the missed wages.\\r\\n<p>For American farmers, the shutdown has compounded concerns about Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war with China. To ease their pain, the president created a $12 billion bailout fund, but that is frozen because of the shutdown. Last week, the Agriculture Department said that it would temporarily call back about 2,500 workers to help farmers and ranchers with existing loans and to provide them with necessary tax documents.\\r\\n<br>The shutdown has had cascading effects, too.

That acute pain is letting you know that a part of your body needs to heal, or in some other way needs extra attention, said Dr. Neil Schechter, the director of the chronic pain clinic at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital.\\r\\n<br>That\u2019s very different, he said, from chronic pain that goes on over the course of months, whether abdominal pain or headache or musculoskeletal \u2014 it may persist and be incapacitating, because \u201cthe pain has become the disease.\u201d\\r\\n<br>That doesn\u2019t mean the pain is any less painful for the person experiencing it.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThere is really strong evidence supporting the psychological treatment for chronic pain, and that doesn\u2019t imply that the pain itself is a psychological problem,\u201d said Rachael Coakley, a psychologist who is the director of clinical innovation and outreach in pain medicine at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital. Her book, \u201cWhen Your Child Hurts,\u201d is an excellent resource for parents.\\r\\n<br>\u201cWhen you\u2019re a kid and you\u2019ve had pain for a really long time, a lot of that is an experience of not having control over what\u2019s happening in your body,\u201d said Anna C. Wilson, a pediatric pain psychologist at Oregon Health and Science University. \u201cRelaxation and other biobehavioral techniques help kids gain a sense of control.\u201d\\r\\n<p>She tells patients, \u201cYour pain is absolutely real, and chronic pain in particular is a neurologic problem.\u201d She recommended TED Talks by Dr. Elliot Krane, an anesthesiologist, and Lorimer Moseley, a neuroscience professor, to help explain chronic pain.\\r\\n<br>Chronic pain develops, Dr. Schechter said, when there is an underlying biological vulnerability, either inherited or resulting from stressors like infections or procedures or traumas, and then a triggering event, such as a gastrointestinal infection or an injury.\\r\\n<br>As many as one in five children may experience chronic pain, which is defined as lasting for three months or more, Dr. Coakley said. They may reduce their activities because of the pain, missing school and falling behind, which brings additional stress and anxiety. They may also need psychological help with anxiety and depression because they have lived with chronic pain and its consequences. \\r\\n<br>But children often do better in recovering from chronic pain than adults do, Dr. Schechter said, because their brains and their nervous systems are more plastic. With proper treatment, \u201cthe majority of children are significantly helped with pain problems, and for many the pain disappears completely,\u201d he said.\\r\\n<br>[Read more on dealing with chronic pain. | Sign up for the Well Family newsletter.]\\r\\n<br>In the United States,  about four to eight million children  have missed school in the last months because of pain, said Dr. Stefan Friedrichsdorf, the medical director of pain medicine and palliative care at Children\u2019s Minnesota. \\r\\n<p>The best place for these children to get care, Dr. Friedrichsdorf said, is in a pediatric pain clinic. Ideally, the children are seen by a team including a physician or nurse practitioner, a designated pain psychologist, a physical therapist, and a social worker whose job includes taking care of the parents.\\r\\n<br>Pediatric pain clinics are available in 26 states. If there is no clinic near where a family lives, or if the waiting list is prohibitively long, Dr. Friedrichsdorf recommends that parents try to put a team together themselves: Work with your pediatrician to find a physical therapist and a psychologist who can help.\\r\\n<br>The most important message for these children and parents, who often have already gone from doctor to doctor experiencing one diagnostic procedure after another, he said, is \u201cwe explain to them why the pain is real, and a large number of the kids actually start crying because they feel not believed.\u201d The experts reassure children and their families that the pain will usually go away, but it will take a lot of hard work.\\r\\n<br>Children who live with chronic pain have often cut back all their normal activities, and the priority, Dr. Friedrichsdorf said, is to get \u201cthe four S\u2019s\u201d back to normal: school, sports, social life and sleep. \u201cFirst you go back to school full time, and second you get better; it\u2019s not the other way around,\u201d he said.\\r\\n<br>There may be a lot of fear and anxiety that movement and exercise will hurt, Dr. Wilson said, but \u201cthe pain they\u2019re experiencing is not a message that something threatening or dangerous is happening, and once the family understands that, it\u2019s easier to work toward having the kid do more movement, and movement is really essential.\u201d Chronic pain, Dr. Schechter said, \u201cis hurtful but not harmful.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Dr. Coakley said: \u201cI\u2019ll often say that having chronic pain is like a tricycle with three flat tires, and to get them going again we have to fill each of the tires.\u201d One tire might be filled with medications \u2014 and rather than painkillers, these might include drugs that treat the nervous system, from certain antidepressants to seizure medications. Another tire might be filled with an activity program, and a third with cognitive behavioral therapy, she said.\\r\\n<br>Children can learn mind-body techniques such as diaphragmatic breathing, guided imagery, mindfulness and biofeedback. Dr. Coakley compared these to \u201cdimmer switches\u201d for the nervous system, dialing down the sensitivity. And children and parents can use what she called \u201ccircuit-breaker strategies\u201d to disrupt the habit cycles and behavior patterns that have built up around chronic pain.\\r\\n<p>She asks parents to stop checking in frequently about how a child is feeling so children won\u2019t be thinking, \u201chow do I feel now, do I hurt, and how much?\u201d\\r\\n<br>Christine Chambers, a professor and children\u2019s pain researcher at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, said she tells families that \u201cthe pain system is supposed to work like your body\u2019s alarm system and tell you when something is wrong.\u201d Usually that alarm system works very well for acute pain, she said, but \u201cwhen you have a lot of pain early in life, the alarm system can start to malfunction, and you see the pain alarm system going off even though there is no acute reason.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Children need to learn strategies to turn the oversensitive alarm down, or to pay less attention to it.\\r\\n<br>Dr. Coakley founded a program called the Comfort Ability, which offers one-day workshops at sites around the country for adolescents and their parents, teaching strategies for understanding and managing chronic pain (financial assistance is often available, and there are many resources on the website as well).\\r\\n<br>\u201cHow we approach and treat chronic pain often feels counterintuitive at the beginning of the journey,\u201d said Dr. Coakley. Parents may feel that focusing on pain management means that the medical system has stopped looking for the underlying problem, she said, but in fact, \u201cthe vast majority of the kids we treat in this multidisciplinary approach get better \u2014 this is actually the treatment for the problem.\u201d\\r\\n<br>This is the third in a series of columns on children\u2019s pain.

If so, its bioweapons would act as a potent deterrent. \\r\\n<br>But experts also worry about offensive strikes and agents of unusual lethality, especially the smallpox virus, which spreads person-to-person and kills a third of its victims. Experts have long suspected that the North harbors the germ, which in 1980 was declared eradicated from human populations.\\r\\n<br>Worse, analysts say, satellite images and internet scrutiny of the North suggest that Pyongyang is newly interested in biotechnology and germ advances. In 2015, state media showed Kim Jong-un, the nation\u2019s leader, touring a biological plant, echoing his nuclear propaganda.\\r\\n<br>But compared to traditional weapons, biological threats have a host of unsettling distinctions: Germ production is small-scale and far less expensive than creating nuclear arms. Deadly microbes can look like harmless components of vaccine and agricultural work. And living weapons are hard to detect, trace and contain.\\r\\n<p>The North\u2019s great secrecy makes it hard to assess the threat and the country\u2019s degree of sophistication.

President Trump did not broach the subject of biological weapons during his meeting with Mr. Kim in Singapore, according to American officials.\\r\\n<br>The lack of detail and urgency is all the more surprising given that John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, has long described it as a regional and even a global threat.\\r\\n<br>In 2002, as under secretary of state for arms control and international security in the George W. Bush administration, Mr. Bolton declared that \u201cNorth Korea has one of the most robust offensive bioweapons programs on Earth.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Last century, most nations that made biological arms gave them up as impractical. Capricious winds could carry deadly agents back on users, infecting troops and citizens. The United States renounced its arsenal in 1969.\\r\\n<br>But today, analysts say, the gene revolution could be making germ weapons more attractive. They see the possibility of designer pathogens that spread faster, infect more people, resist treatment, and offer better targeting and containment. If so, North Korea may be in the forefront.\\r\\n<br>South Korean military white papers have identified at least ten facilities in the North that could be involved in the research and production of more than a dozen biological agents, including those that cause the plague and hemorrhagic fevers.\\r\\n<p>United States intelligence officials have not publicly endorsed those findings. But many experts say the technological hurdles to such advances have collapsed. The North, for instance, has received advanced microbiology training from institutions in Asia and Europe.\\r\\n<br>Bruce Bennett, a defense researcher at the RAND Corporation, said defectors from the North have described witnessing the testing of biological agents on political prisoners.\\r\\n<br>Several North Korean military defectors have tested positive for smallpox antibodies, suggesting they were either exposed to the deadly virus or vaccinated against it, according to a report by Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.\\r\\n<br>Smallpox claimed up to a half billion lives before it was declared eradicated.

The collaborations may violate international sanctions. \\r\\n<p>Joseph S.

The photos showed enormous fermenters for growing microbes, as well as spray dryers that can turn bacterial spores into a powder fine enough to be inhaled. Mr. Kim was beaming.\\r\\n<br>Melissa Hanham, a scholar who first identified the site\u2019s threatening potential, said equipment model numbers showed that the North had obtained the machinery by evading sanctions \u2014 laundering money, creating front companies or bribing people to buy it on the black market.\\r\\n<br>She said the evidence suggests the North succeeded in building a seemingly harmless agricultural plant that could be repurposed within weeks to produce dried anthrax spores.\\r\\n<br>Arms-control analysts say intrusive inspections are needed to see whether a facility is intended for peaceful aims or something else.\\r\\n<br>\u201cA nuclear weapons facility has very visible signals to the outside world,\u201d Mr. Bermudez said. \u201cWe can look at it and immediately say, \u2018Ugh, that\u2019s a nuclear reactor.\u2019 But the technology for conducting biological weapons research is essentially the same as what keeps a population healthy.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Americans felt the sting of bioweapons in 2001 when a teaspoon of anthrax powder, dispatched in a handful of envelopes, killed five people, sickened 17 more and set off a nationwide panic.

Instead, Dr. Zuboff writes, they represent a new and problematic market form that trades in predicting and influencing human behavior.\\r\\n<br>\u201cSurveillance capitalism has taken human experience, specifically private human experience, and unilaterally claimed it as something to be bought and sold in the marketplace,\u201d Dr. Zuboff told me during a visit to The Times\u2019s office. \u201cThis new kind of marketplace trades in behavioral futures. It\u2019s like a form of derivative. But it\u2019s about us.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Yet most of us are not aware that platforms like Google and Facebook may track and analyze our every search, location, like, video, photo, post and punctuation mark the better to try to sway us, she said.\\r\\n<br>In fact, a new study on Facebook from the Pew Research Center illustrates how opaque this behavior marketplace can be to consumers.\\r\\n<br>The study, my colleague Sapna Maheswari writes, reported that about three-fourths of Facebook users were unaware that the social network maintained lists of their personal interests, such as their political leanings, for advertisers. And about half of users who looked at their \u201cad preferences\u201d \u2014 the Facebook pages displaying these details \u2014 said they were uncomfortable with the company\u2019s creating lists of categories about them.\\r\\n<p>The technologies that power the behavior speculation market, of course, have spread far beyond online ads.\\r\\n<br>They enable auto insurers to surveil drivers and offer discounts based on their driving performance. They allow workplace wellness programs to charge higher health insurance premiums to employees who decline to wear fitness trackers.

Pretty soon, however, Google began harvesting this surplus information, along with other details like users\u2019 web-browsing activities, to infer their interests and target them with ads.\\r\\n<br>The model was later adopted by Facebook.\\r\\n<br>The companies\u2019 pivot \u2014 from serving to surveilling their users \u2014 pushed Google and Facebook to harvest more and more data, Dr. Zuboff writes. In doing so, the companies sometimes bypassed privacy settings or made it difficult for users to opt out of data-sharing.\\r\\n<br>\u201cWe saw these digital services were free, and we thought, you know, \u2018We\u2019re making a reasonable trade-off with giving them valuable data,\u2019\u201d Dr. Zuboff told me. \u201cBut now that\u2019s reversed. They\u2019ve decided that we\u2019re free, that they can take our experience for free and translate it into behavioral data. And so we are just the source of raw material.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Of course, tech companies tend to bristle at the word \u201csurveillance.\u201d They associate it with government spying on individuals \u2014 not with their own snooping on users and trying to sway them at scale.\\r\\n<br>\u201cWhen organizations do surveillance, people don\u2019t have control over that,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief, said in April during a Senate hearing on Cambridge Analytica, the voter-profiling company that improperly harvested the data of millions of Facebook users. \u201cBut on Facebook, everything that you share, you have control over.\u201d\\r\\n<p>Surveillance, however, simply means observation or supervision, often with the intent of channeling the surveilled in a particular direction. As Dr. Zuboff\u2019s book points out, that is at the core of Facebook\u2019s panopticon of a business model.\\r\\n<br>In other news:\\r\\n<br>\u25a0 Microsoft pledged nearly $500 million in loans to help build affordable housing in the Seattle area.

More than 30 million Americans have Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, and most use several test strips daily to monitor their condition.\\r\\n<br>But at this store on W. 116th Street, each strip is also a lucrative commodity, part of an informal economy in unused strips nationwide. Often the sellers are insured and paid little out of pocket for the strips; the buyers may be underinsured or uninsured, and unable to pay retail prices, which can run well over $100 for a box of 100 strips.\\r\\n<br>Some clinicians are surprised to learn of this vast resale market, but it has existed for decades, an unusual example of the vagaries of American health care. Unlike the resale of prescription drugs, which is prohibited by law, it is generally legal to resell unused test strips. \\r\\n<p>And this store is far from the only place buying. Mobile phones light up with robo-texts: \u201cWe buy diabetic test strips!\u201d Online, scores of companies thrive with names like TestStripSearch.com and QuickCash4TestStrips.com.\\r\\n<br>\u201cI\u2019m taking advantage, as are my peers, of a loophole,\u201d said the owner of one popular site, who asked that his name not be used. \u201cWe\u2019re allowed to do that. I don\u2019t even think we should be, frankly.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Test strips were first developed in 1965 to provide an immediate reading of blood sugar, or glucose, levels. The user pricks a finger, places a drop of blood on the strip, and inserts it into a meter that provides a reading.\\r\\n<br>The test strips were created for use in doctors\u2019 offices, but by 1980 medical-device manufacturers had designed meters for home use. They became the standard of care for many people with diabetes, who test their blood as often as ten times a day.\\r\\n<p>Test strips are a multi-billion-dollar industry. A 2012 study found that among insulin-dependent patients who monitor their blood sugar, strips accounted for nearly one-quarter of pharmacy costs. Today, four manufacturers account for half of global sales.\\r\\n<p>In a retail pharmacy, name-brand strips command high prices. But like most goods and services in American health care, that number doesn\u2019t reflect what most people pay.\\r\\n<br>The sticker price is the result of behind-the-scenes negotiations between the strips\u2019 manufacturer and insurers. Manufacturers set a high list price and then negotiate to become an insurer\u2019s preferred supplier by offering a hefty rebate. \\r\\n<br>These transactions are invisible to the insured consumer, who might cover a copay, at most. But the arrangement leaves the uninsured \u2014 those least able to pay \u2014 paying sky-high sticker prices out of pocket. Also left out are the underinsured, who may need to first satisfy a high deductible. \\r\\n<br>For a patient testing their blood many times a day, paying for strips out-of-pocket could add up to thousands of dollars a year. Small wonder, then, that a gray market thrives. The middlemen buy extras from people who obtained strips through insurance, at little cost to themselves, and then resell to the less fortunate.\\r\\n<br>That was the opportunity that caught Chad Langley\u2019s eye. He and his twin brother launched the website Teststripz.com to solicit test strips from the public for resale. Today they buy strips from roughly 8,000 people; their third-floor office in Reading, Mass., receives around 100 deliveries a day.\\r\\n<br>The amount the Langleys pay depends on the brand, expiration date and condition, but the profit margins are reliably high. For example, the brothers will pay $35 plus shipping for a 100-count box of the popular brand Freestyle Lite in mint condition.\\r\\n<br>The Langleys sell the box for $60. CVS, by contrast, retails the strips for $164.\\r\\n<br>The Langleys are mainly buying up excess strips from insured patients who have been flooded with them, sometimes even when not medically necessary. \\r\\n<p>Although patients who manage their diabetes with non-insulin medications or with diet and exercise needn\u2019t test their blood sugar daily, a recent analysis of insurance claims found that nearly one in seven patients still used test strips regularly.\\r\\n<h2>\u2018It\u2019s a tiny little piece of plastic that\u2019s super cheap to manufacture, and they\u2019ve managed to make a cash cow out of it.\u2019\\r\\n<br>Gretchen Obrist\\r\\n<br>The market glut is also a consequence of a strategy adopted by manufacturers to sell patients proprietary meters designed to read only their brand of strips. If a patient\u2019s insurer shifts her to a new brand, she must get a new meter, often leaving behind a supply of useless strips.\\r\\n<br>While some resellers use websites like Amazon or eBay to market strips directly to consumers, the biggest profits are in returning them to retail pharmacies, which sell them as new and bill the customer\u2019s insurance the full price.\\r\\n<br>The insurer reimburses the pharmacy the retail price and then demands a partial rebate from the manufacturer \u2014 but it\u2019s a rebate the manufacturer has paid already for this box of strips.\\r\\n<p>Glenn Johnson, general manager for market access at Abbott Diabetes Care, which makes about one in five strips purchased in the United States, said manufacturers lose more than $100 million in profits a year this way, much of it in New York, California and Florida.\\r\\n<br>The company supported a new California law that prohibits pharmacies from acquiring test strips from any but an authorized list of distributors. Mr. Johnson said he has spoken with lawmakers about similar efforts in Florida, New Jersey, New York and Ohio.\\r\\n<br>Such measures leave intact the inflated retail prices that make the gray market possible and which critics say benefit manufacturers and their retail intermediaries, pharmacy benefit managers.\\r\\n<p>In a lawsuit against P.B.M.\u2019s and the dominant test strip manufacturers filed in New Jersey, consumer advocates presented data showing that the average wholesale price for test strips has risen as much as 70 percent over the last decade.\\r\\n<br>They alleged that this has allowed the defendants to pocket an unfair portion of the rebates. The price of a strip would be much lower if it wasn\u2019t fattened by profiteering, said Gretchen Obrist, one of the lawyers who brought the case.\\r\\n<br>\u201cIt\u2019s a tiny little piece of plastic that\u2019s super cheap to manufacture, and they\u2019ve managed to make a cash cow out of it,\u201d she said.\\r\\n<br>To justify the rising price of strips, manufacturers point to advances in engineering that have made the strips smaller and more convenient to use. But there is little evidence those features have improved health outcomes for people with diabetes \u2014 and with increasingly unaffordable prices, the newfangled test strips may be even less accessible.\\r\\n<br>The markups on strips look particularly stark when compared to the cost of producing them.\\r\\n<br>\u201cTest strips are basically printed, like in a printing press,\u201d said David Kliff, who publishes a newsletter on diabetes. \u201cIt\u2019s not brain surgery.\u201d\\r\\n<br>He estimated the typical test strip costs less than a dime to make. \",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"health.8.txt\",\"id\":-787975219},{\"title\":\"On Technology: How Secrecy Fuels Facebook Paranoia\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"The social platform knows everything that happens within its walls \u2014 that\u2019s the whole point \u2014 but it is oddly reticent when it comes to misinformation campaigns.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>In December of last year, the Senate Intelligence Committee released two reports it had commissioned concerning Russia\u2019s efforts to influence the 2016 election. The outline of the interference effort has always been easy to make out, but key questions about its significance \u2014 Could Russia really affect voter sentiment by posting? Did trolls really lower voter turnout in key states? \u2014 are still, in large part, matters for speculation. And the committee\u2019s findings did little to change that.\\r\\n<br>On the subject of Facebook, for example, the reports analyzed new internal data on the campaign efforts of the Internet Research Agency, Russia\u2019s \u201ctroll farm,\u201d and offered some examples of its work. We know that there were more than 76 million \u201cengagements\u201d with content from the Russian group \u2014 likes, comments, shares and clicks \u2014 but it is not currently possible to know how many came from real people. \u201cSince Facebook did not provide data about any sock-puppet accounts involved in the distribution of the content or the existence of \u2018fake Likes\u2019 from these accounts,\u201d one report says, \u201cwe are operating under the assumption that this engagement was from real people and that this content was pushed into the News Feeds of their Friends as well.\u201d\\r\\n<p>Those are two enormous leaps. We do not currently know for sure whether these engagements were carried out by humans or bots or a mixture of the two, so the researchers were left to assume the worst. It\u2019s worth scanning other recent Facebook narratives for similar assumptions. Did Facebook cause the gilets jaunes protests in France? Is the movement \u201ca beast born almost entirely from Facebook,\u201d as a recent BuzzFeed piece suggested? Or are the protesters just using Facebook as they sustain a long tradition of civil unrest in France?\\r\\n<br>The latter theory is obscured by the basic difficulty of discerning why an individual feels a certain way, much less a diverse nation of millions. The former, however, feels as though it has been hidden from us, because Facebook should, in theory, be able to shed light on this question. Its users live in a state of full surveillance, with them and everything around them subject to near-total tracking. The company is at least capable of knowing how a piece of content found its way from one user to thousands or how a gilets jaunes group functions on the social platform. Far more than any outside researchers, Facebook is capable of answering questions about the Internet Research Agency in 2016: For example, how many of the accounts that interacted with the group\u2019s posts went on to interact with other political content? Was the audience for these posts even real in the first place or part of the operation itself? (Both reports criticized tech companies for doing the bare minimum to assist in the committee\u2019s efforts.)\\r\\n<p>The biggest internet platforms are businesses built on asymmetric information. They know far more about their advertising, labor and commerce marketplaces than do any of the parties participating in them. We can guess, but can\u2019t know, why we were shown a friend\u2019s Facebook post about a divorce, instead of another\u2019s about a child\u2019s birth. We can theorize, but won\u2019t be told, why YouTube thinks we want to see a right-wing polemic about Islam in Europe after watching a video about travel destinations in France. Everything that takes place within the platform kingdoms is enabled by systems we\u2019re told must be kept private in order to function. We\u2019re living in worlds governed by trade secrets. No wonder they\u2019re making us all paranoid.\\r\\n<p>The original sin of our current tech hegemons is that in order to work, the rest of the world can\u2019t know how they work. How does Google trawl the web and produce search results? That\u2019s a secret that helped it become the dominant search engine and that sustains its business model. How does Facebook choose what comes next in your News Feed? How do YouTube recommendations work? Too much transparency, the defense goes, would expose them to reverse-engineering or abuse by bad actors.\\r\\n<br>The technologist Anil Dash recently described some of the internet\u2019s biggest platform businesses as \u201cfake markets.\u201d These are businesses that purport to be marketplaces, making money by connecting parties \u2014 people who want rides with drivers, advertisers with eyeballs \u2014 but are not actually markets in the strict sense of the word. They\u2019re centrally and often assertively managed and manipulated. Some hardly resemble markets at all. Dash singled out Uber: In that \u201cmarket,\u201d drivers don\u2019t set prices, consumers don\u2019t actually have much choice and resources are allocated by trade-secret algorithms. Our ignorance of how such things work is easier to ignore when a platform is establishing itself and sharing the benefits of its growth. This dynamic only starts to bother us after a platform wins, when there are fewer alternatives or none at all.\\r\\n<br>When platforms become entrenched and harder for users to leave, the secrets they keep are reflected back to them as resentments. On Facebook, where every user\u2019s experience is a mystery to all others \u2014 and where real-world concepts like privacy, obscurity and serendipity have been recreated on the terms of an advertising platform \u2014 users understandably imagine that anything could be happening around them: that their peers are being indoctrinated, tricked, sheltered or misled on a host of issues. These gaps in knowledge are magnified once a platform becomes involved in real-world events. Twitter is broadly understood to be a catalytic political force, but this understanding is usually half hunch \u2014 its relationship to the Arab Spring is still in dispute; its usefulness to Donald Trump will never be fully understood; and Twitter seems to be in no hurry to help figure it out. Similarly: Is YouTube reflecting a rise in reactionary politics, enabling it or creating it? These are already impossible questions to answer in full; that everything is unfolding inside of a closely guarded attention marketplace makes them difficult to even approach.\\r\\n<p>So, did Facebook cause the gilets jaunes uprising in France? Maybe, interesting theory; meanwhile, though, I don\u2019t even know why it\u2019s recommending I friend someone I\u2019ve never heard of. Did Facebook swing the 2016 election? Could have, as far as we know; anyway, I can\u2019t even guess why Instagram started showing me a bunch of photos of a certain breed of dog or why it\u2019s suddenly serving me ads for meal kits. I know how these things make me feel, but Facebook knows how they made me behave \u2014 knowledge it won\u2019t soon share.\\r\\n<p>It appears to be the tendency of the press, and of our imaginations in general, to extend these theories in a particular direction. After years of Facebook\u2019s telling us how good it is at connecting people and influencing their decisions, it is tempting to say something like: Yes, O.K., then wouldn\u2019t it have been easy to use these same tools to persuade people to vote for Donald Trump? Facebook has equivocated on this question in a telling way. It\u2019s helpful to imagine what it would have to say to successfully combat claims Russia used its platform to swing the election: Sure, this many users saw propaganda but only for a moment; and besides, this content didn\u2019t seem to affect their behavior in any way at all; sure, this amount of money was spent on ads, but those ads don\u2019t appear to have done anything; yes, these Instagram accounts had that many followers, but more than half of them were bots themselves; O.K., 76 million people were exposed to this content in some way or another, but they mostly glossed over it, like spam.\\r\\n<br>They\u2019ve inched tellingly in this direction but going all the way would involve unflattering disclosure \u2014 the sort that would need to be legally compelled. Mainly, it would be tantamount to admitting that the systems we\u2019re not allowed to know about \u2014 and the metrics we aren\u2019t allowed to see \u2014 might not be quite as valuable, or as worthy of trade secrecy, as Facebook needs us to think they are. While it\u2019s true that perceptions of the tech industry have shifted, they aren\u2019t necessarily closer to reality. These companies mythologized their own omniscience when it was a boon to their business. Versions of these myths persist, but they\u2019re no longer under their creator\u2019s control \u2014 and they\u2019re starting to bite back.\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"technology.3.txt\",\"id\":-1525035125},{\"title\":\"Mexico Pipeline Explosion Tests New President\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s response to a blast that killed dozens, many stealing fuel, has exposed a central tension between two of his policy vows: fighting crime and lifting the poor.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>MEXICO CITY \u2014 Word spread quickly: free gasoline.

Bottke, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., and one of the authors of a paper published in the journal Science. \u201cWe\u2019re changing the impact rate on the Earth by a factor of 2 to 3. That happened 290 million years ago.\u201d\\r\\n<br>[Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.]\\r\\n<br>That finding was unexpected, because there is no obvious explanation for why the number of asteroids or comets would jump. This period, which came before the rise of the dinosaurs, was long past the chaotic early days of the solar system.\\r\\n<br>Other scientists are skeptical, because the research draws its conclusions from only a small number of terrestrial and lunar craters. H. Jay Melosh, a Purdue University professor who is an expert on meteors and impacts, described the new paper as \u201can intriguing idea,\u201d but added that he was unconvinced. \\r\\n<br>\u201cWith statistics of small numbers, that doesn\u2019t give me confidence that they\u2019re right,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t say it\u2019s wrong, either. It\u2019s just not convincing.\u201d\\r\\n<p>The moon should offer some clues as to what happened on Earth. It is heavily cratered, recording thousands of impacts since it formed some 4.5 billion years ago. \\r\\n<p>But the age of any particular lunar crater has often been uncertain. Dating of radioactive elements in the moon rocks brought back by the Apollo astronauts nearly 50 years ago has pinned down the ages of about 10 craters, said Rebecca R. Ghent, a professor of earth sciences at the University of Toronto and an author of the new paper.\\r\\n<br>Another method used to date some craters is more imprecise. When a crater is new, its inside is usually smooth and pristine. Over time, smaller meteors strike the surface of this interior.\\r\\n<br>But no one knows the precise impact rate, and counting craters is not straightforward. One impact could scatter smaller rocks across the landscape, resulting in what wrongly appear to be separate, additional impacts. \u201cThen you\u2019re going to get the wrong age,\u201d Dr. Ghent said.\\r\\n<br>She came up with a novel, clever alternative: taking the temperature of a crater. \\r\\n<br>A fresh lunar crater tends to be surrounded by large boulders that were excavated by the meteor impact. The boulders retain heat when the crater rotates into darkness during the moon\u2019s nights, which last for two weeks at a time.\\r\\n<br>In older craters, the boulders, battered by micrometeorites for millions of years, turn to dust, which cools quickly at night. Dr. Bottke said anyone can observe this phenomenon with a walk on a beach at night: The sand is cool, while a rock in the sand is still warm.\\r\\n<br>A heat-measuring instrument on NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter was able to differentiate warm craters from cooler ones, and the pattern seemed to hold. A 53-mile-wide crater known as Tycho, known to be young, retained warmth during nighttime, while other craters known to be much older did not. \\r\\n<p>\u201cIt became very clear you could see the rocks in the nighttime data,\u201d said Dr. Ghent. \\r\\n<br>She and her colleagues calibrated the technique using the known ages of craters from the Apollo data. The correlation between the temperatures and the ages were \u201ca tight, tight fit,\u201d she said.\\r\\n<br>The team then looked at 111 moon craters that were more than six miles wide and less than a billion years old. What they found was that there were fewer older craters. The data suggested that the rate of impacts on the moon increased 290 million years ago.\\r\\n<br>\u201cI was surprised,\u201d Dr. Ghent said.\\r\\n<br>This is not the first time that scientists have suggested an uptick in lunar impacts. In 2000, scientists at University of California, Berkeley, came to a similar conclusion based on the dating of glass spheres embedded in the Apollo moon soil. The spheres formed when rocks melted then cooled after an impact.\\r\\n<br>\u201cTheir conclusions are broadly consistent with ours,\u201d Paul R. Renne, director of the Berkeley Geochronology Center, who was an author of the earlier paper, wrote in an email. \\r\\n<p>Since our planet and the moon are close to each other, \u201cWe should be able to see the same pattern with the Earth,\u201d said Sara Mazrouei of the University of Toronto, lead author of the new Science paper. \\r\\n<br>Indeed, with the method they used to date the lunar craters, the scientists found a lower rate of impacts on our planet before 300 million years ago, and almost no craters older than 650 million years. \\r\\n<br>The absence of older craters might be explained by what geologists describe as the \u201cSnowball Earth\u201d period, when ice covered almost the entire planet. The glaciers would have scoured the surface smooth.\\r\\n<p>Just looking at the older parts of Earth\u2019s surface, the researchers found fewer craters than would be expected if the rate of impact then were the same as it is now.\\r\\n<br>To argue against erosion erasing the craters, the researchers pointed to geological features known as kimberlite pipes \u2014 carrot-shaped rock formations that form during explosive eruptions. They found only a modest amount of erosion in the kimberlites over 650 million years, and they argue that impact craters also would not have eroded much.\\r\\n<br>The scientists speculate that perhaps the breakup of an asteroid could have generated a slew of new space rocks that rained down in the inner solar system. \\r\\n<br>The European Space Agency\u2019s BepiColombo spacecraft, which will arrive at the planet Mercury in 2025, carries a similar temperature-measuring instrument, and that could tell whether there was a jump in all the pummeling at the same time there.\\r\\n<br>Dr. Melosh said a conclusive answer will likely come from the moon, but not for a while. \u201cAll these problems would be solved if we could just get to the moon and date 10,000 craters,\u201d he said.\\r\\n<p>\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"science.4.txt\",\"id\":-782052188},{\"title\":\"Trilobites: Romeo the Frog Finds His Juliet.

It does not mean it is a company, a corporation, partnership, or have any such formal organization, but it can range from a street peddler to General Motors.\\\"[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving a business name does not separate the business entity from the owner, which means that the owner of the business is responsible and liable for all debts incurred by the business. If the business acquires debts, the creditors can go after the owner's personal possessions. A business structure does not allow for corporate tax rates. The proprietor is personally taxed on all income from the business.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term is also often used colloquially (but not by lawyers or by public officials) to refer to a company. A company, on the other hand, is a separate legal entity and provides for limited liability, as well as corporate tax rates. A company structure is more complicated and expensive to set up, but offers more protection and benefits for the owner.\\r\\n\\r\\nForms\\r\\nMain article: List of business entities\\r\\nForms of business ownership vary by jurisdiction, but several common entities exist:\\r\\n\\r\\nSole proprietorship: A sole proprietorship, also known as a sole trader, is owned by one person and operates for their benefit. The owner operates the business alone and may hire employees. A sole proprietor has unlimited liability for all obligations incurred by the business, whether from operating costs or judgments against the business. All assets of the business belong to a sole proprietor, including, for example, computer infrastructure, any inventory, manufacturing equipment, or retail fixtures, as well as any real property owned by the sole proprietor.\\r\\nPartnership: A partnership is a business owned by two or more people. In most forms of partnerships, each partner has unlimited liability for the debts incurred by the business. The three most prevalent types of for-profit partnerships are: general partnerships, limited partnerships, and limited liability partnerships.[6]\\r\\nCorporation: The owners of a corporation have limited liability and the business has a separate legal personality from its owners. Corporations can be either government-owned or privately owned. They can organize either for profit or as nonprofit organizations. A privately owned, for-profit corporation is owned by its shareholders, who elect a board of directors to direct the corporation and hire its managerial staff. A privately owned, for-profit corporation can be either privately held by a small group of individuals, or publicly held, with publicly traded shares listed on a stock exchange.\\r\\nCooperative: Often referred to as a \\\"co-op\\\", a cooperative is a limited-liability business that can organize as for-profit or not-for-profit. A cooperative differs from a corporation in that it has members, not shareholders, and they share decision-making authority. Cooperatives are typically classified as either consumer cooperatives or worker cooperatives. Cooperatives are fundamental to the ideology of economic democracy.\\r\\nLimited liability companies (LLC), limited liability partnerships, and other specific types of business organization protect their owners or shareholders from business failure by doing business under a separate legal entity with certain legal protections. In contrast, unincorporated businesses or persons working on their own are usually not as protected.[7][8]\\r\\nFranchises: A franchise is a system in which entrepreneurs purchase the rights to open and run a business from a larger corporation.[9] Franchising in the United States is widespread and is a major economic powerhouse. One out of twelve retail businesses in the United States are franchised and 8 million people are employed in a franchised business.[10]\\r\\nA company limited by guarantee: Commonly used where companies are formed for noncommercial purposes, such as clubs or charities. The members guarantee the payment of certain (usually nominal) amounts if the company goes into insolvent liquidation, but otherwise, they have no economic rights in relation to the company. This type of company is common in England. A company limited by guarantee may be with or without having share capital.\\r\\nA company limited by shares: The most common form of the company used for business ventures. Specifically, a limited company is a \\\"company in which the liability of each shareholder is limited to the amount individually invested\\\" with corporations being \\\"the most common example of a limited company.\\\"[11] This type of company is common in England and many English-speaking countries. A company limited by shares may be a\\r\\npublicly traded company or a\\r\\nprivately held company\\r\\nA company limited by guarantee with a share capital: A hybrid entity, usually used where the company is formed for noncommercial purposes, but the activities of the company are partly funded by investors who expect a return. This type of company may no longer be formed in the UK, although provisions still exist in law for them to exist.[12]\\r\\nA limited liability company: \\\"A company\ufffdstatutorily authorized in certain states\ufffdthat is characterized by limited liability, management by members or managers, and limitations on ownership transfer\\\", i.e., L.L.C.[11] LLC structure has been called \\\"hybrid\\\" in that it \\\"combines the characteristics of a corporation and of a partnership or sole proprietorship\\\". Like a corporation, it has limited liability for members of the company, and like a partnership it has \\\"flow-through taxation to the members\\\" and must be \\\"dissolved upon the death or bankruptcy of a member\\\".[13]\\r\\nAn unlimited company with or without a share capital: A hybrid entity, a company where the liability of members or shareholders for the debts (if any) of the company are not limited. In this case doctrine of a veil of incorporation does not apply.\\r\\nLess common types of companies are:\\r\\n\\r\\nCompanies formed by letters patent: Most corporations by letters patent are corporations sole and not companies as the term is commonly understood today.\\r\\nCharter corporations: Before the passing of modern companies legislation, these were the only types of companies. Now they are relatively rare, except for very old companies that still survive (of which there are still many, particularly many British banks), or modern societies that fulfill a quasi-regulatory function (for example, the Bank of England is a corporation formed by a modern charter).\\r\\nStatutory companies: Relatively rare today, certain companies have been formed by a private statute passed in the relevant jurisdiction.\\r\\nNote that \\\"Ltd after the company's name signifies limited company, and PLC (public limited company) indicates that its shares are widely held.\\\"[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn legal parlance, the owners of a company are normally referred to as the \\\"members\\\". In a company limited or unlimited by shares (formed or incorporated with a share capital), this will be the shareholders. In a company limited by guarantee, this will be the guarantors. Some offshore jurisdictions have created special forms of offshore company in a bid to attract business for their jurisdictions. Examples include \\\"segregated portfolio companies\\\" and restricted purpose companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are, however, many, many sub-categories of types of company that can be formed in various jurisdictions in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompanies are also sometimes distinguished for legal and regulatory purposes between public companies and private companies. Public companies are companies whose shares can be publicly traded, often (although not always) on a stock exchange which imposes listing requirements\/Listing Rules as to the issued shares, the trading of shares and future issue of shares to help bolster the reputation of the exchange or particular market of an exchange. Private companies do not have publicly traded shares, and often contain restrictions on transfers of shares. In some jurisdictions, private companies have maximum numbers of shareholders.\\r\\n\\r\\nA parent company is a company that owns enough voting stock in another firm to control management and operations by influencing or electing its board of directors; the second company being deemed as a subsidiary of the parent company. The definition of a parent company differs by jurisdiction, with the definition normally being defined by way of laws dealing with companies in that jurisdiction.\\r\\n\\r\\nClassifications\\r\\nMain article: Industry classification\\r\\nAgriculture, such as the domestication of fish, animals and livestock, as well as lumber, oil and mining businesses that extract natural resources and raw materials, such as wood, petroleum, natural gas, ores, plants or minerals.\\r\\nFinancial services businesses include banks, brokerage firms, credit unions, credit cards, insurance companies, asset and investment companies such as private equity firms, private equity funds, real estate investment trusts, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, mutual funds, index funds, and hedge funds, stock exchanges, and other companies that generate profits through investment and management of capital.\\r\\nEntertainment companies and mass media agencies generate profits primarily from the sale of intellectual property. They include film studios and production houses, mass media companies such as cable television networks, online digital media agencies, talent agencies, mobile media outlets, newspapers, book and magazine publishing houses.\\r\\nIndustrial manufacturers produce products, either from raw materials or from component parts, then export the finished products at a profit. They include tangible goods such as cars, buses, medical devices, glass, or aircraft.\\r\\nReal estate businesses sell, invest, construct and develop properties, including land, residential homes, and other buildings.\\r\\nRetailers, wholesalers, and distributors act as middlemen and get goods produced by manufacturers to the intended consumers; they make their profits by marking up their prices. Most stores and catalog companies are distributors or retailers.\\r\\nTransportation businesses such as railways, airlines, shipping companies that deliver goods and individuals to their destinations for a fee.\\r\\nUtilities produce public services such as water, electricity, waste management or sewage treatment. These industries are usually operated under the charge of a public government.\\r\\nService businesses offer intangible goods or services and typically charge for labor or other services provided to government, to consumers, or to other businesses. Interior decorators, beauticians, hairstylists, make-up artists, tanning salons, laundromats, dry cleaners, and pest controllers are service businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nActivities\\r\\nAccounting\\r\\nMain article: Accounting\\r\\nAccounting is the measurement, processing and communication of financial information about economic entities[15][16] such as businesses and corporations. The modern field was established by the Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli in 1494.[17] Accounting, which has been called the \\\"language of business\\\",[18] measures the results of an organization's economic activities and conveys this information to a variety of users, including investors, creditors, management, and regulators.[19] Practitioners of accounting are known as accountants. The terms \\\"accounting\\\" and \\\"financial reporting\\\" are often used as synonyms.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinance\\r\\nMain article: Finance\\r\\nFinance is a field that deals with the study of investments. It includes the dynamics of assets and liabilities over time under conditions of different degrees of uncertainty and risk. Finance can also be defined as the science of money management. Finance aims to price assets based on their risk level and their expected rate of return. Finance can be broken into three different sub-categories: public finance, corporate finance and personal finance.\\r\\n\\r\\nManufacturing\\r\\nMain article: Manufacturing\\r\\nManufacturing is the production of merchandise for use or sale using labour and machines, tools, chemical and biological processing, or formulation. The term may refer to a range of human activity, from handicraft to high tech, but is most commonly applied to industrial production, in which raw materials are transformed into finished goods on a large scale.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarketing\\r\\nMain article: Marketing\\r\\nMarketing is defined by the American Marketing Association as \\\"the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.\\\"[20] The term developed from the original meaning which referred literally to going to a market to buy or sell goods or services. Marketing tactics include advertising as well as determining product pricing.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the rise in technology, marketing is further divided into a class called digital marketing. It is marketing products and services using digital technologies.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch and development\\r\\nMain article: Research and development\\r\\nResearch and development refer to activities in connection with corporate or government innovation. Research and development constitute the first stage of development of a potential new service or product. Research and development are very difficult to manage since the defining feature of the research is that the researchers do not know in advance exactly how to accomplish the desired result.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSafety\\r\\nMain article: Safety\\r\\nSafety is a key business concept that is defined by Merriam-Webster as \ufffdthe condition of being safe from undergoing or causing hurt, injury, or loss\ufffd.[21] Injuries cost businesses billions of dollars annually.[22] Studies have shown how company acceptance and implementation of comprehensive safety and health management systems reduces incidents, insurance costs and workers\ufffd compensation claims.[23] New technologies, like wearable safety devices[24] and available online safety training, continue to be developed to encourage employers to invest in protection beyond the \\\"canary in the coalmine\\\" and reduce the cost to businesses of protecting their employees.\\r\\n\\r\\nSales\\r\\nMain article: Sales\\r\\nSales are activity related to selling or the amount of goods or services sold in a given time period. Sales are often integrated with all lines of business and are key to a companies' success.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganization and regulation\\r\\nSee also: Theory of the firm\\r\\nMost legal jurisdictions specify the forms of ownership that a business can take, creating a body of commercial law for each type.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major factors affecting how a business is organized are usually:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe size and scope of the business firm and its structure, management, and ownership, broadly analyzed in the theory of the firm. Generally, a smaller business is more flexible, while larger businesses, or those with wider ownership or more formal structures, will usually tend to be organized as corporations or (less often) partnerships. In addition, a business that wishes to raise money on a stock market or to be owned by a wide range of people will often be required to adopt a specific legal form to do so.\\r\\nThe sector and country. Private profit-making businesses are different from government-owned bodies. In some countries, certain businesses are legally obliged to be organized in certain ways.\\r\\nTax advantages. Different structures are treated differently in tax law and may have advantages for this reason.\\r\\nDisclosure and compliance requirements. Different business structures may be required to make less or more information public (or report it to relevant authorities) and may be bound to comply with different rules and regulations.\\r\\nMany businesses are operated through a separate entity such as a corporation or a partnership (either formed with or without limited liability). Most legal jurisdictions allow people to organize such an entity by filing certain charter documents with the relevant Secretary of State or equivalent and complying with certain other ongoing obligations. The relationships and legal rights of shareholders, limited partners, or members are governed partly by the charter documents and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the entity is organized. Generally speaking, shareholders in a corporation, limited partners in a limited partnership, and members in a limited liability company are shielded from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the entity, which is legally treated as a separate \\\"person\\\". This means that unless there is misconduct, the owner's own possessions are strongly protected in law if the business does not succeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere two or more individuals own a business together but have failed to organize a more specialized form of vehicle, they will be treated as a general partnership. The terms of a partnership are partly governed by a partnership agreement if one is created, and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. No paperwork or filing is necessary to create a partnership, and without an agreement, the relationships and legal rights of the partners will be entirely governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. A single person who owns and runs a business is commonly known as a sole proprietor, whether that person owns it directly or through a formally organized entity. Depending on the business needs, an adviser can decide what kind is proprietorship will be most suitable.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few relevant factors to consider in deciding how to operate a business include:\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral partners in a partnership (other than a limited liability partnership), plus anyone who personally owns and operates a business without creating a separate legal entity, are personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business.\\r\\nGenerally, corporations are required to pay tax just like \\\"real\\\" people. In some tax systems, this can give rise to so-called double taxation, because first the corporation pays tax on the profit, and then when the corporation distributes its profits to its owners, individuals have to include dividends in their income when they complete their personal tax returns, at which point a second layer of income tax is imposed.\\r\\nIn most countries, there are laws which treat small corporations differently from large ones. They may be exempt from certain legal filing requirements or labor laws, have simplified procedures in specialized areas, and have simplified, advantageous, or slightly different tax treatment.\\r\\n\\\"Going public\\\" through a process known as an initial public offering (IPO) means that part of the business will be owned by members of the public. This requires the organization as a distinct entity, to disclose information to the public, and adhering to a tighter set of laws and procedures. Most public entities are corporations that have sold shares, but increasingly there are also public LLC's that sell units (sometimes also called shares), and other more exotic entities as well, such as, for example, real estate investment trusts in the USA, and unit trusts in the UK. A general partnership cannot \\\"go public\\\".\\r\\nCommercial law\\r\\nMain article: Corporate law\\r\\n\\r\\nOffices in the Los Angeles Downtown Financial District\\r\\nA very detailed and well-established body of rules that evolved over a very long period of time applies to commercial transactions. The need to regulate trade and commerce and resolve business disputes helped shape the creation of law and courts. The Code of Hammurabi dates back to about 1772 BC for example, and contains provisions that relate, among other matters, to shipping costs and dealings between merchants and brokers.[27] The word \\\"corporation\\\" derives from the Latin corpus, meaning body, and the Maurya Empire in Iron-Age India accorded legal rights to business entities.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many countries, it is difficult to compile all the laws that can affect a business into a single reference source. Laws can govern treatment of labour and employee relations, worker protection and safety, discrimination on the basis of age, gender, disability, race, and in some jurisdictions, sexual orientation, and the minimum wage, as well as unions, worker compensation, and working hours and leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome specialized businesses may also require licenses, either due to laws governing entry into certain trades, occupations or professions, that require special education or to raise revenue for local governments. Professions that require special licenses include law, medicine, piloting aircraft, selling liquor, radio broadcasting, selling investment securities, selling used cars, and roofing. Local jurisdictions may also require special licenses and taxes just to operate a business.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome businesses are subject to ongoing special regulation, for example, public utilities, investment securities, banking, insurance, broadcasting, aviation, and health care providers. Environmental regulations are also very complex and can affect many businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nCapital\\r\\n\\r\\nMexican Stock Exchange in Paseo de la Reforma, Mexico City\\r\\nWhen businesses need to raise money (called capital), they sometimes offer securities for sale.\\r\\n\\r\\nCapital may be raised through private means, by an initial public offering or IPO on a stock exchange, or in other ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor stock exchanges include the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Singapore Exchange, Hong Kong Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ (the USA), the London Stock Exchange (UK), the Tokyo Stock Exchange (Japan), and Bombay Stock Exchange (India). Most countries with capital markets have at least one.\\r\\n\\r\\nBusinesses that have gone public are subject to regulations concerning their internal governance, such as how executive officers' compensation is determined, and when and how information is disclosed to shareholders and to the public. In the United States, these regulations are primarily implemented and enforced by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Other western nations have comparable regulatory bodies. The regulations are implemented and enforced by the China Securities Regulation Commission (CSRC) in China. In Singapore, the regulatory authority is the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and in Hong Kong, it is the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proliferation and increasing complexity of the laws governing business have forced increasing specialization in corporate law. It is not unheard of for certain kinds of corporate transactions to require a team of five to ten attorneys due to sprawling regulation. Commercial law spans general corporate law, employment and labor law, health-care law, securities law, mergers and acquisitions, tax law, employee benefit plans, food and drug regulation, intellectual property law on copyrights, patents, trademarks, telecommunications law, and financing.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther types of capital sourcing include crowdsourcing on the Internet, venture capital, bank loans, and debentures.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntellectual property\\r\\nMain article: Intellectual property\\r\\nBusinesses often have important \\\"intellectual property\\\" that needs protection from competitors for the company to stay profitable. This could require patents, copyrights, trademarks, or preservation of trade secrets. Most businesses have names, logos, and similar branding techniques that could benefit from trademarking. Patents and copyrights in the United States are largely governed by federal law, while trade secrets and trademarking are mostly a matter of state law. Because of the nature of intellectual property, a business needs protection in every jurisdiction in which they are concerned about competitors. Many countries are signatories to international treaties concerning intellectual property, and thus companies registered in these countries are subject to national laws bound by these treaties. In order to protect trade secrets, companies may require employees to sign noncompete clauses which will impose limitations on an employee's interactions with stakeholders, and competitors.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrade union\\r\\nMain article: Trade union\\r\\nA trade union (or labor union) is an organization of workers who have come together to achieve common goals such as protecting the integrity of its trade, improving safety standards, achieving higher pay and benefits such as health care and retirement, increasing the number of employees an employer assigns to complete the work, and better working conditions. The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members (rank and file members) and negotiates labor contracts (collective bargaining) with employers. The most common purpose of these associations or unions is \\\"maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment\\\".[29] This may include the negotiation of wages, work rules, complaint procedures, rules governing hiring, firing, and promotion of workers, benefits, workplace safety and policies.\",\"evals\":[],\"id\":643957705},{\"title\":\"health\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"See also: Social determinants of health and Risk factor\\rGenerally, the context in which an individual lives is of great importance for both his health status and quality of their life[18].

It is increasingly recognized that health is maintained and improved not only through the advancement and application of health science, but also through the efforts and intelligent lifestyle choices of the individual and society. According to the World Health Organization, the main determinants of health include the social and economic environment, the physical environment and the person's individual characteristics and behaviors.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nMore specifically, key factors that have been found to influence whether people are healthy or unhealthy include the following:[19][20][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIncome and social status\\r\\nSocial support networks\\r\\nEducation and literacy\\r\\nEmployment\/working conditions\\r\\nSocial environments\\r\\nPhysical environments\\r\\nPersonal health practices and coping skills\\r\\nHealthy child development\\r\\nBiology and genetics\\r\\nHealth care services\\r\\nGender\\r\\nCulture\\r\\n\\r\\nDonald Henderson as part of the CDC's smallpox eradication team in 1966.\\r\\nAn increasing number of studies and reports from different organizations and contexts examine the linkages between health and different factors, including lifestyles, environments, health care organization and health policy, one specific health policy brought into many countries in recent years was the introduction of the sugar tax. Beverage taxes came into light with increasing concerns about obesity, particularly among youth. Sugar-sweetened beverages have become a target of anti-obesity initiatives with increasing evidence of their link to obesity.[22]\ufffd such as the 1974 Lalonde report from Canada;[21] the Alameda County Study in California;[23] and the series of World Health Reports of the World Health Organization, which focuses on global health issues including access to health care and improving public health outcomes, especially in developing countries.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe concept of the \\\"health field,\\\" as distinct from medical care, emerged from the Lalonde report from Canada. The report identified three interdependent fields as key determinants of an individual's health. These are:[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nLifestyle: the aggregation of personal decisions (i.e., over which the individual has control) that can be said to contribute to, or cause, illness or death;\\r\\nEnvironmental: all matters related to health external to the human body and over which the individual has little or no control;\\r\\nBiomedical: all aspects of health, physical and mental, developed within the human body as influenced by genetic make-up.\\r\\nThe maintenance and promotion of health is achieved through different combination of physical, mental, and social well-being, together sometimes referred to as the \\\"health triangle.\\\"[25][26] The WHO's 1986 Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion further stated that health is not just a state, but also \\\"a resource for everyday life, not the objective of living. Health is a positive concept emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities.\\\"[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nFocusing more on lifestyle issues and their relationships with functional health, data from the Alameda County Study suggested that people can improve their health via exercise, enough sleep, maintaining a healthy body weight, limiting alcohol use, and avoiding smoking.[28] Health and illness can co-exist, as even people with multiple chronic diseases or terminal illnesses can consider themselves healthy.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe environment is often cited as an important factor influencing the health status of individuals. This includes characteristics of the natural environment, the built environment and the social environment. Factors such as clean water and air, adequate housing, and safe communities and roads all have been found to contribute to good health, especially to the health of infants and children.[19][30] Some studies have shown that a lack of neighborhood recreational spaces including natural environment leads to lower levels of personal satisfaction and higher levels of obesity, linked to lower overall health and well being.[31] This suggests that the positive health benefits of natural space in urban neighborhoods should be taken into account in public policy and land use.\\r\\n\\r\\nGenetics, or inherited traits from parents, also play a role in determining the health status of individuals and populations. This can encompass both the predisposition to certain diseases and health conditions, as well as the habits and behaviors individuals develop through the lifestyle of their families. For example, genetics may play a role in the manner in which people cope with stress, either mental, emotional or physical. For example, obesity is a significant problem in the United States that contributes to bad mental health and causes stress in the lives of great numbers of people[32]. (One difficulty is the issue raised by the debate over the relative strengths of genetics and other factors; interactions between genetics and environment may be of particular importance.)\\r\\n\\r\\nPotential issues\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of types of health issues are common around the globe. Disease is one of the most common. According to GlobalIssues.org, approximately 36 million people die each year from non-communicable (not contagious) disease including cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic lung disease (Shah, 2014).\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong communicable diseases, both viral and bacterial, AIDS\/HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria are the most common, causing millions of deaths every year (Shah, 2014).\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother health issue that causes death or contributes to other health problems is malnutrition, especially among children. One of the groups malnutrition affects most is young children. Approximately 7.5 million children under the age of 5 die from malnutrition, usually brought on by not having the money to find or make food (Shah, 2014).\\r\\n\\r\\nBodily injuries are also a common health issue worldwide. These injuries, including broken bones, fractures, and burns can reduce a person's quality of life or can cause fatalities including infections that resulted from the injury or the severity injury in general (Moffett, 2013).[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nLifestyle choices are contributing factors to poor health in many cases. These include smoking cigarettes, and can also include a poor diet, whether it is overeating or an overly constrictive diet. Inactivity can also contribute to health issues and also a lack of sleep, excessive alcohol consumption, and neglect of oral hygiene (Moffett2013).There are also genetic disorders that are inherited by the person and can vary in how much they affect the person and when they surface (Moffett, 2013).\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the majority of these health issues are preventable, a major contributor to global ill health is the fact that approximately 1 billion people lack access to health care systems (Shah, 2014). Arguably, the most common and harmful health issue is that a great many people do not have access to quality remedies.[34][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nMental health\\r\\nMain article: Mental health\\r\\nThe World Health Organization describes mental health as \\\"a state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community\\\".[36] Mental Health is not just the absence of mental illness.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nMental illness is described as 'the spectrum of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral conditions that interfere with social and emotional well-being and the lives and productivity of people. Having a mental illness can seriously impair, temporarily or permanently, the mental functioning of a person. Other terms include: 'mental health problem', 'illness', 'disorder', 'dysfunction'.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nRoughly a quarter of all adults 18 and over in the US are considered diagnosable with mental illness. Mental illnesses are the leading cause of disability in the US and Canada. Examples include, schizophrenia, ADHD, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and autism.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany teens suffer from mental health issues in response to the pressures of society and social problems they encounter. Some of the key mental health issues seen in teens are: depression, eating disorders, and drug abuse. There are many ways to prevent these health issues from occurring such as communicating well with a teen suffering from mental health issues. Mental health can be treated and be attentive to teens' behavior.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\n Many factors contribute to mental health problems, including:\\r\\n\\r\\nBiological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry\\r\\nLife experiences, such as trauma or abuse\\r\\nFamily history of mental health problems\\r\\nMaintaining\\r\\nAchieving and maintaining health is an ongoing process, shaped by both the evolution of health care knowledge and practices as well as personal strategies and organized interventions for staying healthy.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet\\r\\nMain articles: Healthy diet and Human nutrition\\r\\n\\r\\nPercentage of overweight or obese population in 2010, Data source: OECD's iLibrary, http:\/\/stats.oecd.org[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nPercentage of obese population in 2010, Data source: OECD's iLibrary, http:\/\/stats.oecd.org[42]\\r\\nAn important way to maintain your personal health is to have a healthy diet. A healthy diet includes a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods that provide nutrients to your body. Such nutrients give you energy and keep your body running. Nutrients help build and strengthen bones, muscles, and tendons and also regulate body processes (i.e. blood pressure). The food guide pyramid is a pyramid-shaped guide of healthy foods divided into sections. Each section shows the recommended intake for each food group (i.e. Protein, Fat, Carbohydrates, and Sugars). Making healthy food choices is important because it can lower your risk of heart disease, developing some types of cancer, and it will contribute to maintaining a healthy weight.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mediterranean diet is commonly associated with health-promoting effects due to the fact that it contains some bioactive compounds like phenolic compounds, isoprenoids and alkaloids.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nExercise\\r\\nMain article: Exercise\\r\\nPhysical exercise enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness. It strengthens muscles and improves the cardiovascular system. According to the National Institutes of Health, there are four types of exercise: endurance, strength, flexibility, and balance.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nSleep\\r\\nMain articles: Sleep and Sleep deprivation\\r\\nSleep is an essential component to maintaining health. In children, sleep is also vital for growth and development. Ongoing sleep deprivation has been linked to an increased risk for some chronic health problems. In addition, sleep deprivation has been shown to correlate with both increased susceptibility to illness and slower recovery times from illness.[46] In one study, people with chronic insufficient sleep, set as six hours of sleep a night or less, were found to be four times more likely to catch a cold compared to those who reported sleeping for seven hours or more a night.[47] Due to the role of sleep in regulating metabolism, insufficient sleep may also play a role in weight gain or, conversely, in impeding weight loss.[48] Additionally, in 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is the cancer research agency for the World Health Organization, declared that \\\"shiftwork that involves circadian disruption is probably carcinogenic to humans,\\\" speaking to the dangers of long-term nighttime work due to its intrusion on sleep.[49] In 2015, the National Sleep Foundation released updated recommendations for sleep duration requirements based on age and concluded that \\\"Individuals who habitually sleep outside the normal range may be exhibiting signs or symptoms of serious health problems or, if done volitionally, may be compromising their health and well-being.\\\"[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nRole of science\\r\\nMain articles: Health science and Health care\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dutch Public Health Service provides medical care for the natives of the Dutch East Indies, May 1946\\r\\nHealth science is the branch of science focused on health. There are two main approaches to health science: the study and research of the body and health-related issues to understand how humans (and animals) function, and the application of that knowledge to improve health and to prevent and cure diseases and other physical and mental impairments. The science builds on many sub-fields, including biology, biochemistry, physics, epidemiology, pharmacology, medical sociology. Applied health sciences endeavor to better understand and improve human health through applications in areas such as health education, biomedical engineering, biotechnology and public health.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganized interventions to improve health based on the principles and procedures developed through the health sciences are provided by practitioners trained in medicine, nursing, nutrition, pharmacy, social work, psychology, occupational therapy, physical therapy and other health care professions. Clinical practitioners focus mainly on the health of individuals, while public health practitioners consider the overall health of communities and populations. Workplace wellness programs are increasingly adopted by companies for their value in improving the health and well-being of their employees, as are school health services in order to improve the health and well-being of children.\\r\\n\\r\\nRole of public health\\r\\nMain article: Public health\\r\\nSee also: Global health\\r\\n\\r\\nPostage stamp, New Zealand, 1933. Public health has been promoted \ufffd and depicted \ufffd in a wide variety of ways.\\r\\nPublic health has been described as \\\"the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations, public and private, communities and individuals.\\\"[51] It is concerned with threats to the overall health of a community based on population health analysis. The population in question can be as small as a handful of people or as large as all the inhabitants of several continents (for instance, in the case of a pandemic). Public health has many sub-fields, but typically includes the interdisciplinary categories of epidemiology, biostatistics and health services. Environmental health, community health, behavioral health, and occupational health are also important areas of public health.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe focus of public health interventions is to prevent and manage diseases, injuries and other health conditions through surveillance of cases and the promotion of healthy behavior, communities, and (in aspects relevant to human health) environments. Its aim is to prevent health problems from happening or re-occurring by implementing educational programs, developing policies, administering services and conducting research.[52] In many cases, treating a disease or controlling a pathogen can be vital to preventing it in others, such as during an outbreak. Vaccination programs and distribution of condoms to prevent the spread of communicable diseases are examples of common preventive public health measures, as are educational campaigns to promote vaccination and the use of condoms (including overcoming resistance to such).\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic health also takes various actions to limit the health disparities between different areas of the country and, in some cases, the continent or world. One issue is the access of individuals and communities to health care in terms of financial, geographical or socio-cultural constraints to accessing and using services.[53] Applications of the public health system include the areas of maternal and child health, health services administration, emergency response, and prevention and control of infectious and chronic diseases.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great positive impact of public health programs is widely acknowledged. Due in part to the policies and actions developed through public health, the 20th century registered a decrease in the mortality rates for infants and children and a continual increase in life expectancy in most parts of the world. For example, it is estimated that life expectancy has increased for Americans by thirty years since 1900,[54] and worldwide by six years since 1990.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nSelf-care strategies\\r\\nMain article: Self care\\r\\nSee also: Chronic care management, Social relation, and Stress management\\r\\n\\r\\nA lady washing her hands c. 1655\\r\\nPersonal health depends partially on the active, passive, and assisted cues people observe and adopt about their own health. These include personal actions for preventing or minimizing the effects of a disease, usually a chronic condition, through integrative care. They also include personal hygiene practices to prevent infection and illness, such as bathing and washing hands with soap; brushing and flossing teeth; storing, preparing and handling food safely; and many others. The information gleaned from personal observations of daily living \ufffd such as about sleep patterns, exercise behavior, nutritional intake and environmental features \ufffd may be used to inform personal decisions and actions (e.g., \\\"I feel tired in the morning so I am going to try sleeping on a different pillow\\\"), as well as clinical decisions and treatment plans (e.g., a patient who notices his or her shoes are tighter than usual may be having exacerbation of left-sided heart failure, and may require diuretic medication to reduce fluid overload).[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonal health also depends partially on the social structure of a person's life. The maintenance of strong social relationships, volunteering, and other social activities have been linked to positive mental health and also increased longevity. One American study among seniors over age 70, found that frequent volunteering was associated with reduced risk of dying compared with older persons who did not volunteer, regardless of physical health status.[57] Another study from Singapore reported that volunteering retirees had significantly better cognitive performance scores, fewer depressive symptoms, and better mental well-being and life satisfaction than non-volunteering retirees.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nProlonged psychological stress may negatively impact health, and has been cited as a factor in cognitive impairment with aging, depressive illness, and expression of disease.[59] Stress management is the application of methods to either reduce stress or increase tolerance to stress. Relaxation techniques are physical methods used to relieve stress. Psychological methods include cognitive therapy, meditation, and positive thinking, which work by reducing response to stress. Improving relevant skills, such as problem solving and time management skills, reduces uncertainty and builds confidence, which also reduces the reaction to stress-causing situations where those skills are applicable.\\r\\n\\r\\nOccupational\\r\\nMain article: Occupational safety and health\\r\\nIn addition to safety risks, many jobs also present risks of disease, illness and other long-term health problems. Among the most common occupational diseases are various forms of pneumoconiosis, including silicosis and coal worker's pneumoconiosis (black lung disease). Asthma is another respiratory illness that many workers are vulnerable to. Workers may also be vulnerable to skin diseases, including eczema, dermatitis, urticaria, sunburn, and skin cancer.[60][61] Other occupational diseases of concern include carpal tunnel syndrome and lead poisoning.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the number of service sector jobs has risen in developed countries, more and more jobs have become sedentary, presenting a different array of health problems than those associated with manufacturing and the primary sector. Contemporary problems, such as the growing rate of obesity and issues relating to stress and overwork in many countries, have further complicated the interaction between work and health.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany governments view occupational health as a social challenge and have formed public organizations to ensure the health and safety of workers. Examples of these include the British Health and Safety Executive and in the United States, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which conducts research on occupational health and safety, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which handles regulation and policy relating to worker safety and health.[62][63][64]\",\"evals\":[],\"id\":-1897987410},{\"title\":\"science\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"The earliest roots of science can be traced to Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3500 to 3000 BCE.[3][4] Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal ...\",\"content\":\"Science (from Latin scientia, meaning \\\"knowledge\\\")[1] is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.[2][a]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest roots of science can be traced to Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3500 to 3000 BCE.[3][4] Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to explain events of the physical world based on natural causes.[3][4] After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, knowledge of Greek conceptions of the world deteriorated in Western Europe during the early centuries (400 to 1000 CE) of the Middle Ages[5] but was preserved in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age.[6] The recovery and assimilation of Greek works and Islamic inquiries into Western Europe from the 10th to 13th century revived natural philosophy,[5][7] which was later transformed by the Scientific Revolution that began in the 16th century[8] as new ideas and discoveries departed from previous Greek conceptions and traditions.[9][10][11][12] The scientific method soon played a greater role in knowledge creation and it was not until the 19th century that many of the institutional and professional features of science began to take shape.[13][14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nModern science is typically divided into three major branches that consist of the natural sciences (e.g., biology, chemistry, and physics), which study nature in the broadest sense; the social sciences (e.g., economics, psychology, and sociology), which study individuals and societies; and the formal sciences (e.g., logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science), which study abstract concepts. There is disagreement,[16][17] however, on whether the formal sciences actually constitute a science as they do not rely on empirical evidence.[18] Disciplines that utilize existing scientific knowledge for practical purposes, such as engineering and medicine, are described as applied sciences.[19][20][21][22]\\r\\n\\r\\nScience is based on research, which is commonly conducted in academic and research institutions as well as in government agencies and companies. The practical impact of scientific research has led to the emergence of science policies that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by prioritizing the development of commercial products, armaments, health care, and environmental protection.\\r\\n\\r\\nBranches of science\\r\\nMain article: Branches of science\\r\\nModern science is commonly divided into three major branches that consist of the natural sciences, social sciences, and formal sciences. Each of these branches comprise various specialized yet overlapping scientific disciplines that often possess their own nomenclature and expertise.[88] Both natural and social sciences are empirical sciences[89] as their knowledge are based on empirical observations and are capable of being tested for its validity by other researchers working under the same conditions.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also closely related disciplines that use science, such as engineering and medicine.\\r\\n\\r\\nNatural science\\r\\nMain articles: Natural science and Outline of natural science\\r\\n\\r\\nFalse-color composite of global oceanic and terrestrial photoautotroph abundance by the SeaWiFS Project, NASA\/Goddard Space Flight Center, and ORBIMAGE.\\r\\nNatural science is concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of natural phenomena based on empirical evidence from observation and experimentation. It can be divided into two main branches: life science (or biological science) and physical science. Physical science is subdivided into branches, including physics, chemistry, astronomy and earth science. These two branches may be further divided into more specialized disciplines. Modern natural science is the successor to the natural philosophy that began in Ancient Greece. Galileo, Descartes, Bacon, and Newton debated the benefits of using approaches which were more mathematical and more experimental in a methodical way. Still, philosophical perspectives, conjectures, and presuppositions, often overlooked, remain necessary in natural science.[91] Systematic data collection, including discovery science, succeeded natural history, which emerged in the 16th century by describing and classifying plants, animals, minerals, and so on.[92] Today, \\\"natural history\\\" suggests observational descriptions aimed at popular audiences.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nSocial science\\r\\nMain articles: Social science and Outline of social science\\r\\n\\r\\nIn economics, the supply and demand model describes how prices vary as a result of a balance between product availability and demand.\\r\\nSocial science is concerned with society and the relationships among individuals within a society. It has many branches that include, but are not limited to, anthropology, archaeology, communication studies, economics, history, human geography, jurisprudence, linguistics, political science, psychology, public health, and sociology. Social scientists may adopt various philosophical theories to study individuals and society. For example, positivist social scientists use methods resembling those of the natural sciences as tools for understanding society, and so define science in its stricter modern sense. Interpretivist social scientists, by contrast, may use social critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing empirically falsifiable theories, and thus treat science in its broader sense. In modern academic practice, researchers are often eclectic, using multiple methodologies (for instance, by combining both quantitative and qualitative research). The term \\\"social research\\\" has also acquired a degree of autonomy as practitioners from various disciplines share in its aims and methods.\\r\\n\\r\\nFormal science\\r\\nMain articles: Formal science and Outline of formal science\\r\\n\\r\\nA humanoid robotic hand (see Shadow Hand system).\\r\\nFormal science is involved in the study of formal systems. It includes mathematics,[94][95] systems theory, robotics, and theoretical computer science. The formal sciences share similarities with the other two branches by relying on objective, careful, and systematic study of an area of knowledge. They are, however, different from the empirical sciences as they rely exclusively on deductive reasoning, without the need for empirical evidence, to verify their abstract concepts.[18][96][97] The formal sciences are therefore a priori disciplines and because of this, there is disagreement on whether they actually constitute a science.[16][17] Nevertheless, the formal sciences play an important role in the empirical sciences. Calculus, for example, was initially invented to understand motion in physics.[98] Natural and social sciences that rely heavily on mathematical applications include mathematical physics, mathematical chemistry, mathematical biology, mathematical finance, and mathematical economics.\\r\\n\\r\\nScientific research\\r\\nSee also: Research\\r\\nScientific research can be labeled as either basic or applied research. Basic research is the search for knowledge and applied research is the search for solutions to practical problems using this knowledge. Although some scientific research is applied research into specific problems, a great deal of our understanding comes from the curiosity-driven undertaking of basic research. This leads to options for technological advance that were not planned or sometimes even imaginable. This point was made by Michael Faraday when allegedly in response to the question \\\"what is the use of basic research?\\\" he responded: \\\"Sir, what is the use of a new-born child?\\\".[99] For example, research into the effects of red light on the human eye's rod cells did not seem to have any practical purpose; eventually, the discovery that our night vision is not troubled by red light would lead search and rescue teams (among others) to adopt red light in the cockpits of jets and helicopters.[100]:106\ufffd10 Finally, even basic research can take unexpected turns, and there is some sense in which the scientific method is built to harness luck.\\r\\n\\r\\nScientific method\\r\\nMain article: Scientific method\\r\\n\\r\\nThe central star IRAS 10082-5647 was captured by the Advanced Camera for Surveys aboard the Hubble Space Telescope.\\r\\nScientific research involves using the scientific method, which seeks to objectively explain the events of nature in a reproducible way.[g] An explanatory thought experiment or hypothesis is put forward as explanation using principles such as parsimony (also known as \\\"Occam's Razor\\\") and are generally expected to seek consilience \ufffd fitting well with other accepted facts related to the phenomena.[101] This new explanation is used to make falsifiable predictions that are testable by experiment or observation. The predictions are to be posted before a confirming experiment or observation is sought, as proof that no tampering has occurred. Disproof of a prediction is evidence of progress.[h][i] This is done partly through observation of natural phenomena, but also through experimentation that tries to simulate natural events under controlled conditions as appropriate to the discipline (in the observational sciences, such as astronomy or geology, a predicted observation might take the place of a controlled experiment). Experimentation is especially important in science to help establish causal relationships (to avoid the correlation fallacy).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a hypothesis proves unsatisfactory, it is either modified or discarded.[102] If the hypothesis survived testing, it may become adopted into the framework of a scientific theory, a logically reasoned, self-consistent model or framework for describing the behavior of certain natural phenomena. A theory typically describes the behavior of much broader sets of phenomena than a hypothesis; commonly, a large number of hypotheses can be logically bound together by a single theory. Thus a theory is a hypothesis explaining various other hypotheses. In that vein, theories are formulated according to most of the same scientific principles as hypotheses. In addition to testing hypotheses, scientists may also generate a model, an attempt to describe or depict the phenomenon in terms of a logical, physical or mathematical representation and to generate new hypotheses that can be tested, based on observable phenomena.[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile performing experiments to test hypotheses, scientists may have a preference for one outcome over another, and so it is important to ensure that science as a whole can eliminate this bias.[104][105] This can be achieved by careful experimental design, transparency, and a thorough peer review process of the experimental results as well as any conclusions.[106][107] After the results of an experiment are announced or published, it is normal practice for independent researchers to double-check how the research was performed, and to follow up by performing similar experiments to determine how dependable the results might be.[108] Taken in its entirety, the scientific method allows for highly creative problem solving while minimizing any effects of subjective bias on the part of its users (especially the confirmation bias).[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nRole of mathematics\\r\\nMain articles: Mathematics and Formal science\\r\\n\\r\\nCalculus, the mathematics of continuous change, underpins many of the sciences.\\r\\nMathematics is essential in the formation of hypotheses, theories, and laws[110] in the natural and social sciences. For example, it is used in quantitative scientific modeling, which can generate new hypotheses and predictions to be tested. It is also used extensively in observing and collecting measurements. Statistics, a branch of mathematics, is used to summarize and analyze data, which allow scientists to assess the reliability and variability of their experimental results.\\r\\n\\r\\nComputational science applies computing power to simulate real-world situations, enabling a better understanding of scientific problems than formal mathematics alone can achieve. According to the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, computation is now as important as theory and experiment in advancing scientific knowledge.[111]\\r\\n\\r\\nVerifiability\\r\\nJohn Ziman points out that intersubjective verifiability is fundamental to the creation of all scientific knowledge.[112]:44 Ziman shows how scientists can identify patterns to each other across centuries; he refers to this ability as \\\"perceptual consensibility.\\\"[113]:46 He then makes consensibility, leading to consensus, the touchstone of reliable knowledge.[113]:104\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilosophy of science\\r\\nSee also: Philosophy of science\\r\\n\\r\\nEnglish philosopher and physician John Locke (1632\ufffd1704), a leading philosopher of British empiricism\\r\\nScientists usually take for granted a set of basic assumptions that are needed to justify the scientific method: (1) that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers; (2) that this objective reality is governed by natural laws; (3) that these laws can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation.[24] Philosophy of science seeks a deep understanding of what these underlying assumptions mean and whether they are valid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe belief that scientific theories should and do represent metaphysical reality is known as realism. It can be contrasted with anti-realism, the view that the success of science does not depend on it being accurate about unobservable entities such as electrons. One form of anti-realism is idealism, the belief that the mind or consciousness is the most basic essence, and that each mind generates its own reality.[j] In an idealistic world view, what is true for one mind need not be true for other minds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are different schools of thought in philosophy of science. The most popular position is empiricism,[k] which holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation and that scientific theories are the result of generalizations from such observations.[114] Empiricism generally encompasses inductivism, a position that tries to explain the way general theories can be justified by the finite number of observations humans can make and hence the finite amount of empirical evidence available to confirm scientific theories. This is necessary because the number of predictions those theories make is infinite, which means that they cannot be known from the finite amount of evidence using deductive logic only. Many versions of empiricism exist, with the predominant ones being Bayesianism[115] and the hypothetico-deductive method.[116]:236\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Austrian-British philosopher of science Karl Popper (1902\ufffd1994) in 1990. He is best known for his work on empirical falsification.\\r\\nEmpiricism has stood in contrast to rationalism, the position originally associated with Descartes, which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect, not by observation.[116]:20 Critical rationalism is a contrasting 20th-century approach to science, first defined by Austrian-British philosopher Karl Popper. Popper rejected the way that empiricism describes the connection between theory and observation. He claimed that theories are not generated by observation, but that observation is made in the light of theories and that the only way a theory can be affected by observation is when it comes in conflict with it.[116]:63\ufffd67 Popper proposed replacing verifiability with falsifiability as the landmark of scientific theories and replacing induction with falsification as the empirical method.[116]:68 Popper further claimed that there is actually only one universal method, not specific to science: the negative method of criticism, trial and error.[117] It covers all products of the human mind, including science, mathematics, philosophy, and art.[118]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother approach, instrumentalism, colloquially termed \\\"shut up and multiply,\\\"[119] emphasizes the utility of theories as instruments for explaining and predicting phenomena.[120] It views scientific theories as black boxes with only their input (initial conditions) and output (predictions) being relevant. Consequences, theoretical entities, and logical structure are claimed to be something that should simply be ignored and that scientists shouldn't make a fuss about (see interpretations of quantum mechanics). Close to instrumentalism is constructive empiricism, according to which the main criterion for the success of a scientific theory is whether what it says about observable entities is true.\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas Kuhn argued that the process of observation and evaluation takes place within a paradigm, a logically consistent \\\"portrait\\\" of the world that is consistent with observations made from its framing. He characterized normal science as the process of observation and \\\"puzzle solving\\\" which takes place within a paradigm, whereas revolutionary science occurs when one paradigm overtakes another in a paradigm shift.[121] Each paradigm has its own distinct questions, aims, and interpretations. The choice between paradigms involves setting two or more \\\"portraits\\\" against the world and deciding which likeness is most promising. A paradigm shift occurs when a significant number of observational anomalies arise in the old paradigm and a new paradigm makes sense of them. That is, the choice of a new paradigm is based on observations, even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm. For Kuhn, acceptance or rejection of a paradigm is a social process as much as a logical process. Kuhn's position, however, is not one of relativism.[122]\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, another approach often cited in debates of scientific skepticism against controversial movements like \\\"creation science\\\" is methodological naturalism. Its main point is that a difference between natural and supernatural explanations should be made and that science should be restricted methodologically to natural explanations.[l] That the restriction is merely methodological (rather than ontological) means that science should not consider supernatural explanations itself, but should not claim them to be wrong either. Instead, supernatural explanations should be left a matter of personal belief outside the scope of science. Methodological naturalism maintains that proper science requires strict adherence to empirical study and independent verification as a process for properly developing and evaluating explanations for observable phenomena.[123] The absence of these standards, arguments from authority, biased observational studies and other common fallacies are frequently cited by supporters of methodological naturalism as characteristic of the non-science they criticize.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainty and science\\r\\nA scientific theory is empirical[k][124] and is always open to falsification if new evidence is presented. That is, no theory is ever considered strictly certain as science accepts the concept of fallibilism.[m] The philosopher of science Karl Popper sharply distinguished truth from certainty. He wrote that scientific knowledge \\\"consists in the search for truth,\\\" but it \\\"is not the search for certainty ... All human knowledge is fallible and therefore uncertain.\\\"[125]:4\\r\\n\\r\\nNew scientific knowledge rarely results in vast changes in our understanding. According to psychologist Keith Stanovich, it may be the media's overuse of words like \\\"breakthrough\\\" that leads the public to imagine that science is constantly proving everything it thought was true to be false.[100]:119\ufffd38 While there are such famous cases as the theory of relativity that required a complete reconceptualization, these are extreme exceptions. Knowledge in science is gained by a gradual synthesis of information from different experiments by various researchers across different branches of science; it is more like a climb than a leap.[100]:123 Theories vary in the extent to which they have been tested and verified, as well as their acceptance in the scientific community.[n] For example, heliocentric theory, the theory of evolution, relativity theory, and germ theory still bear the name \\\"theory\\\" even though, in practice, they are considered factual.[126] Philosopher Barry Stroud adds that, although the best definition for \\\"knowledge\\\" is contested, being skeptical and entertaining the possibility that one is incorrect is compatible with being correct. Therefore, scientists adhering to proper scientific approaches will doubt themselves even once they possess the truth.[127] The fallibilist C. S. Peirce argued that inquiry is the struggle to resolve actual doubt and that merely quarrelsome, verbal, or hyperbolic doubt is fruitless[128] \ufffd but also that the inquirer should try to attain genuine doubt rather than resting uncritically on common sense.[129] He held that the successful sciences trust not to any single chain of inference (no stronger than its weakest link) but to the cable of multiple and various arguments intimately connected.[130]\\r\\n\\r\\nStanovich also asserts that science avoids searching for a \\\"magic bullet\\\"; it avoids the single-cause fallacy. This means a scientist would not ask merely \\\"What is the cause of ...\\\", but rather \\\"What are the most significant causes of ...\\\". This is especially the case in the more macroscopic fields of science (e.g. psychology, physical cosmology).[100]:141\ufffd47 Research often analyzes few factors at once, but these are always added to the long list of factors that are most important to consider.[100]:141\ufffd47 For example, knowing the details of only a person's genetics, or their history and upbringing, or the current situation may not explain a behavior, but a deep understanding of all these variables combined can be very predictive.\\r\\n\\r\\nFringe science, pseudoscience, and junk science\\r\\nAn area of study or speculation that masquerades as science in an attempt to claim a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is sometimes referred to as pseudoscience, fringe science, or junk science.[o] Physicist Richard Feynman coined the term \\\"cargo cult science\\\" for cases in which researchers believe they are doing science because their activities have the outward appearance of science but actually lack the \\\"kind of utter honesty\\\" that allows their results to be rigorously evaluated.[131] Various types of commercial advertising, ranging from hype to fraud, may fall into these categories.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere can also be an element of political or ideological bias on all sides of scientific debates. Sometimes, research may be characterized as \\\"bad science,\\\" research that may be well-intended but is actually incorrect, obsolete, incomplete, or over-simplified expositions of scientific ideas. The term \\\"scientific misconduct\\\" refers to situations such as where researchers have intentionally misrepresented their published data or have purposely given credit for a discovery to the wrong person.[132]\\r\\n\\r\\nScientific literature\\r\\nMain article: Scientific literature\\r\\n\\r\\nCover of the first volume of the scientific journal Science in 1880.\\r\\nScientific research is published in an enormous range of scientific literature.[133] Scientific journals communicate and document the results of research carried out in universities and various other research institutions, serving as an archival record of science. The first scientific journals, Journal des S\ufffdavans followed by the Philosophical Transactions, began publication in 1665. Since that time the total number of active periodicals has steadily increased. In 1981, one estimate for the number of scientific and technical journals in publication was 11,500.[134] The United States National Library of Medicine currently indexes 5,516 journals that contain articles on topics related to the life sciences. Although the journals are in 39 languages, 91 percent of the indexed articles are published in English.[135]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost scientific journals cover a single scientific field and publish the research within that field; the research is normally expressed in the form of a scientific paper. Science has become so pervasive in modern societies that it is generally considered necessary to communicate the achievements, news, and ambitions of scientists to a wider populace.\\r\\n\\r\\nScience magazines such as New Scientist, Science & Vie, and Scientific American cater to the needs of a much wider readership and provide a non-technical summary of popular areas of research, including notable discoveries and advances in certain fields of research. Science books engage the interest of many more people. Tangentially, the science fiction genre, primarily fantastic in nature, engages the public imagination and transmits the ideas, if not the methods, of science.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecent efforts to intensify or develop links between science and non-scientific disciplines such as literature or more specifically, poetry, include the Creative Writing Science resource developed through the Royal Literary Fund.[136]\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch\\tImpact\\r\\nStatic electricity and magnetism (c. 1600)\\r\\nElectric current (18th century)\\tAll electric appliances, dynamos, electric power stations, modern electronics, including electric lighting, television, electric heating, transcranial magnetic stimulation, deep brain stimulation, magnetic tape, loudspeaker, and the compass and lightning rod.\\r\\nDiffraction (1665)\\tOptics, hence fiber optic cable (1840s), modern intercontinental communications, and cable TV and internet\\r\\nGerm theory (1700)\\tHygiene, leading to decreased transmission of infectious diseases; antibodies, leading to techniques for disease diagnosis and targeted anticancer therapies.\\r\\nVaccination (1798)\\tLeading to the elimination of most infectious diseases from developed countries and the worldwide eradication of smallpox.\\r\\nPhotovoltaic effect (1839)\\tSolar cells (1883), hence solar power, solar powered watches, calculators and other devices.\\r\\nThe strange orbit of Mercury (1859) and other research\\r\\nleading to special (1905) and general relativity (1916)\\tSatellite-based technology such as GPS (1973), satnav and satellite communications[p]\\r\\nRadio waves (1887)\\tRadio had become used in innumerable ways beyond its better-known areas of telephony, and broadcast television (1927) and radio (1906) entertainment.

He also won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his work in theoretical physics.\\r\\nScientists are individuals who conduct scientific research to advance knowledge in an area of interest.[137][138] The term scientist was coined by William Whewell in 1833. In modern times, many professional scientists are trained in an academic setting and upon completion, attain an academic degree, with the highest degree being a doctorate such as a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD),[139] Doctor of Medicine (MD), or Doctor of Engineering (DEng). Many scientists pursue careers in various sectors of the economy such as academia, industry, government, and nonprofit environments.[140][141][142]\\r\\n\\r\\nScientists include experimentalists who mainly who perform experiments to test hypotheses and theoreticians who mainly develop new models to explain existing data and predict new results. Many have a desire to understand why the world is as we see it and how it came to be. They exhibit a strong curiosity about reality. Other motivations are recognition by their peers and prestige. The Nobel Prize, a widely regarded prestigious award,[143] is awarded annually to those who have achieved scientific advances in the fields of medicine, physics, chemistry, and economics. Some scientists have a desire to apply scientific knowledge for the benefit of people's health, nations, environment, or industries.\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen in science\\r\\nMain article: Women in science\\r\\nFurther information: Women in STEM fields\\r\\n\\r\\nMarie Curie was the first person to be awarded two Nobel Prizes: Physics in 1903 and Chemistry in 1911.[144]\\r\\nScience has historically been a male-dominated field, with some notable exceptions.[q] Women faced considerable discrimination in science, much as they did in other areas of male-dominated societies, such as frequently being passed over for job opportunities and denied credit for their work.[r] For example, Christine Ladd (1847\ufffd1930) was able to enter a PhD program as \\\"C. Ladd\\\"; Christine \\\"Kitty\\\" Ladd completed the requirements in 1882, but was awarded her degree only in 1926, after a career which spanned the algebra of logic (see truth table), color vision, and psychology. Her work preceded notable researchers like Ludwig Wittgenstein and Charles Sanders Peirce. The achievements of women in science have been attributed to their defiance of their traditional role as laborers within the domestic sphere.[145]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 20th century, active recruitment of women and elimination of institutional discrimination on the basis of sex greatly increased the number of women scientists, but large gender disparities remain in some fields; over half of new biologists are female, while 80% of PhDs in physics are given to men.[citation needed] Feminists claim this is the result of culture rather than an innate difference between the sexes, and some experiments have shown that parents challenge and explain more to boys than girls, asking them to reflect more deeply and logically.[146]: 258\ufffd61. In the early part of the 21st century, women in the United States earned 50.3% of bachelor's degrees, 45.6% of master's degrees, and 40.7% of PhDs in science and engineering fields. They earned more than half of the degrees in psychology (about 70%), social sciences (about 50%), and biology (about 50-60%) but earned less than half the degrees in the physical sciences, earth sciences, mathematics, engineering, and computer science.[147] Lifestyle choice also plays a major role in female engagement in science; women with young children are 28% less likely to take tenure-track positions due to work-life balance issues,[148] and female graduate students' interest in careers in research declines dramatically over the course of graduate school, whereas that of their male colleagues remains unchanged.[149]\\r\\n\\r\\nLearned societies\\r\\nFurther information: Learned society\\r\\n\\r\\nPhysicists in front of the Royal Society building in London (1952).\\r\\nLearned societies for the communication and promotion of scientific thought and experimentation have existed since the Renaissance.[150] Many scientists belong to a learned society that promotes their respective scientific discipline, profession, or group of related disciplines.[151] Membership may be open to all, may require possession of some qualifications, or may be an honor conferred by election.[152] Membership often requires possession of some scientific credentials, or may be an honor conferred by election. Most scientific societies are non-profit organizations, and many are professional associations. Their activities typically include holding regular conferences for the presentation and discussion of new research results and publishing or sponsoring academic journals in their discipline. Some also act as professional bodies, regulating the activities of their members in the public interest or the collective interest of the membership. Scholars in the sociology of science[who?] argue that learned societies are of key importance and their formation assists in the emergence and development of new disciplines or professions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe professionalization of science, begun in the 19th century, was partly enabled by the creation of distinguished academy of sciences in a number of countries such as the Italian Accademia dei Lincei in 1603,[153] the British Royal Society in 1660, the French Acad\ufffdmie des Sciences in 1666,[154] the American National Academy of Sciences in 1863, the German Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in 1911, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1928. International scientific organizations, such as the International Council for Science, have since been formed to promote cooperation between the scientific communities of different nations.\\r\\n\\r\\nScience and the public\\r\\n\\\"Science and society\\\" redirects here. For the academic journal, see Science & Society.\\r\\nScience policy\\r\\nMain articles: Science policy, History of science policy, and Economics of science\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United Nations Global Science-Policy-Business Forum on the Environment in Nairobi, Kenya (2017).\\r\\nScience policy is an area of public policy concerned with the policies that affect the conduct of the scientific enterprise, including research funding, often in pursuance of other national policy goals such as technological innovation to promote commercial product development, weapons development, health care and environmental monitoring. Science policy also refers to the act of applying scientific knowledge and consensus to the development of public policies. Science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve the natural sciences. In accordance with public policy being concerned about the well-being of its citizens, science policy's goal is to consider how science and technology can best serve the public.\\r\\n\\r\\nState policy has influenced the funding of public works and science for thousands of years, particularly within civilizations with highly organized governments such as imperial China and the Roman Empire. Prominent historical examples include the Great Wall of China, completed over the course of two millennia through the state support of several dynasties, and the Grand Canal of the Yangtze River, an immense feat of hydraulic engineering begun by Sunshu Ao (??? 7th c. BCE), Ximen Bao (??? 5th c.BCE), and Shi Chi (4th c. BCE). This construction dates from the 6th century BCE under the Sui Dynasty and is still in use today. In China, such state-supported infrastructure and scientific research projects date at least from the time of the Mohists, who inspired the study of logic during the period of the Hundred Schools of Thought and the study of defensive fortifications like the Great Wall of China during the Warring States period.\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic policy can directly affect the funding of capital equipment and intellectual infrastructure for industrial research by providing tax incentives to those organizations that fund research. Vannevar Bush, director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development for the United States government, the forerunner of the National Science Foundation, wrote in July 1945 that \\\"Science is a proper concern of government.\\\"[155]\\r\\n\\r\\nFunding of science\\r\\nMain article: Funding of science\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Main Entomology Building in Australia\\r\\nScientific research is often funded through a competitive process in which potential research projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive funding. Such processes, which are run by government, corporations, or foundations, allocate scarce funds. Total research funding in most developed countries is between 1.5% and 3% of GDP.[156] In the OECD, around two-thirds of research and development in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry, and 20% and 10% respectively by universities and government. The government funding proportion in certain industries is higher, and it dominates research in social science and humanities. Similarly, with some exceptions (e.g. biotechnology) government provides the bulk of the funds for basic scientific research. Many governments have dedicated agencies to support scientific research. Prominent scientific organizations include the National Science Foundation in the United States, the National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Argentina, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia, Centre national de la recherche scientifique in France, the Max Planck Society and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft in Germany, and CSIC in Spain. In commercial research and development, all but the most research-oriented corporations focus more heavily on near-term commercialisation possibilities rather than \\\"blue-sky\\\" ideas or technologies (such as nuclear fusion).\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic awareness of science\\r\\nMain article: Public awareness of science\\r\\nFurther information: Science outreach and Science communication\\r\\n\\r\\nDinosaur exhibit in the Houston Museum of Natural Science\\r\\nThe public awareness of science relates to the attitudes, behaviors, opinions, and activities that make up the relations between science and the general public. it integrates various themes and activities such as science communication, science museums, science festivals, science fairs, citizen science, and science in popular culture. Social scientists have devised various metrics to measure the public understanding of science such as factual knowledge, self-reported knowledge, and structural knowledge.[157][158]\\r\\n\\r\\nScience journalism\\r\\nMain article: Science journalism\\r\\nThe mass media face a number of pressures that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims in terms of their credibility within the scientific community as a whole. Determining how much weight to give different sides in a scientific debate may require considerable expertise regarding the matter.[159] Few journalists have real scientific knowledge, and even beat reporters who know a great deal about certain scientific issues may be ignorant about other scientific issues that they are suddenly asked to cover.[160][161]\\r\\n\\r\\nPoliticization of science\\r\\nMain article: Politicization of science\\r\\n\\r\\nResults of seven papers from 2004\ufffd2015 assessing the overwhelming scientific consensus on man-made global warming (see Surveys of scientists' views on climate change), in contrast to the political controversy over this issue, particularly in the United States.\\r\\nPoliticization of science occurs when government, business, or advocacy groups use legal or economic pressure to influence the findings of scientific research or the way it is disseminated, reported, or interpreted. Many factors can act as facets of the politicization of science such as populist anti-intellectualism, perceived threats to religious beliefs, postmodernist subjectivism, and fear for business interests.[162] Politicization of science is usually accomplished when scientific information is presented in a way that emphasizes the uncertainty associated with the scientific evidence.[163] Tactics such as shifting conversation, failing to acknowledge facts, and capitalizing on doubt of scientific consensus have been used to gain more attention for views that have been undermined by scientific evidence.[164] Examples of issues that have involved the politicization of science include the global warming controversy, health effects of pesticides, and health effects of tobacco.[164][165]\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"evals\":[],\"id\":-2067386457},{\"title\":\"technology\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools.

Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's environment. Innovations have always influenced the values of a society and raised new questions of the ethics of technology. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of the term \\\"technology\\\" has changed significantly over the last 200 years. Before the 20th century, the term was uncommon in English, and it was used either to refer to the description or study of the useful arts[3] or to allude to technical education, as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (chartered in 1861).[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\\"technology\\\" rose to prominence in the 20th century in connection with the Second Industrial Revolution. The term's meanings changed in the early 20th century when American social scientists, beginning with Thorstein Veblen, translated ideas from the German concept of Technik into \\\"technology.\\\" In German and other European languages, a distinction exists between technik and technologie that is absent in English, which usually translates both terms as \\\"technology.\\\" By the 1930s, \\\"technology\\\" referred not only to the study of the industrial arts but to the industrial arts themselves.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1937, the American sociologist Read Bain wrote that \\\"technology includes all tools, machines, utensils, weapons, instruments, housing, clothing, communicating and transporting devices and the skills by which we produce and use them.\\\"[6] Bain's definition remains common among scholars today, especially social scientists. Scientists and engineers usually prefer to define technology as applied science, rather than as the things that people make and use.[7] More recently, scholars have borrowed from European philosophers of \\\"technique\\\" to extend the meaning of technology to various forms of instrumental reason, as in Foucault's work on technologies of the self (techniques de soi).\\r\\n\\r\\nDictionaries and scholars have offered a variety of definitions. The Merriam-Webster Learner's Dictionary offers a definition of the term: \\\"the use of science in industry, engineering, etc., to invent useful things or to solve problems\\\" and \\\"a machine, piece of equipment, method, etc., that is created by technology.\\\"[8] Ursula Franklin, in her 1989 \\\"Real World of Technology\\\" lecture, gave another definition of the concept; it is \\\"practice, the way we do things around here.\\\"[9] The term is often used to imply a specific field of technology, or to refer to high technology or just consumer electronics, rather than technology as a whole.[10] Bernard Stiegler, in Technics and Time, 1, defines technology in two ways: as \\\"the pursuit of life by means other than life,\\\" and as \\\"organized inorganic matter.\\\"[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnology can be most broadly defined as the entities, both material and immaterial, created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value. In this usage, technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve real-world problems. It is a far-reaching term that may include simple tools, such as a crowbar or wooden spoon, or more complex machines, such as a space station or particle accelerator. Tools and machines need not be material; virtual technology, such as computer software and business methods, fall under this definition of technology.[12] W. Brian Arthur defines technology in a similarly broad way as \\\"a means to fulfill a human purpose.\\\"[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word \\\"technology\\\" can also be used to refer to a collection of techniques. In this context, it is the current state of humanity's knowledge of how to combine resources to produce desired products, to solve problems, fulfill needs, or satisfy wants; it includes technical methods, skills, processes, techniques, tools and raw materials. When combined with another term, such as \\\"medical technology\\\" or \\\"space technology,\\\" it refers to the state of the respective field's knowledge and tools. \\\"State-of-the-art technology\\\" refers to the high technology available to humanity in any field.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe invention of integrated circuits and the microprocessor (here, an Intel 4004 chip from 1971) led to the modern computer revolution.\\r\\nTechnology can be viewed as an activity that forms or changes culture.[14] Additionally, technology is the application of math, science, and the arts for the benefit of life as it is known. A modern example is the rise of communication technology, which has lessened barriers to human interaction and as a result has helped spawn new subcultures; the rise of cyberculture has at its basis the development of the Internet and the computer.[15] Not all technology enhances culture in a creative way; technology can also help facilitate political oppression and war via tools such as guns. As a cultural activity, technology predates both science and engineering, each of which formalize some aspects of technological endeavor.\\r\\n\\r\\naspects of technological endeavor.\\r\\n\\r\\nScience, engineering and technology\\r\\n\\r\\nAntoine Lavoisier conducting an experiment with combustion generated by amplified sun light\\r\\nThe distinction between science, engineering, and technology is not always clear. Science is systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation.[16] Technologies are not usually exclusively products of science, because they have to satisfy requirements such as utility, usability, and safety.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nEngineering is the goal-oriented process of designing and making tools and systems to exploit natural phenomena for practical human means, often (but not always) using results and techniques from science. The development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge, including scientific, engineering, mathematical, linguistic, and historical knowledge, to achieve some practical result.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnology is often a consequence of science and engineering, although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields. For example, science might study the flow of electrons in electrical conductors by using already-existing tools and knowledge. This new-found knowledge may then be used by engineers to create new tools and machines such as semiconductors, computers, and other forms of advanced technology. In this sense, scientists and engineers may both be considered technologists; the three fields are often considered as one for the purposes of research and reference.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exact relations between science and technology in particular have been debated by scientists, historians, and policymakers in the late 20th century, in part because the debate can inform the funding of basic and applied science. In the immediate wake of World War II, for example, it was widely considered in the United States that technology was simply \\\"applied science\\\" and that to fund basic science was to reap technological results in due time. An articulation of this philosophy could be found explicitly in Vannevar Bush's treatise on postwar science policy, Science \ufffd The Endless Frontier: \\\"New products, new industries, and more jobs require continuous additions to knowledge of the laws of nature ... This essential new knowledge can be obtained only through basic scientific research.\\\"[18] In the late-1960s, however, this view came under direct attack, leading towards initiatives to fund science for specific tasks (initiatives resisted by the scientific community). The issue remains contentious, though most analysts resist the model that technology simply is a result of scientific research.[19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"evals\":[],\"id\":-876433920},{\"title\":\"world\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"Although in most of the English-speaking world this field is not usually regarded as a specific specialization for journalists, it is so in nearly all the world.

For journalism, it is a branch that deals with news either sent by foreign correspondents or news agencies, or \ufffd more recently \ufffd information that is gathered or researched through distance communication technologies, such as telephone, satellite TV or the internet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough in most of the English-speaking world this field is not usually regarded as a specific specialization for journalists, it is so in nearly all the world. Particularly in the United States, there is a blurred distinction between world news and \\\"national\\\" news when they include directly the national government or national institutions, such as wars in which the US are involved or summits of multilateral organizations in which the US are a member.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the birth of modern journalism, most news were foreign, as registered by the courants of the 17th century in West and Central Europe, such as the Daily Courant (England), the Nieuwe Tijudinger (Antwerp), the Relation (Strasbourg), the Avisa Relation oder Zeitung (Wolfenb\ufffdttel) and the Courante Uyt Italien, Duytsland & C. (Amsterdam). Since these papers were aimed at bankers and merchants, they brought mostly news from other markets, which usually meant other nations. In any case, it is worthy to remark that nation-states were still incipient in 17th-century Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the 19th century on, with newspapers already established in Europe, the United States and a few other countries, innovations in telecommunications such as the telegraph made news from abroad easier to be spread. The first news agencies were then founded, like AFP (France), Reuters (UK), Wolff (currently DPA, Germany) and the AP (US).\\r\\n\\r\\nWar journalism is one of the best known subfields of world news (although war coverage can be national for the media of belligerent countries themselves).\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are essentially two types of reporters who do foreign reporting: the foreign correspondent (full-time reporter employed by a news source) and the special envoy (sent abroad to cover a specific subject, temporarily stationed in a location).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe correspondent is a reporter based in a foreign city (often the capital of a country) covering a region, a country or sometimes even an entire continent. He or she regularly files stories to the news editor. He\/she gathers materials for these stories from local officials, members of the community, and the local media, as well as from events he\/she directly witnesses. Correspondents typically stay in touch with the local community and maintain contacts with other journalists and correspondents in order to identify strategic sources in the government, among diplomats, members of the military and other organizations on the ground who may provide important information.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of foreign correspondents has dropped significantly over the past 20 years or more. Often, a media company is either uninterested or unable to afford to support a single correspondent, such as in many developing countries. In some places, they cannot obtain visas due to political constraints, or otherwise dangerous conditions prohibit a media company from stationing a reporter there. In recent years, the drop in foreign correspondents has been due to cutbacks within media companies (often, but not always, a result of economics alone).[1] Among English language newspapers, only eight daily newspapers have full-time correspondents in more than ten foreign stations, four from the US, three from the UK and one from India:\\r\\n\\r\\n35 \ufffd Wall Street Journal (US): Baghdad, Bangkok, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Brussels, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Istanbul, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, Kuala Lumpur, Lagos, London, Manila, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, Paris, Prague, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, S\ufffdo Paulo, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Taipei, Tokyo, Toronto, Zurich\\r\\n\\r\\n24 \ufffd New York Times (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Cairo, Caracas, Dakar, Hong Kong, Islamabad, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Rome, S\ufffdo Paulo, Shanghai, Tokyo\\r\\n\\r\\n19 \ufffd Financial Times (UK): Beijing, Berlin, Bombay, Brussels, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, New York, Paris, Taipei, Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney, Washington\\r\\n\\r\\n17 \ufffd Washington Post (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Berlin, Bogot\ufffd, Cairo, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Shanghai, Tehran, Tokyo\\r\\n\\r\\n15 \ufffd The Guardian (UK): Accra, Bangkok, Beijing, Berlin, Brussels, Kabul, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Los Angeles, Madrid, New York, Paris, Rome, Tehran, Tokyo\\r\\n\\r\\n13 \ufffd The Daily Telegraph (UK): Beijing, Brussels, Jerusalem, Kabul, Los Angeles, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, New York, Paris, Shanghai, Sydney, Washington\\r\\n\\r\\n13 \ufffd Los Angeles Times (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Cairo, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, New Delhi, Seoul\\r\\n\\r\\n12 \ufffd The Hindu (India): Addis Ababa, Beijing, Colombo, Dhaka, Dubai, Islamabad, Kathmandu, London, Moscow, Paris, Singapore, Washington\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen reporters working abroad have no permanent labor contract with media outlets, they are called stringers.

The two countries are racing to strike an agreement by March 2, a deadline set by President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China.\\r\\nIf no deal is reached by that date, Mr. Trump has said the United States will raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.\\r\\nMr. Trump has focused on narrowing the trade gap between what the United States imports from China and what it exports, but the administration is also pressuring Beijing to scale back subsidies of state-owned enterprises, drastically open its markets to foreign investment and end its longstanding practice of forcing American companies to hand over trade secrets.\\r\\nFor years, American companies, including technology firms and automakers, have been clamoring for such changes as they try to gain access to China\u2019s growing market. But many are beginning to fear that if the continuing brinkmanship between the world\u2019s two largest economies is not resolved, American companies will be left in an even worse position.\\r\\n\u201cI would have a hard time, especially considering what\u2019s happening in Washington, believing that this will be wrapped up in a little bow by March,\u201d said Charles Freeman, senior vice president for Asia at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\\r\\nMarkets have been particularly sensitive to the state of the talks, with stocks gyrating as whispers of progress or setbacks trickle out.\\r\\nStock prices in the United States spiked last week after a Wall Street Journal report suggested that Mr. Mnuchin had recommended the removal of some tariffs to hasten a deal. They jumped again after Bloomberg News reported that China had offered to buy $1 trillion of American goods over the next six years.\\r\\nOver the weekend, Mr. Trump expressed hope that a deal could be reached but dismissed suggestions that the United States would roll back tariffs in advance of concessions from China.\\r\\n\u201cWe have taken in tremendous amounts of money in the United States because of the sanctions,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters on Saturday, apparently confusing sanctions and tariffs. \u201cIf we make a deal, certainly we wouldn\u2019t have sanctions.\u201d\\r\\nIn a tweet on Monday evening, Mr. Trump once again suggested that the United States had the upper hand in negotiations, saying China\u2019s slowing economy should hasten a trade deal.\\r\\n\u201cChina posts slowest economic numbers since 1990 due to U.S. trade tensions and new policies,\u201d the president said. \u201cMakes so much sense for China to finally do a Real Deal, and stop playing around!\u201d\\r\\nDespite Mr. Trump\u2019s optimism about reaching a deal, others in the administration and on Capitol Hill have been more circumspect.\\r\\n\u201cThis is an ongoing process with the Chinese that is nowhere near completion,\u201d a Treasury spokesman said, rebutting the suggestion that Mr. Mnuchin had recommended rolling back tariffs.\\r\\nLast week, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said that Mr. Lighthizer, who is leading the talks, had told him there had been no progress on the \u201cstructural\u201d changes that the administration sought from China.\\r\\nMr. Lighthizer, a longtime China hawk, has been pushing to ensure that China fulfills promises that Mr. Xi made to Mr. Trump during a meeting in Buenos Aires last year. Mr. Lighthizer has expressed concern to colleagues and business groups that Mr. Trump could accept a watered-down deal that reduces the trade deficit but offers only symbolic structural changes to help end the trade war and lift the stock market.\\r\\nIn an interview on the Fox Business Network on Friday, Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, said he was hopeful that a deal would be reached but acknowledged that many details still needed to be determined.\\r\\n\u201cThe technology stuff has not been dealt with, the enforcement stuff has not been dealt with,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said. \u201cThe commodity stuff and the tariff rates, we\u2019re moving on the right track.\u201d\\r\\nTo those who see the negotiations as the best opportunity to rebalance the trade relationship between Washington and Beijing, the prospect of rolling back tariffs without sweeping concessions by China would fail to achieve Mr. Trump\u2019s goal of ending what he has deemed its unfair trade practices.\\r\\n\u201cHe wants to brag about what he got, not stop tariffs and be able to brag about nothing,\u201d said Derek Scissors, a China expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.\\r\\nA slimmed-down deal could also open Mr. Trump up to criticism from Democrats, who in some cases are more aligned with the president\u2019s aggressive approach to pressuring China than many Republicans.\\r\\n\u201cAnything less than a full effort to secure a fundamental reset of the U.S.-China trade relationship is a betrayal of the American economy and the future of American workers, industry, consumers and innovators,\u201d said Representative Richard Neal of Massachusetts, the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. \u201cThe Trump administration needs to stiffen its spine and get tough in these China talks.\u201d\\r\\nTrump administration officials have been debating whether they can push more tariffs on China without facing significant repercussions. China\u2019s economy is already slowing, in part because of the tariffs, and any further weakening could hurt global economic growth and the United States economy, which is itself showing signs of cooling.\\r\\nMr. Mnuchin has been particularly interested in how big a role America\u2019s trade actions are playing in China\u2019s recent economic weakness.\\r\\nTrump administration officials have debated whether they should follow through with plans to raise tariffs to 25 percent, from 10 percent, on March 2 if China does not maintain the promises Mr. Xi made to Mr. Trump, like accelerating purchases of American goods and making structural changes to its economy.\\r\\nProgress over the next six weeks could result in an extension of the March 2 deadline, even if a final deal is not reached, or some tariff relief as a reward for initial changes that China says it is willing to make. But the decision will ultimately rest with Mr. Trump.\\r\\nOne question bedeviling the talks is how to enforce any trade agreement with China, given its opaque business environment and largely managed economy. One option that administration officials have considered is \u201csnapback\u201d tariffs, which would be reimposed if China appears to be reneging on its commitments.\\r\\nMr. Trump has pointed to China\u2019s economic weakness as a reason it should acquiesce to his country\u2019s trade demands. But the trade war is also taking a toll on the United States economy, and the monthlong shutdown could lead to an economic contraction if it continues to drag on.\\r\\nWhile business are hoping for greater access to China\u2019s markets, the strategy of using tariffs as a negotiating tool has dented business confidence. According to a survey of 277 American companies by S&P Global this month, 43 percent said they had postponed investment because of the China tariffs.\\r\\nMichael Pillsbury, a China scholar at the Hudson Institute who advises the administration, said that there were several important unknowns about the trade discussions that suggested a comprehensive deal was not near.\\r\\nIt remains unclear if there is a working text of a deal that the two countries are using to hash out an agreement. And it is unclear whether China will pressure the Trump administration to drop its efforts to extradite the chief financial officer of Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications company. The executive was arrested in Canada last year as part of a broader agreement. The complicated internal debates taking place within China\u2019s government also make it difficult to predict its willingness to make concessions.\\r\\n\u201cWe are a long way to a deal,\u201d Mr. Pillsbury said. \u201cMuch work remains to be done, especially untangling the debate in China and pressure on Xi Jinping.\u201d\\r\\nBut Mr. Trump is also under pressure and the window for him to use market-rattling tariffs as leverage is likely to shrink as his re-election campaign heats up next year.\\r\\n\u201cThe damage to U.S. business, consumers and exporters is real and ongoing,\u201d Scott Lincicome, a trade lawyer and scholar at the Cato Institute, said, noting that the risks of this approach only increased if negotiations with China dragged into 2020. \u201cIf you\u2019re the Chinese, delay is your best friend.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1413757249,\"description\":\"The United States and China will meet later this month as administration officials look to calm volatile markets amid concerns an agreement may not be in reach.\\r\",\"title\":\"Pessimism Looms Over Prospect of a Sweeping China Trade Deal\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"business.12.txt\"}],\"labelMap\":[[744716624,\"business\"],[-771583032,\"business\"],[-753305417,\"business\"],[-1898459496,\"business\"],[1657028483,\"business\"],[-783835124,\"business\"],[-476441678,\"business\"],[-445713388,\"business\"],[-1490783143,\"business\"],[788528588,\"world\"],[2035964461,\"business\"],[-1414196775,\"technology\"],[-1413757249,\"business\"],[-2063294509,\"business\"],[-430270314,\"business\"],[-1094504659,\"business\"],[1589556157,\"business\"],[-713484201,\"business\"],[1827469542,\"business\"],[-394144843,\"world\"],[-787975219,\"business\"],[-1525035125,\"world\"],[-621936301,\"world\"],[-782052188,\"technology\"],[857785162,\"business\"]],\"confusionMatrix\":[[4,0,0,0,0],[5,0,0,0,0],[4,0,0,1,0],[2,0,0,1,2],[3,0,0,0,2]],\"confusionLabels\":[\"business\",\"health\",\"science\",\"technology\",\"world\"],\"relabelingLabelMap\":[[-1413757249,\"business\"],[-783835124,\"technology\"],[-782052188,\"science\"],[2035964461,\"health\"],[744716624,\"health\"],[1589556157,\"science\"],[-1490783143,\"world\"],[-621936301,\"world\"],[-1720052767,\"health\"],[-912019104,\"world\"],[-713484201,\"world\"],[-242681196,\"health\"],[-677372880,\"world\"],[-1094504659,\"science\"],[-331952209,\"science\"],[-430270314,\"health\"],[1909517249,\"health\"],[-113826969,\"technology\"],[772145717,\"technology\"],[-275112213,\"world\"],[1398502267,\"business\"],[334877764,\"business\"],[-1080452082,\"world\"],[1261007473,\"health\"],[-234580457,\"health\"],[-1948748778,\"world\"],[-787975219,\"health\"],[-259757828,\"health\"],[-929925753,\"health\"]],\"accuracy\":0.32,\"correctRelabeled\":[-1413757249],\"labelingPrecision\":1,\"labelingRecall\":0.058823529411764705,\"correctAssignedItems\":[-1413757249],\"assignmentPrecision\":1,\"openedItems\":[],\"numOpenedItems\":0,\"selectedItems\":[],\"selectedInCategory\":0,\"selectionRecall\":null},{\"modelOperation\":\"update\",\"changedFiles\":[{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"WASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Trade Commission is in the advanced stages of its investigation into whether Facebook violated privacy rules and is expected to seek large fines from the company, according to two people familiar with the inquiry.\\r\\nThe five members of the commission met in mid-December to discuss the investigation, according to the people, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is not public.

Their agency does not have the authority to create privacy rules, but it can police businesses through a broad mandate to protect consumers from deceptive and unfair practices.\\r\\nThe investigation into Facebook began with revelations by The New York Times that a British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, had obtained data from tens of millions of Facebook users without permission. The report ignited calls for investigations by global regulators and the summoning of Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, to testify before Congress last April.\\r\\nA consent decree from 2011 requires Facebook to seek permission from users of plans to share their data with third parties. The trade commission also requires Facebook to notify it when third parties misuse user data.\\r\\nOver the past nine months, enforcement and consumer-protection officials have looked into a series of additional reports by The Times and other publications that raised questions about whether Facebook\u2019s use of data violated its consent decree, according to former officials. The expanded investigation included Facebook\u2019s partnerships with hardware and other tech giants like Netflix and Amazon that gave other companies access to Facebook user data without explicit permission.\\r\\nFacebook has said Cambridge Analytica told it that the firm had deleted the data.

Bottke, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., and one of the authors of a paper published in the journal Science. \u201cWe\u2019re changing the impact rate on the Earth by a factor of 2 to 3. That happened 290 million years ago.\u201d\\r\\n[Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.]\\r\\nThat finding was unexpected, because there is no obvious explanation for why the number of asteroids or comets would jump. This period, which came before the rise of the dinosaurs, was long past the chaotic early days of the solar system.\\r\\nOther scientists are skeptical, because the research draws its conclusions from only a small number of terrestrial and lunar craters. H. Jay Melosh, a Purdue University professor who is an expert on meteors and impacts, described the new paper as \u201can intriguing idea,\u201d but added that he was unconvinced. \\r\\n\u201cWith statistics of small numbers, that doesn\u2019t give me confidence that they\u2019re right,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t say it\u2019s wrong, either. It\u2019s just not convincing.\u201d\\r\\nThe moon should offer some clues as to what happened on Earth. It is heavily cratered, recording thousands of impacts since it formed some 4.5 billion years ago. \\r\\nBut the age of any particular lunar crater has often been uncertain. Dating of radioactive elements in the moon rocks brought back by the Apollo astronauts nearly 50 years ago has pinned down the ages of about 10 craters, said Rebecca R. Ghent, a professor of earth sciences at the University of Toronto and an author of the new paper.\\r\\nAnother method used to date some craters is more imprecise. When a crater is new, its inside is usually smooth and pristine. Over time, smaller meteors strike the surface of this interior.\\r\\nBut no one knows the precise impact rate, and counting craters is not straightforward. One impact could scatter smaller rocks across the landscape, resulting in what wrongly appear to be separate, additional impacts. \u201cThen you\u2019re going to get the wrong age,\u201d Dr. Ghent said.\\r\\nShe came up with a novel, clever alternative: taking the temperature of a crater. \\r\\nA fresh lunar crater tends to be surrounded by large boulders that were excavated by the meteor impact. The boulders retain heat when the crater rotates into darkness during the moon\u2019s nights, which last for two weeks at a time.\\r\\nIn older craters, the boulders, battered by micrometeorites for millions of years, turn to dust, which cools quickly at night. Dr. Bottke said anyone can observe this phenomenon with a walk on a beach at night: The sand is cool, while a rock in the sand is still warm.\\r\\nA heat-measuring instrument on NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter was able to differentiate warm craters from cooler ones, and the pattern seemed to hold. A 53-mile-wide crater known as Tycho, known to be young, retained warmth during nighttime, while other craters known to be much older did not. \\r\\n\u201cIt became very clear you could see the rocks in the nighttime data,\u201d said Dr. Ghent. \\r\\nShe and her colleagues calibrated the technique using the known ages of craters from the Apollo data. The correlation between the temperatures and the ages were \u201ca tight, tight fit,\u201d she said.\\r\\nThe team then looked at 111 moon craters that were more than six miles wide and less than a billion years old. What they found was that there were fewer older craters. The data suggested that the rate of impacts on the moon increased 290 million years ago.\\r\\n\u201cI was surprised,\u201d Dr. Ghent said.\\r\\nThis is not the first time that scientists have suggested an uptick in lunar impacts. In 2000, scientists at University of California, Berkeley, came to a similar conclusion based on the dating of glass spheres embedded in the Apollo moon soil. The spheres formed when rocks melted then cooled after an impact.\\r\\n\u201cTheir conclusions are broadly consistent with ours,\u201d Paul R. Renne, director of the Berkeley Geochronology Center, who was an author of the earlier paper, wrote in an email. \\r\\nSince our planet and the moon are close to each other, \u201cWe should be able to see the same pattern with the Earth,\u201d said Sara Mazrouei of the University of Toronto, lead author of the new Science paper. \\r\\nIndeed, with the method they used to date the lunar craters, the scientists found a lower rate of impacts on our planet before 300 million years ago, and almost no craters older than 650 million years. \\r\\nThe absence of older craters might be explained by what geologists describe as the \u201cSnowball Earth\u201d period, when ice covered almost the entire planet. The glaciers would have scoured the surface smooth.\\r\\nJust looking at the older parts of Earth\u2019s surface, the researchers found fewer craters than would be expected if the rate of impact then were the same as it is now.\\r\\nTo argue against erosion erasing the craters, the researchers pointed to geological features known as kimberlite pipes \u2014 carrot-shaped rock formations that form during explosive eruptions. They found only a modest amount of erosion in the kimberlites over 650 million years, and they argue that impact craters also would not have eroded much.\\r\\nThe scientists speculate that perhaps the breakup of an asteroid could have generated a slew of new space rocks that rained down in the inner solar system. \\r\\nThe European Space Agency\u2019s BepiColombo spacecraft, which will arrive at the planet Mercury in 2025, carries a similar temperature-measuring instrument, and that could tell whether there was a jump in all the pummeling at the same time there.\\r\\nDr. Melosh said a conclusive answer will likely come from the moon, but not for a while. \u201cAll these problems would be solved if we could just get to the moon and date 10,000 craters,\u201d he said.\\r\\n\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-782052188,\"description\":\"The pace of space rocks pummeling Earth and the moon was relatively infrequent, but then doubled or tripled for unknown reasons, a new study finds.\\r\",\"title\":\"What Happened to Earth\u2019s Ancient Craters?

What is a fecal transplant, and why would I want one?\\r\\nA. Fecal transplant is a medical procedure in which stool from a healthy donor is introduced into the intestine of a patient as a treatment for a disease. The idea is that the stool from the donor contains a healthful mix of gut bacteria that can seed the intestine of the patient, bringing healthful results.\\r\\nWhile the procedure may sound highly unappealing, it is not unsanitary. Stool is obtained from a donor or from a stool bank, where it has been screened for pathogens and processed for medical use.\\r\\nDonor stool may be administered via a plastic tube inserted through the nose into the stomach or small intestine. Alternatively, donor stool may be introduced into the colon via an enema or colonoscopy, or by swallowing a capsule of stool.\\r\\nFecal transplant is used as a treatment for a serious infection of the colon with Clostridium difficile, a harmful bacterium that can take hold if antibiotics kill off enough of a person\u2019s \u201cgood\u201d gut bacteria. In 2011, C. diff caused some half a million infections, 29,000 deaths and $4.8 billion in health care costs in the United States alone.\\r\\nA watershed moment in the use of fecal transplant, or what\u2019s known in the medical literature as fecal microbiota transplant, occurred in 1958, when doctors tried the procedure as a last-ditch, heroic measure in four patients with life-threatening C. diff. Remarkably, all four patients survived. The results were described as \u201cimmediate and dramatic,\u201d but because of a general revulsion to the thought of ingesting stool, fecal transplant still failed to win mainstream acceptance.\\r\\nThe tipping point occurred in 2013, with the publication of a landmark study showing fecal transplant to be superior to vancomycin, the current gold standard treatment for C. diff. Larger studies soon confirmed and extended these results.\\r\\nFecal transplant is now being studied as a treatment for obesity, recurrent urinary tract infections, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome and a host of other conditions.\\r\\nThe preliminary data are encouraging, but enthusiasm must be tempered. The Food and Drug Administration regards fecal transplant as an \u201cinvestigational new drug\u201d and has not approved it for general use. Medical insurers typically cover fecal transplant only as a treatment for recurrent, intractable C. diff.\\r\\nReported side effects have been mild and include diarrhea, cramps, nausea, constipation and flatulence, though the trials performed to date have not been large enough to detect potentially more serious problems.\\r\\nExperts offer this final piece of sage advice: \u201cIt is not recommended to perform stool transplantation at home without guidance from a physician.\u201d\\r\\nDo you have a health question?

And if you\u2019re like most patients, the metric you probably rely on most is the doctor\u2019s credentials. Where did she go to school? How many patients has he treated with this condition?\\r\\nYou might also read some Yelp reviews about how nice this doctor is; how friendly and how caring. But all that probably seems secondary to the doctor\u2019s skills; sure, it would be great to have a doctor whom you actually like, but that\u2019s not going to influence your health the way the doctor\u2019s competence will.\\r\\nBut our research in the psychology department at Stanford University suggests that this view is mistaken. We found that having a doctor who is warm and reassuring actually improves your health.\\r\\nThe simple things a doctor says and does to connect with patients can make a difference for health outcomes.\\r\\nEven a brief reassurance to a patient from a doctor might relieve the patient\u2019s symptoms faster. In a recent study that one of us conducted, our research group recruited 76 participants to receive a skin prick test, a common procedure used in assessing allergies. The provider in this study pricked participants\u2019 forearms with histamine, which makes skin itchy and red.\\r\\nThen, the doctor examined the allergic reactions. For some patients, the doctor examined them without saying much. But for other patients, the doctor had some words of encouragement. He told them: \u201cFrom this point forward, your allergic reaction will start to diminish, and your rash and irritation will go away.\u201d It turns out that this one sentence of assurance from a provider led patients to report that their reactions were less itchy \u2014 even though the doctor didn\u2019t give any medication or treatment along with his words. Words alone from the provider relieved patients\u2019 symptoms.\\r\\nThis tells us that a physician\u2019s words might be more powerful than we normally realize. And research shows that it is not only when patients are taking placebos that demeanor matters. In fact, provider words influence the efficacy of even our most powerful drugs and treatments.\\r\\nBut as anyone who has been on the receiving end of a terse \u201cYou\u2019re fine\u201d knows, it\u2019s not just what you say, it\u2019s how you say it. \\r\\nIn another study one of us worked on, we assessed whether the same words from a doctor influence patients differently depending on how warm or competent the doctor seemed. Again, patients received a histamine skin prick. Depending on what experimental group they were assigned to, patients met a provider trained to act in one of two very different ways. One group met the provider many of us dream of: she acted both warm and competent, calling patients by name, smiling, chatting and making eye contact. Her office was spotless, she spoke clearly and confidently, and she pulled off the medical procedures without a hitch.\\r\\nThe other group, however, met the kind of doctor all too many of us have encountered: glued to the computer screen throughout the exam, the provider didn\u2019t bother introducing herself and asked questions only to gather practical information. She also stumbled through some of the procedures in the messy exam room and sounded rather unsure of herself.\\r\\nIn both groups, the provider gave patients a cream that she said was an antihistamine to reduce the allergic reaction and decrease itching. The cream was merely unscented hand lotion: a placebo. (A benefit of doing this research in the lab is that for the purposes of the study, we can temporarily lead patients to believe something that is untrue, something doctors could never do in a real clinic visit.)\\r\\nDecades of robust literature on placebo effects demonstrate that, even without any active ingredients, this cream should reduce the allergic reaction. But no one had examined how the doctor\u2019s demeanor might influence the effects of a placebo treatment.\\r\\nOur study revealed that the placebo cream reduced participants\u2019 allergic reactions only when the provider projected warmth and competence. When the provider acted colder and less competent, the placebo cream had no effect. It seems that it\u2019s not just what the doctor says about a treatment that matters. It matters how the doctor who says it engages with patients. Doctors who are warmer and more competent are able to set more powerful expectations about medical treatments. Those positive expectations, in turn, have a measurable impact on health.\\r\\nSo, we saw that when the provider projected both desirable qualities of warmth and competence, her words had an effect. When she projected neither, they did not.\\r\\nWhat about a provider who seems competent, but not warm? One other group of patients met a provider who seemed highly competent but remained businesslike and distant throughout the interaction, and they did not respond to the placebo cream as much as when the provider acted warm and competent.\\r\\nPatients of even the most accomplished and skillful doctors may benefit more when that doctor also connects with them.\\r\\nAll of this research suggests that doctors who don\u2019t connect with their patients may risk undermining a treatment\u2019s success. Doctor-patient rapport is not just a fluffy, feel-good bonus that boosts Yelp reviews, but a component of medical care that has important effects on a patient\u2019s physical health. Particularly as artificial intelligence promises a world where we don\u2019t need to go to the doctor for minor questions, we should not overlook the value of interacting with a human doctor and hearing words of encouragement.\\r\\nAnd while physicians may worry that building rapport with patients requires too much time in a health care setting with visits that are already too short, there are simple ways to build warmth and competence \u2014 such as smiling, looking patients in the eye and asking their names \u2014 that don\u2019t tax doctors beyond their limits.\\r\\nWe often think the only parts of medical care that really matter are the \u201cactive\u201d ingredients of medicine: the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.

This egg was much smaller, roughly the size of a sesame seed, and contained a stink bug.\\r\\nThe mystery was this: When the egg finally hatched, it would do so virtually in unison with all the other stink bug eggs clumped around it. How? What signaled an egg on one side of the brood to hatch so soon after an egg on the other side?\\r\\nSynchronized hatching may be common in the animal world; scientist can\u2019t say for sure, as the phenomenon is not well studied. Sometimes bird eggs in the same clutch hatch individually, in a series that can unfold over more than a day. The broods of some stink bug species hatch over several hours. \\r\\nMr. Endo\u2019s brood belonged to the brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys, which is known for wreaking havoc on farms and in suburban homes across the United States. Through a series of experiments, he attempted to identify the cue that got the eggs hatching. \\r\\n\u201cAt first I had to consider every possibility \u2014 a sound, volatile chemical, vibration and pressure,\u201d he said in an email. It was only when he played a vibration at a specific frequency, and the eggs promptly hatched, that he knew he was on the right track. Additional experiments confirmed that the vibration \u2014 brief, barely audible and recorded from a hatching stink-bug egg \u2014 signaled other eggs to follow suit. \\r\\nThe discovery, described in a paper in Current Biology earlier this month, resonated not only with the stink-bug researchers of the world, but also with life-science researchers focused on biotremology, the science of vibrations.\\r\\n\u201cNot many people know about it, but they should,\u201d said Peggy Hill, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Tulsa, and author of a book called \u201cVibrational Communication in Animals.\u201d In recent years, scientists have paid increasing attention to the role that vibrations play in the lives of elephants, kangaroos, crickets and many other animals.\\r\\n\u201cWhat makes it cool is that it\u2019s something we can\u2019t hear in the air,\u201d Dr. Hill said. \u201cBut it\u2019s an essential communication cue or signal.\u201d\\r\\nHatching in unison is an advantage for the marmorated stink bug, said Hideharu Numata, a biologist at Kyoto University and an author of the new study. The hatched larvae won\u2019t eat other larvae, but they will eat the unhatched, so slowpokes risk being devoured by their new siblings. Last one out is an eaten egg.\\r\\nDr. Numata has studied stink bugs for 30 years, and in that time has come to tolerate the stink. \u201cI don\u2019t like this smell particularly, but I feel it\u2019s not so bad,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cStink bugs sometimes smell like some fruits.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1589556157,\"description\":\"In terrifying synchrony, baby stink bugs all but explode to life.\\r\",\"title\":\"Trilobites: Watch These Stink Bugs Hatch in Unison\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.5.txt\"}],\"labelMap\":[[744716624,\"health\"],[-771583032,\"business\"],[-753305417,\"business\"],[-1898459496,\"business\"],[1657028483,\"business\"],[-783835124,\"technology\"],[-476441678,\"business\"],[-445713388,\"business\"],[-1490783143,\"technology\"],[788528588,\"world\"],[2035964461,\"health\"],[-1414196775,\"technology\"],[-1413757249,\"business\"],[-2063294509,\"business\"],[-430270314,\"business\"],[-1094504659,\"technology\"],[1589556157,\"science\"],[-713484201,\"business\"],[1827469542,\"business\"],[-394144843,\"technology\"],[-787975219,\"business\"],[-1525035125,\"technology\"],[-621936301,\"world\"],[-782052188,\"science\"],[857785162,\"technology\"]],\"confusionMatrix\":[[4,0,0,0,0],[3,0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,2,0],[1,0,0,3,0],[2,0,0,1,2]],\"confusionLabels\":[\"business\",\"health\",\"science\",\"technology\",\"world\"],\"relabelingLabelMap\":[[-1413757249,\"business\"],[-783835124,\"technology\"],[-782052188,\"science\"],[2035964461,\"health\"],[744716624,\"health\"],[1589556157,\"science\"],[-1490783143,\"world\"],[-621936301,\"world\"],[-1720052767,\"health\"],[-912019104,\"world\"],[-713484201,\"world\"],[-242681196,\"health\"],[-677372880,\"world\"],[-1094504659,\"science\"],[-331952209,\"science\"],[-430270314,\"health\"],[1909517249,\"health\"],[-113826969,\"technology\"],[772145717,\"technology\"],[-275112213,\"world\"],[1398502267,\"business\"],[334877764,\"business\"],[-1080452082,\"world\"],[1261007473,\"health\"],[-234580457,\"health\"],[-1948748778,\"world\"],[-787975219,\"health\"],[-259757828,\"health\"],[-929925753,\"health\"]],\"accuracy\":0.6,\"correctRelabeled\":[-1413757249,-783835124,-782052188,2035964461,744716624,1589556157],\"labelingPrecision\":1,\"labelingRecall\":0.6,\"correctAssignedItems\":[-1413757249,-783835124,-782052188,2035964461,744716624,1589556157],\"assignmentPrecision\":1,\"openedItems\":[],\"numOpenedItems\":0,\"selectedItems\":[],\"selectedInCategory\":0,\"selectionRecall\":null},{\"modelOperation\":\"update\",\"changedFiles\":[{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"MANILA \u2014 A proposed law making its way through the Philippine Congress would consider children as young as 9 criminally responsible for their actions, drawing fierce opposition from rights advocates and opponents of President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s deadly antidrug campaign.\\r\\nThe justice panel in the House of Representatives hurriedly approved amendments on Monday to the country\u2019s juvenile justice law, which was signed in 2006 and set the minimum age for criminal liability at 15.

But Mr. Dongeto said government statistics showed that less than 2 percent of all crimes were committed by children.\\r\\nOn Monday, the national police said that from January 2017 to December 2018, more than 1,300 minors had been arrested in connection with illegal drugs. They were mostly used as \u201cdrug runners,\u201d or mules, because criminals know that children cannot be prosecuted under present laws, the police said.\\r\\nSenator Francis Pangilinan, an opposition leader and the author of the current juvenile justice law, said on Tuesday that the majority of children who committed crimes came from poor families and were simply trying to survive. Rather than targeting children, he said, the police should pursue high-level criminals and drug traffickers more effectively.\\r\\n\u201cAn iron fist is not the solution.

Unfortunately, Dr. Google doesn\u2019t always know what\u2019s best.\\r\\nA generation ago, patients were largely dependent upon the physicians they consulted as to how best to deal with a disease like cancer. Nowadays there\u2019s the internet, replete with a virtual tsunami of information offered by all kinds of sources, from experts equipped with evidence-based facts to people selling products or outright quackery. The trick is to know how to tell the difference, especially since the disparate guidance provided can become a matter of life or death.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy for people to land on a site filled with misinformation that leads them to make decisions that may not be in their best interests,\u201d Dr. Lidia Schapira, medical oncologist at Stanford University Medical Center, told me. She is editor of the very reliable site, www.cancer.net, that provides clear, scientifically vetted information about cancer and its treatment for patients, their families and friends.\\r\\nAs a specialist in breast cancer, Dr. Schapira has treated women who decline postoperative therapy with a drug like tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor because they read on the web that the treatments are harmful, despite extensive studies showing they can help prevent a breast cancer recurrence. \u201cThe conviction about harm is an emotional reaction, and it\u2019s very difficult for a doctor to talk facts through emotions,\u201d she said.\\r\\nAs the American Cancer Society cautions, \u201cThe wrong information can hurt you when it comes to cancer. A lot of what passes for cancer information on the internet is made up of opinion, salesmanship, and testimonials and is not grounded in careful science. Anyone can post any kind of information online, and some people may be passing along information that\u2019s limited, inaccurate or just plain wrong. Some even try to deceive you.\u201d\\r\\nWorried about an unexplained symptom? The internet offers about two dozen \u201csymptom checkers,\u201d and patients can actually freak themselves out by searching the web for their symptoms and finding cancer as a possible cause. Just about any symptom, from a persistent cough to chronic constipation, can be caused by cancer, but a qualified doctor can readily rule out cancer with a proper medical examination and review of a patient\u2019s personal and family history.\\r\\nLast year in The Hartford Courant, Dr. David W. Wolpaw, a family physician in Manchester, Conn., described a man in his 20s with a weekslong sore throat who had done an internet search and thought he had oral cancer. The doctor reported that the man lacked risk factors for cancer, and an exam showed he had nothing worse than a cold.\\r\\n\u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t expect a website to replace their physician,\u201d Dr. Wolpaw wrote. In addition to having completed many years of education and hands-on experience, \u201cyour doctor knows you, your medical history, family history, risk factors, etc., much better than the internet,\u201d he added. Furthermore, he wrote, \u201csites can look trustworthy even when they post information not supported by scientific evidence.\u201d\\r\\nPeople looking for the latest iteration of snake oil will surely find it on the web. Steer clear! The cancer society cautions to beware of any postings that make claims like \u201cscientific breakthrough,\u201d \u201csecret ingredient,\u201d \u201cmiraculous cure\u201d or ancient remedy,\u201d as well as products offering money-back guarantees, available from only one source or said to cure a wide range of ailments.\\r\\nThat said, people facing cancer often can glean valuable information and support through the internet. \u201cThe internet can be a tool that can give people access to good scientifically vetted information,\u201d Dr. Schapira said. \u201cIt can help patients be better prepared for a consultation with an expert. And after such a consultation, they can check on the wisdom of the advice they got.\u201d\\r\\nShe suggests relying on web-based resources that are free of commercial interests. Even sites posted by medical institutions can be self-promoting. In addition to www.cancer.net, which is prepared by members of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, Dr. Schapira recommended information offered by the American Cancer Society (www.cancer.org) and the National Cancer Institute (www.cancer.gov), as well as the free patient-oriented arm of a site called UpToDate that translates into lay terms the best available information that doctors get. \\r\\nThe cancer institute notes that the three letters attached to a site\u2019s domain name can give people insight into the independence and validity of information it contains; best to choose .edu or .gov over .com.\\r\\nIn addition to providing valuable information and guidance to trustworthy sources, the internet can help patients glean psychosocial support through online groups. In a review of 170 studies of patients who use information technology, Danielle Gentile of the Levine Cancer Institute of Atrium Health in Charlotte, N.C., and her co-authors found that social media communities can be very helpful to cancer patients, especially those who lack personal social support. Cancer patients can converse with others, anonymously or otherwise, about emotional and spiritual issues and glean helpful firsthand tips on dealing with treatment-related issues.\\r\\nBut while some online communities \u201care curated by medical professionals, others may be posted by people who have no scientific knowledge,\u201d Dr. Schapira cautioned. The information patients glean through such lay communities is best discussed with their doctors lest they be led down the garden path of bad advice.\\r\\nShe also suggested that patients not be pressured to research their cancers until and unless they are emotionally and intellectually ready to deal with the information they uncover.\\r\\n\u201cIt may be better to let others look things up,\u201d she said. \u201cDifferent people need different information at different times. Some people are not ready to absorb all the information upfront, and that\u2019s completely normal. Some want to receive the information but leave decisions to the experts, while others want to have a hand in making the decisions.\u201d\\r\\nDon\u2019t be afraid to discuss alternative remedies with the doctors treating your cancer, and be sure to tell them about any such remedy you plan to try in case it can interact badly with prescribed treatments. Nearly all major medical centers now have departments of integrative medicine, and today\u2019s oncologists are well aware of how much the mind can influence the body\u2019s well-being, Dr. Schapira said.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1261007473,\"description\":\"Dr. Google doesn\u2019t always know what\u2019s best.\\r\",\"title\":\"Personal Health: When Cancer Meets the Internet\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"health.15.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Last year, the southern Japanese city of Susaki created a position \u2014 honorary tourism ambassador \u2014 for a real-life otter with a large social media following.\\r\\nSo far, so cute.\\r\\nThen Chiitan, an unsanctioned mascot based on the otter, began staging dangerous and non-child-friendly stunts around town, like swinging a weed whacker and tipping over a car.

Compared with American mascots, the Kanagawa University sociologist Jillian Rae Suter wrote in a 2016 study, \u201cthese characters are cuter, more popular and more abundant.\u201d\\r\\nIn one sign of their popularity, Ms. Suter wrote, the number of entrants in Japan\u2019s annual Yuru-Chara Grand Prix rose to 1,727 in 2015 from 348 in 2011, the event\u2019s inaugural year.\\r\\nMr. Carlier said unofficial mascots have been around for about a decade in Japan and that many cities and towns welcome the attention. He said Funassyi, the unofficial mascot of Funabashi City, for example, has been a \u201cbig tourism draw.\u201d\\r\\nUnofficial mascots don\u2019t always make their city governments proud, however.\\r\\nIn 2014, for example, the city of Tottori disowned an official yuru-chara, Katsue-san \u2014 a teenage girl in threadbare clothes, holding a frog \u2014 three days after her debut, amid complaints that she was too depressing. But a Japanese cartoonist later gave Katsue-san a second life by making her the star of a comic strip.\\r\\n\u201cI could have become like Funassyi,\u201d the unsanctioned Katsue-san says at one point in the strip, according to The Japan Times. \u201cBut I\u2019m not as cheerful as Funassyi.\u201d\\r\\nAs for Chiitan, the rogue yuru-chara in Susaki, Mr. Carlier described it in a post last summer as \u201cJapan\u2019s fastest rising costumed character\u201d and \u201can anarchic, accident-prone otter with a turtle for a hat.\u201d He noted that Chiitan and Shinjokun, the city\u2019s official mascot, share a designer but are based on different breeds of otter.\\r\\nA spokesman for Charando, the design company that owns Chiitan, expressed remorse that it had caused problems for its hometown.\\r\\nThe spokesman, who declined to give his name, said the company had only wanted to promote Susaki, including by raising money for the city through a program that lets Japanese citizens donate tax payments to the municipalities of their choice. He added that the company had received no compensation for Chiitan\u2019s activities.\\r\\nTakashi Moritoki, a Susaki city official, said Shinjokun and other authorized city mascots were doing just fine at fund-raising. Shinjokun, for which the city owns a copyright, was created in 2013; Mr. Moritoki said Susaki\u2019s tax donations rose to the equivalent of nearly $11 million in 2018 from around $18,000 in 2015.\\r\\nMr. Moritoki said Susaki officials had initially turned a \u201cblind eye\u201d to Chiitan because they hoped the rogue mascot would help improve the city\u2019s image. But the city is now consulting a lawyer, he said, because it worries that Charando, the design company \u2014 which still owns a copyright for Chiitan \u2014 is earning money from its viral antics that might otherwise have gone to city coffers.\\r\\n\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1446855515,\"description\":\"Chiitan, an unauthorized mascot for the city of Susaki, raised eyebrows with its non-child-friendly stunts, like swinging a weed whacker and tipping over a car.\\r\",\"title\":\"A Rogue Mascot Causes Headaches for a Japanese City\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"world.5.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"This is, in many respects, a golden age for journalism.\\r\\nWith a president facing multiple federal and state inquiries \u2014 including one into whether a foreign government helped get him elected \u2014 the press has come through with some investigative work that can stand with the finest Watergate-era reporting.\\r\\nAmong readers and viewers, there\u2019s a new appreciation for shoe-leather reporting. Clicks and subscriptions are up, welcome news for an industry in shaky financial shape.\\r\\nBut the ultimate prize has proved elusive for the scoop-hungry journalists competing to join the reporters\u2019 pantheon alongside Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, whose methodical news-gathering for The Washington Post helped bring down a president alleged to have broken the law.\\r\\nThe perils of the chase were plain to see on Friday night, when the office of the special counsel issued a public denial of what had been widely portrayed as a \u201cbombshell report\u201d from BuzzFeed News.\\r\\nThe site, based in New York, has been as aggressive as any other news outlet in trying to break the Big One. Its latest attempt, published Thursday night, reported that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, had evidence that President Trump had instructed his former lawyer Michael D. Cohen to lie to Congress.\\r\\nIn their race to get ahead of Mr. Mueller with news that will please much of the electorate while also driving clicks and ratings, however, journalists throughout the media have produced their share of misfires and unforced errors. Each mistake has been a gift to the president, providing fodder for his case that any unflattering reporting about him amounts to \u201cfake news,\u201d and that the special counsel\u2019s investigation is nothing but a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\\r\\nThe insatiable appetite of social media and cable news for fresh material makes the hunt for big stories even more perilous.\\r\\n\u201cI say to you on the record, I am thankful I don\u2019t have to cover this story on a daily basis,\u201d said Mr. Woodward, whose latest book, \u201cFear,\u201d a fly-on-the-wall view of the Trump administration\u2019s first year, has sold some two million copies.\\r\\n\u201cThe hydraulic pressure in the system is just so great,\u201d he added. \u201cThe impatience of the internet \u2014 \u2018give it to us immediately\u2019 \u2014 drives so much, it\u2019s hard to sort something like this out.\u201d\\r\\nBuzzFeed\u2019s business model is built on that immediacy. Its newsroom is part of an organization whose mission is to find or create viral content. So you have serious journalism sitting almost side by side with lighthearted listicles like \u201c28 Ryan Reynolds Tweets About Parenting That Will Make You Laugh Out Loud.\u201d\\r\\nBuzzFeed News has produced top-flight work. But in fashioning itself as a 21st-century upstart challenging the traditionalists, it has also pushed the limits.\\r\\nIt was the first to publish the collection of reports that were put together by the former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele during the 2016 presidential campaign. Known as the dossier, the 35-page file was filled with what were at least then-unsubstantiated (and salacious) reports about Mr. Trump said to have been collected by Russian agents for blackmail purposes. Other news organizations, including this one, had all or part of the dossier, but decided against publishing any of its contents they couldn\u2019t independently verify.\\r\\nThe BuzzFeed News editor in chief, Ben Smith, argued that the dossier was worthy of release without full journalistic corroboration, partly because its contents had been shared with President Trump and others \u201cat the highest levels of the U.S. government.\u201d Providing that level of transparency, he argued, was \u201chow we see the job of reporters in 2017.\u201d\\r\\nBuzzFeed\u2019s report last week was more traditional, providing information from \u201ctwo federal law enforcement officials,\u201d as the article described its sources. According to the piece, Mr. Mueller was in possession of documents, text messages and testimony from Mr. Cohen showing that Mr. Trump had directed him to lie to Congress about Trump business dealings in Moscow in 2016.\\r\\nBuzzFeed said the report was months in the making. But, given the weightiness of the accusations, the final push for input from Mr. Mueller\u2019s office appears to have taken place on internet time.\\r\\nJason Leopold, one of the article\u2019s co-writers, sent a heads-up email to Mr. Mueller\u2019s spokesman, Peter Carr, only several hours before publication. In the exchange, which was first reported by The Washington Post, Mr. Leopold said that he was planning to report \u201cMichael Cohen was directed by President Trump himself to lie to Congress about his negotiations related to the Trump Moscow project.\u201d\\r\\nThe email did not mention that the article would also assert that Mr. Mueller had substantial evidence of the supposed presidential marching orders \u2014 a vital component that gave the story so much apparent heft.\\r\\nTo be fair, Fortress Mueller has been a frustration for reporters. The special counsel\u2019s office has kept leaks to a minimum while refusing, for the most part, to confirm or deny whatever report about its work is firing up the news algorithm. While its impenetrability may explain the BuzzFeed reporters\u2019 casual-seeming approach, it\u2019s not much of an excuse for skipping the steps taught in Journalism 101.\\r\\nThe Mueller team\u2019s challenge to the BuzzFeed report is also exposing the flaws of the wider media ecosystem, which is all too ready to spring into action at any sign of the Big One. Within minutes of the article\u2019s publication on Thursday, Twitter was ablaze, and cable panelists were effusive. \u201cThis is stunning,\u201d Don Lemon said on CNN. Lawrence O\u2019Donnell spoke of \u201ca Nixonian moment\u201d on MSNBC.\\r\\nFox News reported the article\u2019s claims as potentially an \u201cenormous, enormous problem for this presidency.\u201d But the guest who described it that way, the Fox News contributor Guy Benson, also warned, \u201cProceed with caution on this story \u2014 it may be true, it may not.\u201d\\r\\nBy the following morning, other news organizations had failed to match the BuzzFeed piece with their own reporting and increasingly included \u201cif true\u201d caveats \u2014 but that didn\u2019t prevent hours of on-air speculation about the potential implications of \u201csubornation of perjury,\u201d with its echoes of Watergate.\\r\\nEven after the special counsel\u2019s statement on Friday night, Rachel Maddow of MSNBC speculated that it wasn\u2019t a true denial. During an interview with Mr. Smith, she asked, \u201cDo you have any concern that this statement from the special counsel\u2019s office might be an effort to dissuade you and dissuade your reporters from pursuing this, even if it is accurate, either because it interferes with the special counsel\u2019s investigation in some way or it is otherwise too uncomfortable for this Justice Department?\u201d\\r\\nThe further the disputed report traveled, the more it seemed to help Mr. Trump, who is forever on the lookout for material for the most intensive anti-press branding campaign ever to come from the Oval Office.\\r\\nAs the former Associated Press top editor Kathleen Carroll described the current reporting environment to me: \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very, very high wire, with a load of rusty razor blades underneath it.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Woodward and Mr. Bernstein know better than most what BuzzFeed\u2019s reporters and editors are now going through. During their history-making run, the duo misreported that a grand jury had received specific testimony about a secret slush fund controlled by Nixon\u2019s chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman. The grand jury portion of the story was wrong, and the White House pounced on the error. But the substance was correct, and history ultimately vindicated them.\\r\\nMr. Smith, the BuzzFeed News editor, told me that the special counsel\u2019s office was \u201cgnomic\u201d in its denial. \u201cWe are confident that our reporting will stand up,\u201d he said.\\r\\nFor now, the story has fallen into a nether region occupied by two other recent, potentially groundbreaking stories on the Mueller investigation that have yet to be confirmed by others.\\r\\nThe first is a report  from the McClatchy newspaper chain that cellphone signals placed Mr. Cohen near Prague in 2016, around the same time the Steele dossier placed him there for a meeting with Russian officials.\\r\\nAnd there was the report in The Guardian that President Trump\u2019s former campaign manger, Paul Manafort, had paid a visit to Julian Assange, the head of WikiLeaks, before that organization released a trove of emails that the United States has accused Russian agents of stealing from the Democrats.\\r\\nWith the BuzzFeed story joining those two reports in journalistic limbo land, there are two options for the hair-trigger, Russia-investigation commentariat, said Richard Tofel, the president of ProPublica, the investigative news organization.\\r\\n\u201cOne is, try to figure out right this minute what the truth is, when you have no way of knowing,\u201d Mr. Tofel said. \u201cOr two, and both social media and cable news are a little bit at war with this: Wait a minute.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1615598764,\"description\":\"From the posting of the dossier to the publication of a story now in dispute, BuzzFeed News is learning about the perils of the chase.\\r\",\"title\":\"Mediator: BuzzFeed News in Limbo Land\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"business.16.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"A giant ice disk churning in a river that runs through the small city of Westbrook, Me., set off fevered speculation on Tuesday.\\r\\nWas it an icy landing zone for aliens?

He will be Lanvin\u2019s fourth designer in four years.\\r\\nIn choosing Mr. Sialelli, 31, a designer whose training spans both men\u2019s and women\u2019s wear, and uniting both sectors under his leadership, Fosun is readying for a \u201cpivotal new direction\u201d at Lanvin, the fashion brand said in the announcement. One, presumably, that speaks to the gender-fluid present as opposed to the romanticized past, one in which the traditional distinctions between wardrobes are erased (and one that is in line with the exceptionally successful reinventions of brands such as Gucci). And they are doing so by eschewing a star designer in favor of a new name.\\r\\nMr. Sialelli\u2019s \u201csingular and very personal vision, his audacity, his culture, his energy and ability to build a strong creative team definitely convinced us,\u201d Mr. Hecquet said in the announcement. He was in China and not available for further comment.\\r\\nThere is a lot riding on the choice, not just for Mr. Sialelli but also for Fosun, a relative newcomer to the luxury industry.\\r\\nLanvin was once the darling of the fashion set thanks to the designer Alber Elbaz, who along with the former owner Shaw-Lan Wang revived the house he called a \u201csleeping beauty\u201d and made it beloved of stars like Meryl Streep and Natalie Portman. But it has recently suffered from poor management, designer churn, plunging revenues and internal strife. After a disagreement with Mrs. Wang, Mr. Elbaz was fired in 2015; he was replaced the next year by Bouchra Jarrar, who lasted only 16 months before also coming into conflict with management. Her successor, Olivier Lapidus, made it half as long.\\r\\nThough Lanvin men\u2019s wear was overseen for 14 years by Lucas Ossendrijver (who left last November), the house had been largely defined by Mr. Elbaz\u2019s women\u2019s wear, and the result of the chaos after his dismissal was an almost total loss of identity. By the time Fosun bought the company early last year, it was seen as an example of how quickly brand equity and reputation could be destroyed, rather than as a heritage jewel. (The label was founded by Jeanne Lanvin in 1899.) \\r\\nThe one place its storied past did continue to have resonance, however, was in China. At the time of the sale, Joann Cheng, chairwoman of Fosun Fashion Group, said: \u201cAs China becomes the main growth driver of the global luxury market, we are confident that Fosun can bring great incremental value to Lanvin with our global resources and expertise, while being absolutely committed to Lanvin\u2019s high luxury positioning.\u201d\\r\\nFosun owns the Italian men\u2019s wear brand Caruso, the Austrian hosiery brand Wolford and the American knitwear company St. John, but it had never taken on a turnaround as high-profile as Lanvin. As the Chinese increasingly want to be not just consumers of luxury goods but owners of the brands themselves \u2014 with dreams of creating groups to rival the European behemoths Kering and LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton \u2014 how Fosun handles Lanvin will be a test case of whether they can compete.\\r\\nMr. Sialelli is something of a wild card in this. He was at Loewe for about two and a half years under Jonathan Anderson, who is credited with reinventing that brand as an art-and-craft-focused house, but where men\u2019s wear has been a relatively small part of the business. Earlier, Mr. Sialelli had done stints in women\u2019s wear at Acne Studio, Paco Rabanne and Balenciaga. Raised in Marseille, France, he was educated at Studio Ber\u00e7ot in Paris. \\r\\nThe shape, literal and metaphorical, of his new Lanvin may be revealed as early as next month during Paris Fashion Week, making him part of a new guard in fashion that includes Daniel Lee, another youthful unknown making his debut at Bottega Veneta in February.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-788369064,\"description\":\"Bruno Sialelli, a 31-year-old unknown, is taking on the troubled French brand for its new owner, Fosun International.\\r\",\"title\":\"A New Designer Is Named to Reinvent Lanvin\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"business.13.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"WELLINGTON, New Zealand \u2014 They dumped chips on someone\u2019s beach blanket.

The tourism industry expects five million visitors a year by 2024 \u2014 more than New Zealand\u2019s current population of 4.8 million.\\r\\nPopular tourist spots around New Zealand have reported that the local infrastructure cannot handle the tourist influx, forcing the government to scramble to mitigate the damage. Starting later this year, visitors to New Zealand will pay a fee of 35 New Zealand dollars, or about $23, which will be split between conservation and infrastructure. And last October, the fees to stay at huts or campsites in New Zealand\u2019s most popular national parks for hiking were doubled for overseas visitors.\\r\\nJim Boult, the mayor of Queenstown, a popular ski resort town where visitors outnumber locals 34 to 1, said he was glad the government was aware of the problem, but said the new visitor tax \u2014 even if awarded solely to Queenstown \u2014 would not scratch the surface of what tourism was costing the town. He wants a larger, more targeted levy instead.\\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019re the shop window for New Zealand,\u201d he said, referencing photos of the area that he said drove \u201ca large percentage of tourist numbers.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cQueenstown is having to mortgage itself to the hilt for the rest of the country\u2019s benefit,\u201d he said, adding that growing local government debt to finance the area\u2019s rapidly growing infrastructure and accommodation needs were driving up costs for local residents, many of whom struggled to find affordable housing in a pricey rental market catering to wealthy tourists.\\r\\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think that is fair,\u201d he said.\\r\\nThe boom is only expected to continue. In February, New Zealand will introduce a yearlong Chinese tourism initiative; China is the country\u2019s second largest source of tourists after Australia, and the fastest growing. The campaign aims to attract visitors during off-peak times and to lesser-known regions, and also to help businesses better cater to visitors from China.\\r\\nBut Mr. Milne, the tourism professor, said not enough had been done to prepare New Zealand communities for an expected doubling in the number of Chinese visitors. He added that New Zealand had a history of overlooking local residents\u2019 concerns as it sought to aggressively increase tourism.\\r\\nThe British family accused of wreaking a trail of havoc down the North Island over the last month first came to public attention when a woman in Auckland, the country\u2019s largest city, filmed a dispute over the family members\u2019 refusal to pick up trash they had appeared to leave behind at Takapuna Beach in Auckland, New Zealand\u2019s largest city.\\r\\nThree members of the family did not respond to interview requests. But Barbara Doran, one of the tourists, told The Daily Mail that her family had been \u201ctortured\u201d by New Zealanders and had done nothing wrong.\\r\\nAlthough the family members had been issued deportation notices by New Zealand immigration officials after an incident at a Burger King in the city of Hamilton, some remained in the country as of Tuesday (New Zealand permits visitors to appeal deportation notices, and they cannot be deported until their appeals are complete.) One of the family members, Tina Maria Cash, was convicted of theft in the Hamilton District Court and ordered to pay 55 New Zealand dollars for stealing from a gas station.\\r\\nIt is not the first time outraged New Zealanders have confronted tourists.

For three hours and 40 minutes, Duncan MacDougall recalibrated his scales by fractions of ounces as the dying man\u2019s nose and mouth dried out, and his last sweat evaporated off his skin. \\r\\nAt the moment of the patient\u2019s death (9:10 p.m.), Dr. MacDougall recorded that the scales registered an abrupt, inexplicable weight loss of three-fourths of an ounce. (To be certain this was not the effect of all the man\u2019s breath leaving his body, the doctor then climbed onto the bed and breathed deeply; this did not affect the scales.) \\r\\nThis incident gave rise to a notion that the human soul weighs roughly 21 grams; however, the doctor\u2019s subsequent experiments, including a frantic attempt to document the weight of a woman dying of a diabetic coma, failed to achieve identical results. (Dr. MacDougall complained that that effort was thwarted by \u201ca good deal of interference by people opposed to our work,\u201d perhaps medical staff attempting to save a woman dying of a diabetic coma, a circumstance that need not be fatal.) \\r\\nA century later, Dr. MacDougall\u2019s hypothesis has been largely rejected. But we do now possess the technology to know what a celebrity\u2019s daughter\u2019s doll is thinking.\\r\\nQai Qai is a baby doll with brown plastic skin, wrinkled newborn feet, a blithe countenance and over 90,000 Instagram followers at most recent tally. She is the plaything of Olympia Ohanian, the daughter of the tennis star Serena Williams and her tech entrepreneur husband, Alexis Ohanian. Qai Qai is apparently also the direct descendant of Olympia Ohanian; text on her riveting (and verified) Instagram account, @RealQaiQai, identifies her as the \u201cgranddaughter\u201d of Ms. Williams and Mr. Ohanian. It\u2019s pronounced \u201ckway kway.\u201d\\r\\nQai Qai takes several (known) forms: She is a doll; an Instagram user; a Twitter user; an animated representation of a doll superimposed onto digital photos; and an imagined Gremlin-like character wreaking pretend havoc on the hypothetical lives of Olympia Ohanian and her family. \\r\\nQai Qai appears to have entered our collective consciousness early last August, when Ms. Williams uploaded a video of the doll lying in tricycle wreckage, explaining off-camera that she was documenting the scene \u201cfor Olympia\u2019s insurance.\u201d (She also accused Qai Qai of \u201cvandalism.\u201d) \\r\\nOn Aug. 14, Ms. Williams told reporters at a post-match news conference that she was \u201ckind of having to take care of Qai Qai now\u201d because her infant daughter wanted \u201cto live her life.\u201d That day, a Twitter account called @RealQaiQai posted its first tweet. \\r\\nThe following week, the @RealQaiQai Instagram account shared its first post. Earlier this week, an ESPN2 graphic from the Australian Open reminded viewers that Ms. Williams\u2019s daughter\u2019s doll had twice as many Twitter followers as Ms. Williams\u2019s current opponent, who lost the match.\\r\\nWhy?\\r\\nBecause Qai Qai is something increasingly rare and prized in modern online society: mildly entertaining.\\r\\nThe earliest Qai Qai content was wordless, evocative imagery of abandonment: the doll lying facedown on hardwood floor and on private jet tarmac; stuffed behind a hotel suite cushion; jammed headfirst into a sandbox at a resort where Ms. Williams was participating in a tennis exhibition. \\r\\nFor reasons never explained, her limbs were frequently set in plastic doll casts. Sometimes she was pictured with tiny crutches.\\r\\nThe posts evolved. Some of the changes have enhanced the enjoyment of Qai Qai; the visual juxtaposition of the cherubic doll with new world-weary captions written from Qai Qai\u2019s point of view could be genuinely funny, as when a slide show revealed Qai Qai emerging from behind a kitchen island to ask the world, \u201cWhat y\u2019all mad about today?\u201d (Neither Ms. Williams nor Mr. Ohanian have claimed authorship.) \\r\\nIt is pleasant to view drone footage of Qai Qai alone on a yacht uploaded by Mr. Ohanian. Other additions, like an animated graphic Qai Qai digitally imposed on extant photos that Ms. Williams and Mr. Ohanian interact with across social platforms, are less welcome.\\r\\nIt\u2019s not known how Olympia came to possess Qai Qai. The doll may have been quasi-anonymously forged in the opaque fires of e-commerce hell, because it is a nearly exact match to an out-of-stock toy sold on Amazon under the brand name Dolls to Play. (Luckily, I ordered one.)\\r\\nDolls to Play appears to exist solely on Amazon; a Google search of the label leads to a random product repository website that redirects to multiple different, yet seemingly identical, random product repository websites, all of which appear to blindly scrape information from Amazon. \\r\\nDolls to Play toys are sold by an Amazon storefront called \u201cNumber 1 in Service,\u201d which stocks thousands of unrelated products (orders fulfilled by Amazon). The same bedroom stock image pictured in the Amazon listing for the doll also appears spliced with a bedding set on Wayfair, and empty on a spam blog of house decorating keywords interspersed with the phrase \u201cin Nigeria.\u201d\\r\\nThe doll I received was not the doll pictured, which wore pink; it is an exact Qai Qai copy, dressed in white. The box says \u201cMADE IN NANJING, CHINA\u201d and also \u201cBROOKLYN LOLLIPOPS\u201d \u2014 a company that lists a Brooklyn address, at a co-working space. Brooklyn Lollipops has its own Amazon listing for the same doll, also available for purchase from Walmart.com (online only).\\r\\nYet it is possible that the sensational Qai Qai found her way to Olympia Ohanian from a realm even weirder than the bowels of the internet: in real life. Qai Qai\u2019s Twitter account recently shared an image of a store shelf stocked with multiple races of Qai Qai, which appear to cycle through the inventories of various discount department stores.\\r\\nIf you would like to see more Qai Qai, many videos of the doll initially posted to Ms. Williams\u2019s social media accounts can be found combined into odd YouTube compilations with unrelated real estate footage by an account called Hestia Olympia\u2019 Celebrity, Lifestyle & Culture, the avatar of which is a French oil painting that has been a part of Russia\u2019s State Hermitage Museum collection since it was acquired in 1764 by Catherine the Great as part a lot of hundreds of paintings \u201cof uneven quality.\u201d\\r\\nThe combined weight of the doll named Qai Qai plus her stroller is approximately 1,293 grams: roughly 61-and-a-half souls.\\r\\n\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1763094825,\"description\":\"Short answer: yes.

It\u2019s a question roiling educational circles, and one The New York Times explored in a recent series of articles. \\r\\nAt the center of the debate are organizations like Code.org, a nonprofit group that advocates computer science training and provides coding curriculum for schools around the country. \\r\\nFounded by Hadi Partovi, an Iranian immigrant who had an enormously successful career in the technology industry, Code.org is backed by companies including Google, Facebook and Microsoft.\\r\\nMr. Partovi grew up in Iran during the revolution, moving to the United States when he was 11. He attended Harvard, then joined Microsoft, where he worked on Internet Explorer during the browser wars. \\r\\nAfter leaving Microsoft he founded Tellme Networks, which was acquired by Microsoft for $800 million. He is also an angel investor, and was an early backer of Facebook, Dropbox and Airbnb.\\r\\nMr. Partovi\u2019s relatives are similarly precocious. His twin brother, Ali, also founded a company that was sold to Microsoft. And his cousins include Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive of Uber, as well as senior executives at Intel, Google and Allen & Company, the influential investment bank. \\r\\nThis interview, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was conducted in San Francisco. \\r\\nWhat was your childhood like? \\r\\nWhen I was 7 and the country was going through a revolution and war, I don\u2019t remember thinking, \u201cOh my god, I\u2019m suffering hardship.\u201d I had no context. I just was like, \u201cO.K. This sucks. But I can just go on with the day.\u201d I got used to seeing people getting killed and waking up every morning to go to the roof to see which houses near us were still standing or not. Thinking about it now, I\u2019m like, \u201cGod, that\u2019s horrible.\u201d Back then, that was just routine.\\r\\nWhat did your parents do? \\r\\nBoth my parents were educated in the United States. My dad had gone to M.I.T. My mom was a computer scientist from Boston University. And we had a whole lot of extended family here.\\r\\nPart of the challenge for me living in Iran was that my entire family, other than my mom and dad and brother, basically had left and fled the country, and we stayed behind. The reason we stayed behind was that my father had started the technology university there, and he said, \u201cThe country\u2019s going through all this challenge, but if the education system falls apart, who knows what\u2019s going to happen?\u201d\\r\\nWhen did you get interested in technology? \\r\\nMy dad started teaching us on a programmable calculator when my brother and I were 8 years old. And then the next year, he brought a Commodore 64 home. In Iran at the time, there was nothing fun to do. There was no Xbox, no PlayStation, no internet. We had one TV channel; it was all propaganda. There were no sports in school. So for us, this computer was an escape from just a horrid life situation. It was really the only good thing we had in our life.\\r\\nHow did you get out of Iran?\\r\\nTo get the permission to leave, my dad had to promise the minister of education that he was coming back \u2014 that he wasn\u2019t taking his family to leave forever. He was like, \u201cI give you my word. I\u2019m coming back.\u201d And when we came to America, pretty much the first thing he did was to say, \u201cAll right. I\u2019m going back. You guys can stay here.\u201d \\r\\nMy mom was like, \u201cWhat are you talking about? We\u2019re done with that country.\u201d And he said, \u201cI just want to go for one or two years because I gave my word, and then I\u2019ll join you guys.\u201d So we spent a year or two in America with our dad living in Iran, only because he wanted to stay true to his word.\\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to prepare kids for jobs. We\u2019re trying to prepare kids for life.\u201d \u2014 Hadi Partovi\\r\\nTell me about arriving in the United States.\\r\\nWe were not well-off at all. Our family couldn\u2019t afford a home. So all four of us lived in one bedroom in my grandma\u2019s house in one bed, which is an awkward thing to do when you\u2019re 12 years old. My parents worked three jobs, but they put all of the money toward our education. That left an imprint of how important education is. Education is the No. 1 thing you should invest in.\\r\\nYou have many relatives who\u2019ve also been successful in the technology industry. How do you explain that? \\r\\nEntrepreneurship is in my family\u2019s blood. My grandfather and all of his brothers started a great company together almost 100 years ago. It was called Alborz Corporation, and it was one of the largest industrial companies in Iran. They started by being a trading company and importing goods, but then all the most popular goods they\u2019d import they\u2019d start manufacturing locally, in partnership with whoever was the original producer. Then the entire company was taken away by the government as part of the revolution. So growing up in America, there was this desire for us to effectively make back the money that our family had lost.\\r\\nAfter you graduated college you went to work for Microsoft. What did you work on while you were there?\\r\\nThe project I\u2019m most proud of is Internet Explorer. Today, Internet Explorer is the dead bastard stepchild of the Web browser market. But I joined that team when it was nine people and two years behind Netscape Navigator in the famous browser wars. It was one of the craziest start-up experiences in a very large company. My proudest creation there was Internet Explorer 5.0 and 5.5. At the time it was a really fantastic product.\\r\\nIt\u2019s a bit hard to imagine Microsoft acting like a start-up.\\r\\nThe Internet Explorer team was probably the hardest-working team I\u2019ve ever been on. And I\u2019ve been at multiple start-ups. We would have foosball tournaments for the team at 2 a.m., just to get everybody\u2019s energy back up to continue working. Everybody was working every day, every night. One of the team managers had a sign on his door saying, \u201cThis is why I\u2019m going home this evening.\u201d And it was a picture that his daughter had made of the family that showed mommy and daddy and son. But, the picture of daddy was a car leaving the garage. There were many divorces and broken families and bad things that came out of that. But what I learned was that even at a 20,000-person company, you can get a team of 50 or 100 people to work like their life depends on it.\\r\\nYou\u2019ve gone on to be an angel investor. How do you decide which companies to invest in?\\r\\nI give coding interviews to the chief technology officers of any start-up I invest in. When I met Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi from Dropbox, I flew them out to meet in Seattle, and I had them both do coding interviews in my house. I had them take a list of numbers and remove all the duplicates from the list. And the other was to write the code to shuffle a deck of cards. So, relatively simple stuff. I mean, you should be able to do it in 20 minutes if you know what you\u2019re doing. It\u2019s not rocket science.\\r\\nI\u2019m not a coder. Is there one right answer to those questions?\\r\\nNo. There\u2019s a little back and forth of seeing how you\u2019re going to go about the problem. And also since these were two that were going to be start-up founders, what are their communication skills like? Because if the C.E.O. just writes the answers and gives it back to you, that\u2019s different than if they walk you through their thinking and explain why they come up with something. When you\u2019re interviewing a potential leader you need to look for both of those things.\\r\\nHow did Code.org get started?\\r\\nThe moment of inspiration was the day Steve Jobs died. I had wanted to make a video that featured the best technologists talking about the importance of computer science, and I was like, \u201cGod. The best of them just died. He can\u2019t be in my video anymore.\u201d That gave me the onus to start Code.org.\\r\\nAnd why is it so important that kids learn to code? \\r\\nThe idea for Code.org isn\u2019t that every kid should learn to code, it\u2019s that every school should teach computer science. We use the word \u201ccoding\u201d because it\u2019s more hip. But computer science really is a subject that needs to be taught. And the reason for this isn\u2019t because there\u2019s so many coding jobs or that coding pays well or things like that. The reason is because computer science is foundational. Every school teaches biology, every school teaches chemistry, every school teaches algebra. You wouldn\u2019t envision going to a school that just said, \u201cWe don\u2019t teach that.\u201d \\r\\nWe\u2019ve done some reporting on the influence that big tech companies are gaining over educational curriculum. Is that appropriate? \\r\\nWhat Code.org does is focus primarily on foundational learning. And even when we involve our industry donors, we\u2019re very clear with them that what we\u2019re doing isn\u2019t vocational. You can\u2019t take Code.org\u2019s courses and then get a job at Google. But it gets you interested that maybe, hey, I might want to pursue that.\\r\\nThere are a few companies that are proactively trying to get their platform into schools or trying to sell their devices into schools and there\u2019s some self-interest there, but the Code.org ecosystem doesn\u2019t have that. \\r\\nDo you think there should be legislation that mandates schools teach computer science?\\r\\nI believe schools should be mandated to teach computer science. You would never send your child to a school that didn\u2019t teach math. In the 21st century, computer science is as important as biology. Understanding photosynthesis or H2O or electricity is just as foundational as understanding how the internet works or what an algorithm is. These things are impacting our daily lives. We need future lawyers and doctors and politicians to all understand it. We\u2019re not trying to prepare kids for jobs. We\u2019re trying to prepare kids for life.\\r\\n\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1691764127,\"description\":\"The founder and chief executive of Code.org, who was born in Iran, says computer science is a \u201cfoundational skill,\u201d one that future doctors, lawyers and politicians should all possess.\\r\",\"title\":\"Corner Office: Hadi Partovi Was Raised in a Revolution.

According to one study, commuting is one of the least pleasant things we do. But it\u2019s not just an annoying time waster \u2014 there\u2019s a case that it\u2019s a public health issue.\\r\\nAccording to analysis by the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, the average American commuter spends 42 hours per year stuck in rush-hour traffic. In the Los Angeles area, the figure is nearly twice that, equivalent to more than three days. A 2015 Los Angeles Times poll found that among residents of that city, traffic concerns exceed those pertaining to personal safety, finances or housing costs.\\r\\nThe total cost of traffic associated with lost time and wasted fuel exceeds $100 billion per year. As time slips away, idling vehicles add pollution, which has environmental and health consequences, including contributions to climate change.  Long-term exposure to vehicle exhaust is associated with respiratory problems, especially in children. \\r\\nAnother toll is to psychological well-being, stemming from the sense of helplessness we experience in traffic, and its unpredictability. This, too, can be quantified. One study found that to save a minute of time spent in traffic, people would trade away five minutes of any other leisure activity. Another study found that we deal better with the commuting delays that we can anticipate.\\r\\nStressed-out people can take out their frustration on others. We\u2019ve probably all experienced or seen road rage, but aggressive behavior can carry over beyond a commute. \\r\\nA recent analysis of Los Angeles traffic, published in the Journal of Public Economics, documented a link between congestion and domestic violence. From 2011 to 2015, the study found, extreme evening traffic on two major highways \u2014 I-5 and I-10 \u2014 increased the incidence of nighttime domestic violence by about 9 percent.\\r\\nWhat the researchers, Louis-Philippe Beland, an economist at Louisiana State University, and Daniel Brent, an economist at Penn State, mean by \u201cextreme traffic\u201d in their study is best explained with an example: The average evening commute along I-10 for residents of Santa Monica in their study was 45 minutes. Extreme traffic would increase this to 87 minutes.\\r\\n \u201cLife stressors act as emotional cues,\u201d Mr. Beland said. \u201cWhat our work shows is that in extreme cases some people\u2019s responses to those cues can be quite large, leading to violence.\u201d\\r\\nTeaching children how to manage stress and traumatic events from a young age can be important. \u201cThroughout life, mindfulness, healthy eating, sleeping and exercise, and hobbies that blow of steam all help,\u201d said Rebecca Mooney, director of Melrose Alliance Against Violence, which raises awareness about domestic violence and related issues in and around Melrose, Mass.\\r\\nOfficials are not powerless before the problems that stressful commutes can cause. Los Angeles has put in a system that charges solo drivers more to use certain lanes of the I-10 and I-110 highways during periods of heavy traffic. This encourages drivers to move their commutes to less congested times or routes. A study of congestion pricing on Seattle\u2019s SR-520 Bridge found that drivers using the route and its alternatives were less stressed and more satisfied with their commutes after the pricing change.\\r\\nIn addition, many states have been replacing tollbooths with electronic and cashless tolling systems like E-ZPass. More employers are allowing people are working remotely. Troubled transit systems in some cities may be partly behind an increase in car ownership in those areas, but certain West Coast cities are making sweeping expansions of their public transit systems, and many cities are adding bike lanes. \\r\\nThose who can walk or bike to work tend to have a double advantage. Not only do they avoid the harmful consequences of traffic, but they can also improve their health through exercise. Younger people are more likely to prefer that style of commuting, and are driving less than previous generations. \\r\\nThere may be more good news in coming decades for those who loathe gridlock. Although self-driving cars won\u2019t cure traffic woes on their own \u2014 the way that economics-based approaches like congestion pricing can \u2014 they may be able to reduce stress.\\r\\nIf you\u2019re crawling along in traffic and are late to an appointment, but are allowed to take a nap, play video games, watch your favorite TV show or sip on a cocktail, will that reduce your stress? We don\u2019t know for sure, but we look forward to the studies on that. \",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1720052767,\"description\":\"The physical and psychological toll of brutal commutes can be considerable.\\r\",\"title\":\"The New Health Care: Stuck and Stressed: The Health Costs of Traffic\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"health.16.txt\"}],\"labelMap\":[[744716624,\"health\"],[-771583032,\"business\"],[-753305417,\"business\"],[-1898459496,\"business\"],[1657028483,\"business\"],[-783835124,\"technology\"],[-476441678,\"business\"],[-445713388,\"business\"],[-1490783143,\"world\"],[788528588,\"world\"],[2035964461,\"health\"],[-1414196775,\"technology\"],[-1413757249,\"business\"],[-2063294509,\"business\"],[-430270314,\"business\"],[-1094504659,\"technology\"],[1589556157,\"science\"],[-713484201,\"world\"],[1827469542,\"business\"],[-394144843,\"technology\"],[-787975219,\"business\"],[-1525035125,\"technology\"],[-621936301,\"world\"],[-782052188,\"science\"],[857785162,\"technology\"],[1261007473,\"health\"],[1446855515,\"business\"],[-1615598764,\"business\"],[-677372880,\"technology\"],[-788369064,\"business\"],[-912019104,\"health\"],[-331952209,\"health\"],[1763094825,\"technology\"],[1691764127,\"technology\"],[-1720052767,\"business\"]],\"confusionMatrix\":[[6,0,0,0,0],[4,1,0,0,0],[1,1,0,3,0],[1,0,0,5,0],[2,1,0,0,3]],\"confusionLabels\":[\"business\",\"health\",\"science\",\"technology\",\"world\"],\"relabelingLabelMap\":[[-1413757249,\"business\"],[-783835124,\"technology\"],[-782052188,\"science\"],[2035964461,\"health\"],[744716624,\"health\"],[1589556157,\"science\"],[-1490783143,\"world\"],[-621936301,\"world\"],[-1720052767,\"health\"],[-912019104,\"world\"],[-713484201,\"world\"],[-242681196,\"health\"],[-677372880,\"world\"],[-1094504659,\"science\"],[-331952209,\"science\"],[-430270314,\"health\"],[1909517249,\"health\"],[-113826969,\"technology\"],[772145717,\"technology\"],[-275112213,\"world\"],[1398502267,\"business\"],[334877764,\"business\"],[-1080452082,\"world\"],[1261007473,\"health\"],[-234580457,\"health\"],[-1948748778,\"world\"],[-787975219,\"health\"],[-259757828,\"health\"],[-929925753,\"health\"]],\"accuracy\":0.6285714285714286,\"correctRelabeled\":[-1413757249,-783835124,-782052188,2035964461,744716624,1589556157,-1490783143],\"labelingPrecision\":1,\"labelingRecall\":0.5384615384615384,\"correctAssignedItems\":[-1413757249,-783835124,-782052188,2035964461,744716624,1589556157,-1490783143],\"assignmentPrecision\":1,\"openedItems\":[],\"numOpenedItems\":0,\"selectedItems\":[],\"selectedInCategory\":0,\"selectionRecall\":null},{\"modelOperation\":\"update\",\"changedFiles\":[{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"MEXICO CITY \u2014 Word spread quickly: free gasoline. It was spewing from a pipeline, through a hole punched by fuel thieves. People \u2014 as many as 900, by some estimates \u2014 flocked to the rupture, many carrying containers to fill.\\r\\nBut just as quickly, the apparent windfall on Friday turned to disaster when the pipeline exploded in flames, killing at least 89 and wounding scores more.\\r\\nAmid the national lamenting, some Mexicans have insisted that the victims had only themselves to blame: They were breaking the law, pilferers taking what wasn\u2019t theirs, and had put themselves in harm\u2019s way.\\r\\nBut the man steering the nation\u2019s response to the incident, President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, has rejected that view, arguing that the people were compelled to participate by the poverty and unemployment caused by past government policies.\\r\\n\u201cWe have the conviction that the people are good, that they are honest, that if they arrived at these extremes, these practices, it\u2019s because they were completely abandoned\u201d by the state, he said at a news conference over the weekend.\\r\\nHis cabinet has followed suit. \u201cWe are not going to victimize the communities,\u201d said Alejandro Gertz, Mexico\u2019s attorney general.\\r\\nThe disaster, which occurred in the state of Hidalgo just north of Mexico City, has become a major early test of the policy and leadership of Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, who took office on Dec. 1.\\r\\nThe president\u2019s response has revealed a central tension as he has sought to walk a difficult tightrope between two longstanding vows: being tough on crime and corruption wherever it occurs, and lifting up the poor and marginalized \u2014 even those who sought to steal the nation\u2019s oil.\\r\\n\u201cThis is where he gets into trouble,\u201d said Jaime L\u00f3pez Aranda, a security analyst in Mexico City. \u201cThe poor come first, they are good. But they were basically stealing.\u201d\\r\\nMr. L\u00f3pez Aranda continued: \u201cIf they hadn\u2019t died, it would\u2019ve been a lot more complicated. Then the story would\u2019ve been: Why didn\u2019t you arrest them? You\u2019re supposed to be tough on fuel theft, and these people were stealing fuel. But they died and it changed everything.\u201d\\r\\nIn the days since the disaster, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has generally received high marks for his response to the disaster, and criticism has been notably scarce.\\r\\nHe has been applauded, even by some of his critics, for quickly making himself the face of the government\u2019s response and assuming responsibility.\\r\\nOn Friday, within hours of the accident, he rushed to the municipality where the blast had occurred, met with local officials and spoke with the news media. And since then he has held lengthy, twice-a-day news conferences \u2014 the first at dawn and the other at dusk \u2014 at which cabinet members and other key officials have commented on the emergency and the government\u2019s response.\\r\\n\u201cMexico is hungry for accountability and he\u2019s providing it,\u201d said Viridiana R\u00edos, a visiting assistant professor of government at Harvard University and a columnist for the Mexican daily Exc\u00e9lsior. \u201cIt is refreshing to see him being so hands-on.\u201d\\r\\nMr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s visibility stands in sharp contrast to that of his predecessor, former President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who rarely held news conferences, even in times of national crisis.\\r\\nThat difference is not lost on Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, who has sought in recent days to draw a distinction between his management of the crisis and the approach of prior administrations, emphasizing the importance he puts on accountability and transparency.\\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to conceal anything,\u201d he said at a news conference on Sunday. \u201cOf course, there\u2019s a long history of deceptions, the concealing of truth, and mistrust among the population. We aren\u2019t the same as those who came before.\u201d\\r\\nHe has also insisted that Mr. Gertz, the attorney general, will oversee a thorough investigation into the causes of the explosion and the performance of government officials and of the nation\u2019s security forces responsible for protecting both the pipeline and the population.\\r\\nBut he has also steadfastly refused to implicate the victims. Those who were seeking to nab some free gasoline had approached the pipeline with \u201cthe innocence of thinking that there were no risks,\u201d he said.\\r\\nThe president has instead tried to shift attention to the deep societal problems like inequality and poverty that, he insists, underpin the nation\u2019s crime problem.\\r\\nHe has blamed endemic corruption and the economic policies of past administrations for creating these conditions. \u201cThe people were abandoned, the people were impoverished,\u201d he said on Monday.\\r\\nOn Tuesday, he will unveil a community development program aimed at municipalities where fuel theft is deeply entrenched and where many residents have found work in the illicit industry \u2014 or at least enjoyed the benefit of the black market\u2019s low-cost fuel.\\r\\nMr. L\u00f3pez Obrador also plans to spend Tuesday and Thursday visiting several of these communities to talk about the new development program and implore residents to collaborate in his fight against corruption.\\r\\n\u201cThe must humble people are going to have incomes, they are going to have a way to work honorably without a need for these activities,\u201d he said.\\r\\nMs. R\u00edos commended the president for his approach.\\r\\n\u201cWe need to be empathetic,\u201d she said. \u201cThese were people who saw an opportunity to enrich themselves because the minimum daily wage is equivalent to five liters of gasoline.\u201d In Mexico, where labor is so cheap, she said, \u201cyou should expect something like this to happen.\u201d\\r\\nBut the L\u00f3pez Obrador administration has not been able to completely sidestep criticism.\\r\\nThe performance of the nation\u2019s security forces, in particular, has come under scrutiny.\\r\\nOn Friday, soldiers were dispatched to the scene of the pipeline rupture in the municipality of Tlahuelilpan, yet did not cordon off the area. Officials said the soldiers tried to drive away the crowd, but they were vastly outnumbered and met with hostile resistance, leaving them no option but to stand by idly.\\r\\nThe state oil company, Pemex, is also being scrutinized for possible delays in shutting off the pipeline after the rupture was reported.\\r\\nThe disaster has drawn further scrutiny to Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s strategy for combating fuel theft, which requires a tricky balancing act: He wants to crack down on criminals while making sure the country\u2019s security forces protect ordinary citizens without using too heavy a military hand.\\r\\nAntonio Naval\u00f3n, a political analyst and columnist for the Mexican daily El Financiero, said Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador had \u201cfailed\u201d on this front.\\r\\nThe military\u2019s handling of the throng at the pipeline revealed what he called \u201ca lack of technical capacity and policy,\u201d and said the troops should have been better prepared to handle the situation.\\r\\n\u201cThe circumstances in which the tragedy happened \u2014 where you have massive theft, in the middle of a national battle against fuel theft \u2014 made clear he doesn\u2019t know where to draw the line between protecting people and continuing the fight against the bad guys,\u201d Mr. Naval\u00f3n said.\\r\\nAs part of the crackdown, which was launched in December, the administration shut down oft-targeted pipelines, shifting the transportation of fuel to tanker trucks. But that tactic caused distribution problems and widespread shortages at service stations.\\r\\nSurvivors of the pipeline explosion and other witnesses said some of the victims had gone to the pipeline rupture with their gasoline canisters because shortages had left them without fuel for their vehicles.\\r\\nThe widespread supply problems have left some observers with the sense the L\u00f3pez Obrador administration had launched the crackdown without adequate planning.\\r\\n\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think there is a strategy,\u201d said Mr. L\u00f3pez Aranda, the security analyst. \u201cI\u2019ve become convinced that they\u2019re making it up as they go.\u201d\\r\\nBut the president, whose attack on fuel thieves has enjoyed robust support in recent polling, has vowed to maintain his approach.\\r\\n\u201cI have received a lot of support, many signs of solidarity, and they have expressed to me that I not back down in the fight against corruption,\u201d he said Sunday. \u201cI already made the decision to continue on and cleanse the country of corruption.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-621936301,\"description\":\"President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s response to a blast that killed dozens, many stealing fuel, has exposed a central tension between two of his policy vows: fighting crime and lifting the poor.\\r\",\"title\":\"Mexico Pipeline Explosion Tests New President\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"world.1.txt\"}],\"labelMap\":[[744716624,\"health\"],[-771583032,\"business\"],[-753305417,\"business\"],[-1898459496,\"business\"],[1657028483,\"business\"],[-783835124,\"technology\"],[-476441678,\"business\"],[-445713388,\"business\"],[-1490783143,\"world\"],[788528588,\"world\"],[2035964461,\"health\"],[-1414196775,\"technology\"],[-1413757249,\"business\"],[-2063294509,\"business\"],[-430270314,\"business\"],[-1094504659,\"technology\"],[1589556157,\"science\"],[-713484201,\"world\"],[1827469542,\"business\"],[-394144843,\"technology\"],[-787975219,\"business\"],[-1525035125,\"technology\"],[-621936301,\"world\"],[-782052188,\"science\"],[857785162,\"technology\"],[1261007473,\"health\"],[1446855515,\"business\"],[-1615598764,\"business\"],[-677372880,\"technology\"],[-788369064,\"business\"],[-912019104,\"health\"],[-331952209,\"health\"],[1763094825,\"technology\"],[1691764127,\"technology\"],[-1720052767,\"business\"]],\"confusionMatrix\":[[6,0,0,0,0],[4,1,0,0,0],[1,1,0,3,0],[1,0,0,5,0],[2,1,0,0,2]],\"confusionLabels\":[\"business\",\"health\",\"science\",\"technology\",\"world\"],\"relabelingLabelMap\":[[-1413757249,\"business\"],[-783835124,\"technology\"],[-782052188,\"science\"],[2035964461,\"health\"],[744716624,\"health\"],[1589556157,\"science\"],[-1490783143,\"world\"],[-621936301,\"world\"],[-1720052767,\"health\"],[-912019104,\"world\"],[-713484201,\"world\"],[-242681196,\"health\"],[-677372880,\"world\"],[-1094504659,\"science\"],[-331952209,\"science\"],[-430270314,\"health\"],[1909517249,\"health\"],[-113826969,\"technology\"],[772145717,\"technology\"],[-275112213,\"world\"],[1398502267,\"business\"],[334877764,\"business\"],[-1080452082,\"world\"],[1261007473,\"health\"],[-234580457,\"health\"],[-1948748778,\"world\"],[-787975219,\"health\"],[-259757828,\"health\"],[-929925753,\"health\"]],\"accuracy\":0.6285714285714286,\"correctRelabeled\":[-1413757249,-783835124,-782052188,2035964461,744716624,1589556157,-1490783143],\"labelingPrecision\":0.875,\"labelingRecall\":0.5384615384615384,\"correctAssignedItems\":[-1413757249,-783835124,-782052188,2035964461,744716624,1589556157,-1490783143,-621936301],\"assignmentPrecision\":0.875,\"openedItems\":[],\"numOpenedItems\":0,\"selectedItems\":[],\"selectedInCategory\":0,\"selectionRecall\":null},{\"modelOperation\":\"update\",\"changedFiles\":[{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Sometimes the seemingly small things in life can be major stressors.\\r\\nNobody likes sitting in traffic, for example. According to one study, commuting is one of the least pleasant things we do. But it\u2019s not just an annoying time waster \u2014 there\u2019s a case that it\u2019s a public health issue.\\r\\nAccording to analysis by the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, the average American commuter spends 42 hours per year stuck in rush-hour traffic. In the Los Angeles area, the figure is nearly twice that, equivalent to more than three days. A 2015 Los Angeles Times poll found that among residents of that city, traffic concerns exceed those pertaining to personal safety, finances or housing costs.\\r\\nThe total cost of traffic associated with lost time and wasted fuel exceeds $100 billion per year. As time slips away, idling vehicles add pollution, which has environmental and health consequences, including contributions to climate change.  Long-term exposure to vehicle exhaust is associated with respiratory problems, especially in children. \\r\\nAnother toll is to psychological well-being, stemming from the sense of helplessness we experience in traffic, and its unpredictability. This, too, can be quantified. One study found that to save a minute of time spent in traffic, people would trade away five minutes of any other leisure activity. Another study found that we deal better with the commuting delays that we can anticipate.\\r\\nStressed-out people can take out their frustration on others. We\u2019ve probably all experienced or seen road rage, but aggressive behavior can carry over beyond a commute. \\r\\nA recent analysis of Los Angeles traffic, published in the Journal of Public Economics, documented a link between congestion and domestic violence. From 2011 to 2015, the study found, extreme evening traffic on two major highways \u2014 I-5 and I-10 \u2014 increased the incidence of nighttime domestic violence by about 9 percent.\\r\\nWhat the researchers, Louis-Philippe Beland, an economist at Louisiana State University, and Daniel Brent, an economist at Penn State, mean by \u201cextreme traffic\u201d in their study is best explained with an example: The average evening commute along I-10 for residents of Santa Monica in their study was 45 minutes. Extreme traffic would increase this to 87 minutes.\\r\\n \u201cLife stressors act as emotional cues,\u201d Mr. Beland said. \u201cWhat our work shows is that in extreme cases some people\u2019s responses to those cues can be quite large, leading to violence.\u201d\\r\\nTeaching children how to manage stress and traumatic events from a young age can be important. \u201cThroughout life, mindfulness, healthy eating, sleeping and exercise, and hobbies that blow of steam all help,\u201d said Rebecca Mooney, director of Melrose Alliance Against Violence, which raises awareness about domestic violence and related issues in and around Melrose, Mass.\\r\\nOfficials are not powerless before the problems that stressful commutes can cause. Los Angeles has put in a system that charges solo drivers more to use certain lanes of the I-10 and I-110 highways during periods of heavy traffic. This encourages drivers to move their commutes to less congested times or routes. A study of congestion pricing on Seattle\u2019s SR-520 Bridge found that drivers using the route and its alternatives were less stressed and more satisfied with their commutes after the pricing change.\\r\\nIn addition, many states have been replacing tollbooths with electronic and cashless tolling systems like E-ZPass. More employers are allowing people are working remotely. Troubled transit systems in some cities may be partly behind an increase in car ownership in those areas, but certain West Coast cities are making sweeping expansions of their public transit systems, and many cities are adding bike lanes. \\r\\nThose who can walk or bike to work tend to have a double advantage. Not only do they avoid the harmful consequences of traffic, but they can also improve their health through exercise. Younger people are more likely to prefer that style of commuting, and are driving less than previous generations. \\r\\nThere may be more good news in coming decades for those who loathe gridlock. Although self-driving cars won\u2019t cure traffic woes on their own \u2014 the way that economics-based approaches like congestion pricing can \u2014 they may be able to reduce stress.\\r\\nIf you\u2019re crawling along in traffic and are late to an appointment, but are allowed to take a nap, play video games, watch your favorite TV show or sip on a cocktail, will that reduce your stress? We don\u2019t know for sure, but we look forward to the studies on that. \",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1720052767,\"description\":\"The physical and psychological toll of brutal commutes can be considerable.\\r\",\"title\":\"The New Health Care: Stuck and Stressed: The Health Costs of Traffic\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"health.16.txt\"}],\"labelMap\":[[744716624,\"health\"],[-771583032,\"health\"],[-753305417,\"business\"],[-1898459496,\"business\"],[1657028483,\"business\"],[-783835124,\"technology\"],[-476441678,\"business\"],[-445713388,\"business\"],[-1490783143,\"world\"],[788528588,\"world\"],[2035964461,\"health\"],[-1414196775,\"technology\"],[-1413757249,\"business\"],[-2063294509,\"business\"],[-430270314,\"business\"],[-1094504659,\"technology\"],[1589556157,\"science\"],[-713484201,\"world\"],[1827469542,\"business\"],[-394144843,\"technology\"],[-787975219,\"business\"],[-1525035125,\"technology\"],[-621936301,\"world\"],[-782052188,\"science\"],[857785162,\"technology\"],[1261007473,\"health\"],[1446855515,\"business\"],[-1615598764,\"business\"],[-677372880,\"technology\"],[-788369064,\"business\"],[-912019104,\"health\"],[-331952209,\"health\"],[1763094825,\"technology\"],[1691764127,\"technology\"],[-1720052767,\"health\"]],\"confusionMatrix\":[[5,1,0,0,0],[3,1,0,0,0],[1,1,0,3,0],[1,0,0,5,0],[2,1,0,0,2]],\"confusionLabels\":[\"business\",\"health\",\"science\",\"technology\",\"world\"],\"relabelingLabelMap\":[[-1413757249,\"business\"],[-783835124,\"technology\"],[-782052188,\"science\"],[2035964461,\"health\"],[744716624,\"health\"],[1589556157,\"science\"],[-1490783143,\"world\"],[-621936301,\"world\"],[-1720052767,\"health\"],[-912019104,\"world\"],[-713484201,\"world\"],[-242681196,\"health\"],[-677372880,\"world\"],[-1094504659,\"science\"],[-331952209,\"science\"],[-430270314,\"health\"],[1909517249,\"health\"],[-113826969,\"technology\"],[772145717,\"technology\"],[-275112213,\"world\"],[1398502267,\"business\"],[334877764,\"business\"],[-1080452082,\"world\"],[1261007473,\"health\"],[-234580457,\"health\"],[-1948748778,\"world\"],[-787975219,\"health\"],[-259757828,\"health\"],[-929925753,\"health\"]],\"accuracy\":0.6285714285714286,\"correctRelabeled\":[-1413757249,-783835124,-782052188,2035964461,744716624,1589556157,-1490783143,-1720052767],\"labelingPrecision\":0.8888888888888888,\"labelingRecall\":0.6153846153846154,\"correctAssignedItems\":[-1413757249,-783835124,-782052188,2035964461,744716624,1589556157,-1490783143,-621936301,-1720052767],\"assignmentPrecision\":0.8888888888888888,\"openedItems\":[],\"numOpenedItems\":0,\"selectedItems\":[],\"selectedInCategory\":0,\"selectionRecall\":null},{\"modelOperation\":\"update\",\"changedFiles\":[{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"WELLINGTON, New Zealand \u2014 They dumped chips on someone\u2019s beach blanket.

But a professor who studies tourism trends said the family\u2019s exploits captured New Zealanders\u2019 anxieties about the ballooning number of visitors from overseas.\\r\\n\u201cPeople are viewing it as not necessarily a harbinger of things to come, but it shows our worry about what could happen,\u201d said Simon Milne, a professor of tourism at Auckland University of Technology and the director of the New Zealand Tourism Research Institute.\\r\\n\u201cIt does cut to the heart of a lot of our concerns and our desire to have a clean, green environment,\u201d he said. He added that the pictures and videos of the garbage-dumping, peace-disturbing family had most likely caused some locals to \u201cfeel uncomfortable about our own behavior from time to time.\u201d\\r\\nNew Zealand, which has long marketed its pristine natural wonders and its celebrity status as a stand-in for Middle-earth in \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d films, is experiencing a tourism boom; 3.8 million people visited the country in the yearlong period ending in October 2018, up 1.2 million from five years earlier. The tourism industry expects five million visitors a year by 2024 \u2014 more than New Zealand\u2019s current population of 4.8 million.\\r\\nPopular tourist spots around New Zealand have reported that the local infrastructure cannot handle the tourist influx, forcing the government to scramble to mitigate the damage. Starting later this year, visitors to New Zealand will pay a fee of 35 New Zealand dollars, or about $23, which will be split between conservation and infrastructure. And last October, the fees to stay at huts or campsites in New Zealand\u2019s most popular national parks for hiking were doubled for overseas visitors.\\r\\nJim Boult, the mayor of Queenstown, a popular ski resort town where visitors outnumber locals 34 to 1, said he was glad the government was aware of the problem, but said the new visitor tax \u2014 even if awarded solely to Queenstown \u2014 would not scratch the surface of what tourism was costing the town. He wants a larger, more targeted levy instead.\\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019re the shop window for New Zealand,\u201d he said, referencing photos of the area that he said drove \u201ca large percentage of tourist numbers.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cQueenstown is having to mortgage itself to the hilt for the rest of the country\u2019s benefit,\u201d he said, adding that growing local government debt to finance the area\u2019s rapidly growing infrastructure and accommodation needs were driving up costs for local residents, many of whom struggled to find affordable housing in a pricey rental market catering to wealthy tourists.\\r\\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think that is fair,\u201d he said.\\r\\nThe boom is only expected to continue. In February, New Zealand will introduce a yearlong Chinese tourism initiative; China is the country\u2019s second largest source of tourists after Australia, and the fastest growing. The campaign aims to attract visitors during off-peak times and to lesser-known regions, and also to help businesses better cater to visitors from China.\\r\\nBut Mr. Milne, the tourism professor, said not enough had been done to prepare New Zealand communities for an expected doubling in the number of Chinese visitors. He added that New Zealand had a history of overlooking local residents\u2019 concerns as it sought to aggressively increase tourism.\\r\\nThe British family accused of wreaking a trail of havoc down the North Island over the last month first came to public attention when a woman in Auckland, the country\u2019s largest city, filmed a dispute over the family members\u2019 refusal to pick up trash they had appeared to leave behind at Takapuna Beach in Auckland, New Zealand\u2019s largest city.\\r\\nThree members of the family did not respond to interview requests.

But the intersection of yogi and veteran is natural if unexpected, beginning with the five classic yoga poses known as warriors. \\r\\nWhile veterans make up a small percentage of yoga instructors, their ranks are growing. Many members of the military now often include yoga \u2014 sometimes taught by veterans \u2014 as an element of their workout routine, and veterans turn to the practice for therapeutic applications. The Department of Veterans Affairs has successfully used yoga to help treat opioid addiction and post-traumatic stress.\\r\\n\u201cA lot of vets have post-traumatic stress,\u201d said Thierry Chiapello, who served in the Marines and now teaches yoga at the National Defense University in Washington. \u201cBy lengthening the exhalation of breath, this gets people out of those fight-or-flight instincts that drain you,\u201d he continued, putting them in a mode of \u201crest and recovery that definitely is associated with less aggressive behaviors.\u201d\\r\\nVeterans, long schooled in discipline and concentration, also make excellent yoga teachers, both to other veterans, whose experiences they understand, and to active-duty military members, whose trust they often gain. They are becoming a welcome addition in civilian yoga studios, where students are usually attracted to their compassionate yet frequently no-nonsense approach. \\r\\nHere are some veterans who have become yoga teachers \u2014 from various service branches, eras and parts of the country \u2014 reflecting on the transition.\\r\\nHuntington Beach, Calif.\\r\\nChristian Allaire \\r\\n \u201cThere are huge synergies with the military and yoga,\u201d said Mr. Allaire, who discovered this as he learned yoga. \u201cThere is a stereotype that yogis are a bunch of hippie types of people who are not militaristic,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the whole system of yoga is about moral and ethical restraints on behavior and trying to stay calm in challenging conditions. Sometimes in a pose you feel pain and you have to say, \u2018Is that pain that is damaging or is that discomfort that I need to lean into?\u2019\u201d\\r\\nMr. Allaire teaches hot yoga, a power-driven practice that is popular with veterans because of its athletic nature, and his background shows in how he teaches. \u201cYour commanding officer is your breath,\u201d he said during a recent class in Huntington Beach.\\r\\n\u201cI don't do a lot of chanting,\u201d he said, acknowledging his special style. \u201cI step into class and say, \u2018O.K., folks, get into child\u2019s pose.\u2019 I believe this to be a discipline. Coming in late is not cool and not being serious about your practice is not cool.\u201d\\r\\nHe noted that yoga could benefit people on active duty. \u201cIn order to be skilled at a firearm, you have to be able to control your breathing,\u201d he said. \u201cSpecial Forces people train in breathing techniques all the time. That is one little thing that no one would ever connect.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Allaire experiences the service-driven life of yoga through his work for the Veterans Yoga Project, which provides yoga to roughly 1,000 veterans and their families per week as well as trains prospective teachers. \u201cWe will have four or five people in a conference room at a V.A.,\u201d he said. \u201cThere might be an Iraq war vet in his 20s, a Korean War vet in his 80s, some can barely move, some may be missing limbs and the teacher\u2019s job is to create space for a person to do a twist. Maybe all they can do is raise their hands above their heads, but we are creating a ritual.\u201d\\r\\nBloomfield, Conn.\\r\\nMichael Riley\\r\\n\u201cI teach veteran culture to civilian yoga teachers, which is important,\u201d Mr. Riley said. \u201cWith the V.A. accepting yoga as one of the methods for traumatic brain injuries or PTSD, there are more traditional yoga teachers coming in contact with veterans who may not understand the culture, and there can be some triggering. If I was to describe the average veteran, they are so stuck in their body that they are not really breathing. We teach them to breathe more deeply in their body.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Riley notes that teaching veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder requires precautions. \u201cFor instance, I teach with my back to the door,\u201d he said. \u201cBy allowing veterans to see the door, it gives them a little more ease in their body.\u201d\\r\\nHe added: \u201cAs I move, I try not to move too much. I don\u2019t do a lot of hands-on adjustments. There is a space with vets that I don\u2019t violate. I don\u2019t get too close sometimes, I allow them to feel what is coming up and sometimes it doesn\u2019t feel good and that\u2019s O.K. It is difficult, but you have to sit with it if you really want to heal. You want to just hold space and be able to recognize what is coming up in the moment and see what is my next move. \u201d\\r\\nLike many veteran yogis, he practiced what he now preaches. \u201cWhat I bring when I teach veterans is not just my yoga journey, but how I have been able to weave in other support techniques,\u201d he said. \u201cI have been done great with it. I know it works. Since 2012 when I went to the V.A. and started practicing yoga, my relationship with my children has improved tremendously. But, he noted, \u201cIt hasn\u2019t helped much with my relationships with my exes.\\\"\\r\\nCorpus Christi, TEX.\\r\\nLiz Corwin \\r\\n\u201cI found yoga in flight school in Meridian, Miss.\u201d Ms. Corwin said. \u201cThere was one yoga studio. This is when I found it was such an escape for me because flight school is so intense and they are critiquing everything you do. Nobody knew who I was and nobody cared who I was. I disappeared.\u201d\\r\\nSo what is the difference between teaching yoga to civilians and to active-military members and veterans?\\r\\n \u201cIn the studio I am a bit more esoteric,\u201d she said. \u201cI use a bit more flowy words.\u201d But being a veteran, she added, \u201cabsolutely adds a legitimacy in a competitive, stressful, critical world. They say, \u2018If she can learn to turn her brain off from all the spinning I can, too.\u2019\u201d \\r\\nMs. Corwin\u2019s work taps into the military-civilian divide in the United States. \\r\\n\u201cThe hard thing about teaching in the military \u2014 there is very much either you\u2019re in the military or you\u2019re a civilian,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is really hard as a yoga teacher who hasn\u2019t been in the military to step into that community and immediately garner the trust. When I teach the military, I teach a pretty power-focused class. I tend to hold poses longer and talk more specifically. They tend to like the direction \u2014 there is a sense of safety in the authority that they are used to. But I introduce a playfulness; I curse. I keep it real.\u201d\\r\\nSometimes people are skeptical at first, especially about yoga\u2019s ability to offer the intensity that military workouts entail. \u201cYou invite some humor in and give them something to find their edge with,\u201d Ms. Corwin said. \u201cWithin that community, I can use that different voice. With a bunch of PTSD vets, you wouldn\u2019t take them to those places. My entire intention is how do I get them to walk back into a yoga studio.\u201d\\r\\nNot everyone can get past the perception of yoga, of course. One guy simply had to call it \u201ccombat stretch.\u201d\\r\\nCypress, Tex.\\r\\nAndy Johnson\\r\\nA veteran himself, Mr. Johnson recognizes patterns with yogis, especially men, that he tries to address. \u201cWhat veterans try to do is pull themselves through the practice. It\u2019s the opposite of what you should be doing. I try to really focus on the breathing what would happen if you just let gravity take over,\u201d he explained\\r\\n\u201cMy passion is getting men into yoga and trying to get them connected to themselves, the pain they are feeling and the things they need to let go. It is incredible to see people learn that it is not about getting into the pose,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cSoldiers are very good at being in the moment, much better than I have seen with a lot of civilian yogis. But what I am learning is that it doesn\u2019t matter if you are a former military vet who served four terms in Iraq or a housewife with four kids and anxiety issues. We approach those issues the same way. You think you have all this control in yoga, but it\u2019s not about the control, it\u2019s about kind of letting go.\u201d\\r\\nThe studio attracts veterans, and sometimes it holds special classes, \u201cWarriors in Poses,\u201d focused on them. \u201cIt is a class for veterans taught by a veteran but opened to the entire community,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cI have been told that it is interesting to see a veteran teaching and I think they do appreciate it. I do bring a different point of view to my practice because we had to endure so much regimentation and structure that now I like to break rules.\u201d\\r\\n\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-929925753,\"description\":\"Many members of the military now include yoga \u2014 often taught by veterans \u2014 as an element of their workout routine, and veterans turn to the practice for therapeutic applications.\\r\",\"title\":\"Yoga and Veterans: A Different Kind of Warrior\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"health.18.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"BEIJING \u2014 Warning that China\u2019s arrest of two Canadians has created a dangerous chill for people working on policy and research in that country, more than 100 academics and former diplomats have signed an open letter calling for the two men to be immediately freed.\\r\\nMade public on Monday, the letter was an international cry of concern from people who work and study in China, saying the arrests threaten the flow of ideas with Chinese academics and officials that is essential for policy work and research aimed at narrowing international rifts.\\r\\nThe letter warned China that the detentions will result in \u201cgreater distrust.\u201d\\r\\nIts signatories included 27 diplomats from seven countries and 116 scholars and academics from 19 countries.\\r\\n\u201cMeetings and exchanges are the foundation of serious research and diplomacy around the world, including for Chinese scholars and diplomats,\u201d the letter said.

After a month of relatively mild winter weather, the Midwest and the East Coast are bracing for what is becoming a seasonal rite of passage: the polar vortex.\\r\\nThe phrase has become synonymous with frigid temperatures that make snowstorms more likely. A blast of arctic air heralded the vortex\u2019s arrival on Monday.\\r\\nIf it seems as if these polar freezes are happening more often, you\u2019re right. \u201cThey are definitely becoming more common,\u201d said Jennifer Francis, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Research Center. \u201cThere have been a couple of studies that have documented that.\u201d\\r\\nThe cold snap may feel especially shocking after an unusually warm few weeks. Colder temperatures have been arriving later in winter over the past few years, according to Judah Cohen, a climatologist at Atmospheric and Environmental Research, a weather risk assessment firm. But because of changes to the polar vortex, when wintry weather does arrive, it\u2019s often more intense \u2014 witness the four back-to-back nor\u2019easters last year.\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019ve been making that argument that winter is shortening, but you\u2019re getting these more intensive periods in that shorter winter,\u201d Dr. Cohen said.\\r\\nA major snowstorm pummeled parts of California last week, blanketed the Plains with blizzardlike conditions and dumped snow on the Midwest and East Coast over the weekend. But with the storm cleared out, the effects of a dipping polar vortex have arrived. Monday\u2019s high temperature in New York City is predicted to reach just 16 degrees, 20 degrees below average, according to the forecasting service Weather Underground.\\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019re going into what looks like a pretty unusually cold period, even for late January, punctuated by some winter storms,\u201d said Bob Henson, a meteorologist with Weather Underground.\\r\\nScientists are still trying to figure out why these intense arctic chills are flooding southward more frequently. To understand their thinking, it helps to understand the nature of the polar vortex. While the expression became broadly popular during an unusually cold winter in 2014, the vortex was known to meteorologists long before that.\\r\\nThe term refers to circular bands of winds near the poles that are strongest in wintertime and well above the jet stream in the stratosphere. The stratosphere is an atmospheric layer that extends roughly seven to 31 miles above the earth.\\r\\nUsually, those circular bands act as walls that keep the teeth-chattering cold air locked at the poles. But, every so often, the winds break down and allow the cold air to escape. That\u2019s what happened at the beginning of this month, when the polar vortex split into three separate bands.\\r\\nIt\u2019s this escaping polar air that is dropping temperatures in the Midwest and the East \u2014 there\u2019s a lag time between the atmospheric event and when we experience the effects. The broken vortex is also sending icy temperatures to much of Europe in what some call the \u201cBeast From the East.\u201d\\r\\nSome researchers, including Dr. Francis and Dr. Cohen, say they suspect that the more frequent polar vortex breakdowns can be tied to climate change.\\r\\nWhile climate change is warming the earth, not all parts of the earth are warming at the same rate; the Arctic is warming at a rate twice as fast as the world average. That warming has led to historically low levels of sea ice in the region. The melting sea ice, particularly in an area near the Barents and Kara Seas off Siberia, may be linked to the changes in the polar vortex.\\r\\n\u201cWhen we lose a lot of ice in that particular area in the summer, it absorbs a lot of extra heat from the sun,\u201d Dr. Francis said. This is because the darker open ocean absorbs more heat than reflective ice. \u201cAnd so we see a very persistent, hot spot there in terms of temperature differences from what they should be.\u201d\\r\\nResearch suggests that the hot spot, along with changes in the jet stream driven by climate change, cause the polar vortex to break down in mid- to late winter.\\r\\n\u201cAs the Arctic gets warmer and warmer, the severe weather picks up,\u201d Dr. Cohen said.\\r\\nWhether the polar vortex directly caused the snowstorm is a tricky question, Mr. Henson said. There have always been major winter storms, of course. In this case, the polar vortex, the El Ni\u00f1o pattern and the jet stream flowing from the Pacific all play a role, he said.\\r\\nIn October, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted a milder than average winter, but that is not necessarily at odds with the coming chill.\\r\\n\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between some seasonal outlooks such as NOAA\u2019s that look at the whole three-month period and others that may be breaking it down month by month,\u201d Mr. Henson said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite possible the winter will average warm for December through February. But that may well manifest as the extreme warmth we\u2019ve seen over the last month followed by some much colder and colder than average conditions into February.\u201d\\r\\nFor more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1023035361,\"description\":\"A researcher says that as the climate changes, \u201cwinter is shortening, but you\u2019re getting these more intensive periods in that shorter winter.\u201d\\r\",\"title\":\"Brace for the Polar Vortex; It May Be Visiting More Often\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.17.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"LONDON \u2014 Facebook identified two disinformation campaigns originating from Russia \u2014 including one tied to an agency controlled by the Kremlin \u2014 that were targeted at users in Europe and Central Asia.

Facebook deleted 289 pages and 75 accounts linked to that effort, which also spent about $135,000 on Facebook advertising from 2013 to this month.\\r\\nAbout 790,000 users followed one or more of the pages, and up to 1,200 people expressed interest in attending one of the roughly 190 events organized by those behind the fake pages. Facebook couldn\u2019t say whether any of the events had taken place.\\r\\nThe company said the misleading content aimed to influence people in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Romania, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.\\r\\nFacebook said it had shared information about the investigation with United States authorities, Congress, other technology companies and policymakers in the targeted countries.\\r\\nBen Nimmo, a research fellow at the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank that analyzes misinformation online, said Facebook\u2019s decision to block Sputnik-linked accounts was significant because of the agency\u2019s direct ties to the Kremlin.\\r\\n\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve seen a takedown of this scale linked directly to the national propaganda channel,\u201d said Mr. Nimmo, who was part of a group at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab that had been investigating the Russian campaign separately from Facebook. \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve had something that was so directly traced back to Sputnik itself.\u201d\\r\\nIn Moscow, Sputnik accused Facebook of \u201ccensorship,\u201d saying that the platform had blocked seven pages that belonged to newsrooms in different countries and calling the decision \u201cpolitical,\u201d according to an article by RIA Novosti, another branch of Russia\u2019s propaganda apparatus.\\r\\n\u201cSputnik is dealing with news,\u201d the organization said. \u201cIf blocking is the only reaction Facebook can come up with in response to the quality work of news media, then we have no further questions.\u201d\\r\\nThe statement also said Sputnik hoped that \u201ccommon sense will prevail.\u201d\\r\\nThe Atlantic Council said the pages were a covert attempt to amplify messages from Sputnik, a division of the Kremlin\u2019s media agency, Rossiya Segodnya. All told, the inauthentic network helped Sputnik raise its reach in the countries covered by more than 170 percent, according to the Atlantic Council.\\r\\nMuch of the posted material was innocuous content about weather, fashion and local celebrities, but some presented negative views toward NATO and the treatment of ethnic Russians in Baltic countries. Most of the pages didn\u2019t mention a connection with Rossiya Segodnya or Sputnik.\\r\\n\u201cThis therefore appears to have been an attempt to audience build and draw users\u2019 attention to Sputnik as a media brand rather than to manipulate them with Russian political or geopolitical messaging,\u201d the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab said in a report published separately from Facebook.\\r\\nThe work appeared to be coordinated. On a single day in October 2017, the Atlantic Council said, inauthentic pages seeking to spread Sputnik content were created to focus on Armenia, Chechnya, Estonia, Georgia, Latvia, Lithuania, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. At other points, fan pages purporting to support the presidents of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan were created, but they were actually run from Russia.\\r\\nFacebook also identified a separate effort, discovered after a tip from United States law enforcement authorities, aimed at users in Ukraine, a frequent target of Moscow misinformation campaigns over the four-year confrontation between the two neighboring countries.\\r\\nThe tactics used by those behind the Ukraine-targeted accounts were similar to the misinformation efforts conducted by Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency during the campaign for the recent midterm elections in the United States, Facebook said.\\r\\nThe effort included 107 Facebook pages, groups and accounts, as well as 41 Instagram accounts.\\r\\n\u201cThe people behind this activity coordinated with one another and used fake accounts to misrepresent themselves, and that was the basis for our action,\u201d Mr. Gleicher said of the shutdowns.\\r\\nFacebook has discovered several coordinated misinformation campaigns since the 2016 presidential election, when Russia-linked groups used the social network to reach 126 million users.\\r\\nIn November, Facebook said it had blocked more than 100 Facebook and Instagram posts over concern they were linked to the Internet Research Agency. In August, Facebook also removed 652 fake accounts, pages and groups originating in Russia and Iran that were trying to spread misinformation.\\r\\nThe actions are a shift from when Facebook was widely criticized for failing to detect Russian interference. Facebook executives have said the company is making progress, but also warn of a protracted and challenging battle as groups become more sophisticated at avoiding detection.\\r\\n\u201cGet used to this,\u201d Mr. Nimmo said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just Facebook. It\u2019s going to be all the platforms. This is the new normal.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1138956957,\"description\":\"Facebook removed nearly 500 pages and accounts targeted at Eastern Europe and Central Asia.

It will be the only total lunar eclipse of the year, and that in itself should be reason enough to stay up late and marvel as the moon gets swallowed by Earth\u2019s shadow.\\r\\nYou might have heard that this eclipse is also being called a \u201cSuper Blood Wolf Moon.\u201d But as astronomers know, no number of edgy modifiers could make this display of cosmic clockwork any cooler.\\r\\n[Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.]\\r\\nUnlike a total solar eclipse, when the moon moseys between the sun and the Earth, it\u2019s our planet that slides between the sun and the moon during a total lunar eclipse. As the Earth blocks the sun, only slivers of light make it through the planet\u2019s atmosphere and to the moon.\\r\\n\u201cIf you were standing on the surface of the moon when this event was happening, and you were staring back at the Earth, what you would see is this beautiful reddish-orangish tinted ring,\u201d said Jackie Faherty, an astrophysicist at the American Museum of Natural History.\\r\\nThat ring of light is made up of every sunrise and sunset happening on Earth at that moment in time. It\u2019s the same light that makes the moon look red to those of us on Earth during the eclipse.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho can see the lunar eclipse?\\r\\nThis eclipse will be visible in the night sky across North and South America. Skywatchers in parts of Europe and Africa will see part of or the entire eclipse in their predawn skies.\\r\\nJust before 9:30 p.m. Eastern Time in New York, a bright moon was visible in the sky over Manhattan to the southeast. A weather forecast suggested cloud cover in the area would fall slightly during the time frame of the eclipse. Winter storms and cloudy skies could make viewing the moon difficult in parts of the United States. \\r\\nPeople living in Asia and Australia will not see this eclipse, unfortunately.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen can I see the eclipse?\\r\\nThe opening act starts Sunday night at 9:36 p.m. Eastern Time as the moon first enters Earth\u2019s outer shadow, also called the penumbra. Darkness will creep up the lower left portion of the moon, almost imperceptibly.\\r\\nAt about 10:34 p.m., the moon will start to enter Earth\u2019s inner shadow, or the umbra. This marks the beginning of the partial lunar eclipse, when it will appear as if something took a bite out of the moon.\\r\\nAt 11:41 p.m., the moon will enter totality and turn completely red as it is devoured by Earth\u2019s umbral shadow. It will stay this way for about one hour, and at 12:12 a.m. on Monday, it will reach the darkest part of Earth\u2019s shadow, appearing to be at its most coppery red.\\r\\n\u201cThe moon becomes 10,000 times dimmer than what it was,\u201d said Brian Murphy, director of the Holcomb Observatory and Planetarium at Butler University in Indianapolis. \u201cBecause it is so dim at that point, you\u2019ll be able to see stars right around the moon.\u201d That\u2019s interesting, he said, because full moons tend to be so bright that they outshine stars in their celestial neighborhood.\\r\\nAs it begins to exit the umbral shadow at 12:44 a.m., the moon will start to brighten. By 2:48 a.m., the moon will return to its usual brightness, and the eclipse will be completely over.\\r\\nPeople on the West Coast have a better time slot to watch the show because totality will occur between 8:41 p.m. and 9:44 p.m. Pacific Time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere should I go to watch and what will I need?\\r\\nThat\u2019s the best thing about this celestial show: As long as you\u2019re located on the half of the planet that will experience the eclipse, you can watch it from nearly anywhere, weather permitting.\\r\\nDark skies are always a plus, but your backyard or city street will work just fine. No need for fancy equipment, as your two eyes are all you need.\\r\\nBut if you want to enhance your experience, binoculars will let you better see the whole picture as the moon\u2019s surface changes color.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat if it\u2019s too cold to go outside or too cloudy to see?\\r\\nYou can watch the lunar eclipse online. The Slooh Community Observatory, a telescope broadcast service, will live-stream the event from the Canary Islands and Chile starting around 10:30 p.m. Eastern Time on Sunday. Timeanddate.com will also host a broadcast.\\r\\nWhy is it being called a \u2018Super Blood Wolf Moon\u2019?\\r\\nThis lunar eclipse has been given a name that sounds like it belongs to a heavy metal band. But it\u2019s really all glitter, not gold. So let\u2019s break it down:\\r\\nThe term \u201csupermoon\u201d has come to loosely mean a full moon near perigee, or the point when it is closest to Earth in its elliptical orbit. Normally when this happens, most people can\u2019t tell, as the moon appears only slightly bigger than it does any other night.\\r\\nBut when compared with the moon at apogee, when it is farthest away from the Earth, the differences come into focus. For example, on Monday during perigee, the moon will be approximately 222,040 miles away from our planet, in contrast to Jan. 9, when it was at apogee and about 252,350 miles away. A \u201csupermoon\u201d is about 14 percent larger than one at apogee and 30 percent brighter.\\r\\nBut this term was actually first coined in 1979 by an astrologist named Richard Nolle, not by an astronomer.\\r\\nThis is an embellishment of the coppery-red tint that the moon takes on during any lunar eclipse. Sometimes it\u2019s more brown.\\r\\nNothing to do with werewolves.\\r\\nThe \u201cwolf\u201d title has been attributed to the Native Americans\u2019 name for January\u2019s full moon. According to The Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac, the term comes from the \u201cAlgonquin tribes who lived in regions from New England to Lake Superior.\u201d But this sourcing is suspect.\\r\\n\u201cThe \u2018wolf\u2019 part, it\u2019s almost like this stereotypical, romanticized version of the native culture,\u201d said Annette Lee, an expert in indigenous astronomy at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, who is also mixed-race Lakota.\\r\\nThe term, she said, is an oversimplification that sort of groups hundreds of distinct Native American tribes together into one blob. For example, the Ojibwe tribe \u2014 which historically lived around Lake Superior and is a part of the Algonquin-language family \u2014 called both the month of January and its full moon the \u201cGreat Spirit Moon,\u201d she said. In their language, it is \u201cGichi-manidoo-giizis,\u201d according to Ojibwe.net.\\r\\n\u201cI think the problem with \u2018The Wolf Moon\u2019 is that it takes something that is really important and really meaningful out of its cultural context,\u201d she said. As a result, \u201cit doesn\u2019t have the substance that it needs for people to really learn about the culture in a dignified way.\u201d\\r\\nWhat else is happening in the sky this year?\\r\\nThere are two more \u201csupermoons\u201d on Feb. 19 and March 21 this year, though neither will be a \u201cblood moon.\u201d \\r\\nThere will also be two solar eclipses \u2014 a total solar eclipse visible in parts of South America in July and a year-ending annular, or \u201cring of fire,\u201d eclipse on Dec. 26, which will be visible over the Arabian Peninsula and India.\\r\\nNov. 11 also marks a Mercury transit, which is when people at points on the East Coast can watch the solar system\u2019s innermost planet make a six-hour long trek across the sun.\\r\\n\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":430059624,\"description\":\"You don\u2019t really need to call it a \u201cSuper Blood Wolf Moon.\u201d\\r\",\"title\":\"The Lunar Eclipse and Supermoon: How to Watch It Tonight\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.15.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"I first met my patient, a man in his late 80s, in 2012, when he had been living with myelodysplastic syndromes, a form of bone marrow cancer, for five years \u2014 longer than the average survival for those diagnosed with the condition. He was a former high school math teacher who was unerringly precise about his laboratory values. He also had a spark to him that no cancer could extinguish.\\r\\nOver the years, we had tried a variety of therapies to treat him, some of which worked for a while, some not at all. After our most recent failed attempt to solve the complicated equation of his disease, he had said enough was enough, and asked to be placed on hospice at the nursing facility where he now resided. Fortunately for him, it was one of the few hospice programs that allowed him to continue seeing me to receive the regular blood transfusions that corrected the anemia brought on by his cancer, which eased his fatigue and made him feel more like himself.\\r\\nWhen I entered the examination room, he was wearing an outfit typical of what he sported to many of our visits: a red and yellow tattersall shirt; chinos with a broken button, held closed with a black belt; red Ohio State socks; and tan moccasins. His face was framed by square, dark brown glasses that gave him an air of being more serious than he frequently was.

Now Microsoft, arguing that the industry has an interest and responsibility to help people left behind in communities transformed by the boom, is putting up $500 million to help address the problem.\\r\\nMicrosoft\u2019s money represents the most ambitious effort by a tech company to directly address the inequality that has spread in areas where the industry is concentrated, particularly on the West Coast. It will fund construction for homes affordable not only to the company\u2019s own non-tech workers, but also for teachers, firefighters and other middle- and low-income residents.\\r\\nMicrosoft\u2019s move comes less than a year after Amazon successfully pushed to block a new tax in Seattle that would have made large businesses pay a per-employee tax to fund homeless services and the construction of affordable housing. The company said the tax created a disincentive to create jobs. Microsoft, which is based in nearby Redmond, Wash., and has few employees who work in the city, did not take a position on the tax.\\r\\nThe debate about the rapid growth of the tech industry and the inequality that often follows has spilled across the country, particularly as Amazon, with billions of taxpayer subsidies, announced plans to build major campuses in Long Island City, Queens, and Arlington, Va., that would employ a total of at least 50,000 people. In New York, elected officials and residents have raised concerns that Amazon has not made commitments to support affordable housing.\\r\\nMicrosoft has been at the vanguard of warning about the potential negative effects of technology, like privacy or the unintended consequences of artificial intelligence. Executives hope the housing efforts will spur other companies to follow its lead.\\r\\n\u201cWe believe everybody has a role to play, and everybody needs to play their role,\u201d said Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer.\\r\\nThe company\u2019s strong finances, a sign of its resurgence under Satya Nadella as chief executive, have given it resources to deploy, Mr. Smith said. In October, the company reported net income of $8.8 billion in its most recent quarter, up 34 percent, and it had almost $136 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet. The company\u2019s stock has risen steadily under Mr. Nadella, and Microsoft is now valued at over $800 billion.\\r\\nA number of other tech businesses have tried to address the homeless crisis. Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, has supported homeless service providers through his personal foundation, and the Salesforce chief executive, Marc Benioff, helped fund a proposition in San Francisco to tax businesses to pay for homeless services. Voters approved the tax in November, rejecting opposition from some tech leaders, including Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey.\\r\\nOthers plan to build housing for their own employees. Such housing may help with demand, but it has also reinforced the impression that the companies are focused too closely on their own backyards.\\r\\n\u201cThis is long-range thinking by a company that has been around for a long time, and plans to be around for a long time,\u201d said Margaret O\u2019Mara, a professor at the University of Washington who studies the history of tech companies.\\r\\nMicrosoft began researching the region\u2019s housing last summer, after the nasty tax fight in Seattle and around a peak of the housing market. The company analyzed data and hired a consultant to decide how to focus its work. The area\u2019s home prices have almost doubled in the past eight years, and Mr. Smith said he learned that \u201cthe region has counterintuitively done less to build middle-income housing than low-income housing, especially in the suburbs.\u201d\\r\\nThat squeeze hits a range of workers. \u201cOf course, we have lots of software engineers, but the reality is that a lot of people work for Microsoft. Cafeteria workers, shuttle drivers,\u201d Mr. Nadella said this week at a meeting with editors at the company\u2019s headquarters. \u201cIt is a supply problem, a market failure.\u201d\\r\\nMicrosoft plans to lend $225 million at subsidized rates to preserve and build middle-income housing in six cities near its Redmond headquarters. It will put an additional $250 million into low-income housing across the region. Some of those loans may be made through the federal programs that provide tax breaks for low-income housing.\\r\\nThe company plans to invest the money within three years, and expects most of it to go to Seattle\u2019s suburbs.\\r\\nThe loans could go to private or nonprofit developers, or to governmental groups like the King County Housing Authority. As the loans are repaid, Mr. Smith said, Microsoft plans to lend the money out again to support additional projects.\\r\\nThe remaining $25 million will be grants to local organizations that work with the homeless, including legal aid for people fighting eviction. The Seattle Times reported Wednesday that if the $500 million were put into one project, it would create only about 1,000 units, so instead Microsoft will most likely put smaller amounts in many projects to help build \u201ctens of thousands of units.\u201d\\r\\nThe initial reaction to the company\u2019s announcement was positive.\\r\\n\u201cThere is almost no level of housing that isn\u2019t direly needed,\u201d said Claudia Balducci, a member of the King County Council who helps lead the Regional Affordable Housing Task Force.\\r\\nA report in December by the task force said that the region needs 156,000 more affordable housing units, and will need 88,000 more units by 2040 to accommodate future growth.\\r\\nA growing body of research has tied the lack of affordable housing to increasing homelessness. A December study from the real estate website Zillow said that was particularly true when households pay more than a third of their income in rent. The New York, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle regions \u2014 the country\u2019s largest tech hubs \u2014 have all already crossed that threshold.\\r\\n\u201cThe idea that you can live in your bubble and put your fingers in your ears just doesn\u2019t work anymore,\u201d said Steve Schwartz, head of public affairs at Tableau Software, which is based in Seattle.\\r\\nAmazon in recent years has worked closely with Mary\u2019s Place, a homeless shelter for women and children in Seattle, and is integrating a shelter for about 65 families into one of its new buildings. Amazon has paid tens of millions of dollars to the city\u2019s affordable housing trust fund as fees to build in the core of Seattle.\\r\\nAmazon declined to comment.\\r\\nGoogle supported the City of Mountain View\u2019s plan to add 10,000 housing units in an area it\u2019s developing, with 20 percent designated for lower-income residents. And Facebook has planned to build 1,500 apartments near its Menlo Park headquarters, with 15 percent to be affordable.\\r\\nMicrosoft has begun a major overhaul of its main campus in Redmond, committing billions of dollars in renovations and connecting it to a light rail station under construction. The company helped finance a successful campaign for voters to approve more property taxes to pay for transportation. This new investment in housing takes its commitments a step further.\\r\\n\u201cThis is where Microsoft is going to be, and the region needs to work,\u201d Ms. Balducci said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is wholly altruism.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":772145717,\"description\":\"The move is the most ambitious effort yet by a tech company to fund construction for local teachers, firefighters and other middle- and low-income residents.\\r\",\"title\":\"Microsoft Pledges $500 Million for Affordable Housing in Seattle Area\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"technology.20.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Stocks have staged a remarkable turnaround in the early days of 2019, rebounding after an end-of-the-year tailspin that was fomented by fears of recession in the United States.\\r\\nThree straight weeks of gains in the new year on Wall Street have erased nearly all of 2018\u2019s losses. It\u2019s the best start to a year since 1987.\\r\\nEven so, many factors behind last year\u2019s troubling decline remain unresolved. American companies and consumers are less optimistic about the future, and large economies like Germany and China are signaling a global slowdown driven by the trade war. Britain is in turmoil over leaving the European Union. And a new concern, the longest federal government shutdown in history, also poses a risk to the domestic economy.\\r\\nA month ago, any one of those elements might have fueled a steep decline in stocks. In December, waves of panic-driven selling left the S&P 500 dangling almost 20 percent below its high. Now, it\u2019s all being taken in stride.\\r\\nThe difference is an abrupt change in tone from the Federal Reserve. This year began with repeated public assurances from Fed officials that they were sensitive to concerns about the economy and would be patient and flexible as they decided whether to raise interest rates.\\r\\nInvestors were alarmed last year by the idea that the central bank was determined to keep raising rates, risking a recession. It wasn\u2019t just Wall Street that worried. As stocks were sliding in December, President Trump, who boasted about stocks as they rose earlier in the year, became fixated on the Fed and its chairman, Jerome H. Powell. \u201cThe only problem our economy has is the Fed,\u201d he wrote on Twitter on Dec. 24.\\r\\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying their best to be a source of stability in markets,\u201d said Samantha Azzarello, global market strategist at J. P. Morgan Asset Management. \u201cWhat happened last year really shook people and their confidence in investing in equities.\u201d\\r\\nThe Fed has always held sway over the financial markets, but that influence tends to grow in the later stages of an expansion, when every interest rate increase is seen as the one that might trip up the economy.\\r\\nThe United States economy is still strong: The unemployment rate is near 50-year lows, wages are starting to rise and growth in corporate profits remains robust. To the Fed, these are reasons to keep raising borrowing costs and stave off potential inflation. It did so four times in 2018.\\r\\nBut after 10 years of economic growth, many investors are worried that a turning point is near, and that higher interest rates might bring on a slowdown faster than they expect. And the recent stock market gains may not stick without proof that corporate profits can keep growing.\\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a bit of a \u2018show me\u2019 moment for skeptical and uncertain investors,\u201d said Kate Moore, chief equity strategist for BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest investment firm. \u201cIt\u2019s going to have to be backed up with earnings and the confidence that those earnings are going to be sustainable.\u201d\\r\\nThis past week, American companies began disclosing their sales and profits for the fourth quarter. With about 10 percent of companies in the S&P 500 posting results, the reports have been strong.\\r\\nAfter the S&P 500 rose 2.9 percent in the week through Friday, it is up 13.6 percent from its Dec. 24 low. The stock index ended trading on Friday just below its 2018 starting point.\\r\\nHowever, earnings reports reflect only what happened in the past. When it comes to how they will do in 2019, some large businesses have cautioned that they don\u2019t have a clear view.\\r\\nFord recently warned that the trade war and Britain\u2019s impending exit from the European Union made it impossible to offer investors a forecast. The homebuilder Lennar did the same, blaming weakness and uncertainty in the housing market.\\r\\nBroad surveys of sentiment also suggest reason for worry. On Friday, the University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index fell to the lowest point of the Trump presidency and well below forecasters\u2019 expectations. Earlier in the week, a report from the Fed showed that, through early January, executives and economists had become less optimistic for a host of reasons, including trade and political uncertainty and swings in the financial markets.\\r\\nThe data in that report came before the government shutdown had stretched to nearly a month. Now the longest in United States history, the closing will start to take a toll. The latest estimates from the White House\u2019s own Council of Economic Advisers suggest that the shutdown has already knocked almost half a percentage point off the economy\u2019s growth rate, though that drag should end once the government reopens.\\r\\nThe shutdown is affecting some large businesses already. On Tuesday, Delta Air Lines cautioned that reduced travel by government officials and contractors would hurt its sales growth, at a rate of about $25 million a month. JPMorgan Chase executives noted that if the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 currently closed except for emergency matters \u2014 was not able to give approvals for stock market share offerings, and mergers went unapproved by other government agencies, it could cut fee revenue for its investment banking operations.\\r\\nProfits at American companies may be hurt by the United States\u2019 trade war with China. Evidence that it is slowing global growth mounted this past week, with Germany reporting its slowest annual growth rate since 2013 and China saying that exports fell last month.\\r\\nCompanies in the S&P 500 generate 37 percent of their sales, on average, from markets outside the United States, according to the data provider FactSet, and businesses that have increased their exposure to global economies now look vulnerable.\\r\\nBut for the most part, stock investors have shrugged off these concerns in January, now that they see the Fed as less eager to raise rates.\\r\\nThe Fed had spooked investors as recently as Dec. 19, when it raised interest rates, and its chairman, Mr. Powell, said he didn\u2019t see a need for the central bank to change the way it has been slowly selling off the bonds it bought to bolster the economy over the last decade. The stock market slid 6 percent in the days afterward.\\r\\n\u201cClearly the market was skittish about, primarily, the Fed,\u201d said Alicia Levine, chief strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management. \u201cIt sounded like the Fed was on autopilot.\u201d\\r\\nBy Jan. 4, Mr. Powell\u2019s comments had a different tone. Speaking at a public panel discussion, he made a point of emphasizing the Fed\u2019s ability to be patient with further interest rate increases, given that inflation remains low.\\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019re listening with, you know, sensitively to the message that \u2014 that markets are sending,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to be taking those downside risks into account as we make policy going forward.\u201d\\r\\nWithin days, other central bank officials repeated the sentiment, and the Fed published the details of its December meeting, which showed that many of its policymakers had already reached that conclusion. Stocks had already bounced off their Christmas Eve low when Mr. Powell spoke, but have gained 9.1 percent since.\\r\\n\u201cTheir commentary has really done a 180 in a really short period of time,\u201d said David Giroux, chief investment officer of United States equity at asset manager T. Rowe Price.\\r\\nOver the last 30 years, investors have grown accustomed to looking to the Fed for help when the market found itself in a sticky spot. Some trace the phenomenon to the October 1987 market crash. The morning after stocks tumbled roughly 20 percent in a single day, the Fed, under the recently appointed Alan Greenspan, issued a statement indicating that it was ready to support the economic and financial system.\\r\\nStocks rebounded sharply, helping to embed an expectation into the markets that continues today. And, in the past decade, as stocks have climbed in their longest run of gains ever, the Fed\u2019s decisions to back away from plans to raise interest rates or withdraw economic stimulus have helped keep the bull market alive.\\r\\nMr. Powell and the Fed seem to have done that again.\\r\\n\u201cI think his comments on Jan. 4 were critical to getting excitement and willingness to invest back into the market,\u201d Ms. Levine said.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-81222030,\"description\":\"The year began with repeated public assurances from Fed officials that they would remain sensitive to changes in the economy.

They can only execute popular will, whatever the cost to the country or themselves. To do otherwise would be to betray democracy itself.\\r\\n\u201cThe will of the British people is an instruction that must be delivered,\u201d Prime Minister David Cameron said after voters narrowly approved  leaving the European Union in a 2016 referendum, though this meant both his resignation and, in his telling, devastation to the British economy.\\r\\nYet lawmakers also believe they must determine for themselves how to serve Britain\u2019s best interests. Prime Minister Theresa May, Mr. Cameron\u2019s successor, justified her plan for withdrawal, or Brexit, as the best way forward, even if it was not the most popular.\\r\\nVoters seem to share these dual expectations. The British government, many believe, should first and foremost safeguard the national good, including from the whims of public opinion, which has flipped several times since the initial vote. But it must also respect public opinion, as captured in that nearly three-year-old vote, above all else.\\r\\nThat contradiction \u201cis as old as liberal democracy itself,\u201d said Steven Levitsky, a Harvard University political scientist. But it is growing sharper and more destabilizing, he said, and not just in Britain.\\r\\nAround the world, rising populists and angry electorates are putting pressure, sometimes deliberately, on what Mr. Levitsky called democracy\u2019s \u201ctwo conflicting imperatives: majority rule and liberalism.\u201d\\r\\nIn Western countries, white majorities are challenging rights long promised to minority groups and outsiders. Populist leaders, including President Trump, are clashing with institutions that they say oppose popular will. Political establishments weaken every year.\\r\\nThe result is a widening divide between two visions of democracy. There is the ideal of rule by the people. And there is the more complicated reality, in which institutions and representatives balance majority opinion against considerations like universal rights and the common good.\\r\\nUnable to reconcile those contradictory demands, once solid-seeming democracies are breaking down. Faith in a system that makes two contradictory promises is declining. The resulting chaos, far from elevating one vision of democracy over the other, could weaken both.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Democratic Ideal, and the Reality\\r\\nDemocracy may have begun as the idea that authority comes from the people, but there was always more to it.\\r\\nAs its modern form first took hold, philosophers and revolutionaries debated how to balance several lofty ambitions, of which popular rule was just one. And they fretted over how to make their new system last.\\r\\nThey concluded that democracy could never work as \u201csimply the rule of public opinion,\u201d said Nadia Urbinati, a Columbia University scholar of democracy. It would need \u201crules and procedures\u201d to guard against factionalism, an abusive majority or a power-hungry leader.\\r\\nThey converged on a system in which \u201celections are just one leg,\u201d alongside a second leg of rules, rights and institutions, she said. \u201cWithout that, we don\u2019t call it a democracy.\u201d\\r\\nEdmund Burke, the 18th-century Irish philosopher, argued that an elected leader\u2019s duty required both listening to constituents and putting his or her \u201cmature judgment\u201d ahead of their whims.\\r\\nDuring debates over the American Constitution, James Madison warned in one of the essays that became the Federalist Papers that unbridled majoritarianism had made earlier democracies \u201cas short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.\u201d Only \u201ca republic\u201d of representatives subject to rules and institutions as well as the public, he wrote, \u201cpromises the cure for which we are seeking.\u201d\\r\\nSuch treatises formed the basis of today\u2019s democracies, in which the people\u2019s will is carefully incorporated but rarely intended to dominate.\\r\\nBut that is not quite how this new system won the consent of everyday citizens.\\r\\nThe first democracies built their legitimacy on that of monarchies, then common, with a few proper nouns swapped around. \u201cInstead of having one king, you have a collective king, the people,\u201d Ms. Urbinati said.\\r\\nThat vision of democracy as rule by the people persists, still heard in classrooms and in campaign rallies, where citizens are told that their authority is paramount.\\r\\nIt has set up voters for shock and outrage when they discover, time and again, that they are not as powerful as they\u2019d thought. The checks imposed on popular will can feel like democracy failing \u2014 though it\u2019s actually the system working as intended \u2014 provoking angry backlashes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrexit\u2019s Democracy Problem\\r\\nBrexit is a near perfect encapsulation of this contradiction.\\r\\nMr. Cameron and others sold the 2016 referendum as handing power to the people (never mind that the prime minister, confident that the measure would never pass, was really just looking for a political fig leaf). But it has left Britons more politically disaffected than at any other point in years.\\r\\nMembers of the 48 percent who voted to remain in the European Union have asked why a slim majority should dictate the nation\u2019s fate. Lately, with the polls having turned against Brexit, it can feel like raw majoritarian rule by a majority that no longer exists.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Britons who voted to leave have watched lawmakers fight over widely divergent plans, none of which enjoy majority popular support. There is speculation about a second referendum that might overturn the first, feeding suspicion that the establishment never intended to follow the people\u2019s will.\\r\\nReferendums can end up feeling less democratic than promised in part, political scientists argue, because they are not actually all that democratic.\\r\\nThey tend to be volatile, turning on unrelated political events or even the weather, which is thought to have influenced Colombia\u2019s 2016 referendum on a peace deal with insurgents. They are notoriously poor at reflecting public opinion, particularly on a complex issue like Brexit. And they force majoritarian rule onto a political system that is designed to resist it, setting up voters and leaders for collision.\\r\\nBut even if democracies are not designed for direct popular rule, democracy is often idealized as being exactly that, making it nearly impossible for British leaders to justify ignoring the 2016 vote. Even many who wish to do so are arguing for holding a second referendum, repeating the same risks as in the first.\\r\\n\\r\\nWidening Fissures\\r\\nChallenges to liberal democracy\u2019s checks on popular input are growing globally.\\r\\nIn France, protesters known as the Yellow Vests, not content to defer national policy to Emmanuel Macron, the centrist president, have demanded that the country hold regular referendums on new legislation.\\r\\nThe Alternative for Germany, a far-right party, has also pushed for referendums, including on whether to leave the European Union. Though the party is unlikely to get its wish, merely asking allows it to portray itself as a champion of popular will against an unresponsive establishment.\\r\\nSome elected leaders are governing as if by never-ending referendum, pushing for raw popular will to carry the day.\\r\\nIn the United States, failing so far to get his border wall, President Trump \u2014 as populist leaders often do when institutions stand in their way \u2014 has portrayed Congress as opposing the will of the people. Then he allowed the federal government to be partially shut down.\\r\\nOther populists have taken things further. The ruling party of Poland, after portraying the judiciary as an obstacle to popular will, briefly tried to purge the Supreme Court. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte told the police that they could keep citizens safe only by favoring him over the rule of law.\\r\\nSuch crises are growing more common, Mr. Levitsky argues, because of a shift within democracies.\\r\\nLeaders have always needed the support of both voters and establishments to win elections. Voters wanted popular rule, establishments wanted checks and institutions; the two held each other in balance.\\r\\nBut in recent years a series of changes, including the rise of social media and online fund-raising, have severely weakened establishments\u2019 power.\\r\\n\u201cNow, politicians are learning that they need to be much more responsive to voters than to the establishment,\u201d Mr. Levitsky said.\\r\\nMarginal figures like Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, a longtime lawmaker and now the president, can win by promising to empower popular will over the establishment. That doesn\u2019t have to mean abolishing democratic checks, but it makes doing so far easier.\\r\\nThat can be taken to extremes. A new generation of elected strongmen has risen by exploiting the gap between popular expectations of democracy and its reality.\\r\\nInstitutions and rules really do limit the public\u2019s role. Though they are meant to protect universal rights and the common good, they can be portrayed by populists as an elite conspiracy to subvert the people.\\r\\nThe only way to save democracy, the populists argue, is for a strong leader to smash those institutions and rule directly on the people\u2019s behalf.\\r\\nThis can initially feel liberating to that leader\u2019s supporters. But, as Mr. Madison warned in the Federalist Papers, a democracy imposed \u201cby the superior force\u201d of an \u201coverbearing majority\u201d may not always remain democratic.\\r\\nAnd sooner or later, with the establishment taken care of, strongmen tend to start going after the people themselves.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1631127366,\"description\":\"The checks democratic systems impose on popular will are no accident.

The post showed pictures of her and smiling employees, who number nearly 100. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of what we accomplished in our short time,\u201d she wrote.

She first addressed the scandal at length in an October interview in The Times.\\r\\nMr. Friedman has said he disputes the details in the Times report, but apologized for behavior he said \u201ccan accurately be described at times as abrasive, rude and frankly wrong.\u201d He did not respond to a text message and a phone call seeking comment.\\r\\nThe partners had poured years and millions into transforming the indoor-outdoor space, which since the 1980s had been occupied by a raffish British-style pub, the Cat and Fiddle.\\r\\nThe space was available when the partners were looking to open in Los Angeles and expand their empire. At the time, they owned or ran six restaurants together: the Spotted Pig, the Breslin, the John Dory Oyster Bar, White Gold Butchers and Salvation Taco in Manhattan, and Tosca Caf\u00e9 in San Francisco. Mr. Friedman told L.A. Magazine that he was enamored of the Sunset Boulevard location\u2019s architecture, outdoor space and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll history.\\r\\nThe pub\u2019s original owner, the British bassist Kim Gardner, had played with bands such as the Birds, and made the Cat & Fiddle a music industry haunt, known for its relaxed smoking policy and proper English pints.\\r\\nMr. Friedman, who grew up in Los Angeles and worked in the industry for years before branching out into restaurants, said he had spent \u201ca few debauched mornings\u201d at the Cat & Fiddle in the 1980s.\\r\\nHe is now the sole owner of the Spotted Pig in the West Village of New York, where several women say they were subjected to sexual misconduct by him and by Mr. Batali, a regular and investor. Mr. Batali was the subject of an New York Police Department investigation into accounts of sexual assault in the restaurant\u2019s private party space.

He was a former high school math teacher who was unerringly precise about his laboratory values. He also had a spark to him that no cancer could extinguish.\\r\\nOver the years, we had tried a variety of therapies to treat him, some of which worked for a while, some not at all. After our most recent failed attempt to solve the complicated equation of his disease, he had said enough was enough, and asked to be placed on hospice at the nursing facility where he now resided. Fortunately for him, it was one of the few hospice programs that allowed him to continue seeing me to receive the regular blood transfusions that corrected the anemia brought on by his cancer, which eased his fatigue and made him feel more like himself.\\r\\nWhen I entered the examination room, he was wearing an outfit typical of what he sported to many of our visits: a red and yellow tattersall shirt; chinos with a broken button, held closed with a black belt; red Ohio State socks; and tan moccasins. His face was framed by square, dark brown glasses that gave him an air of being more serious than he frequently was. His son sat by his side.\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019m honored to be in the presence of such musical greatness!\u201d I joked with my patient. \u201cI should have brought a Sharpie marker with me to get your autograph.\u201d\\r\\nHe smiled and his son started to chuckle. My patient had just sung in a concert at the hospital near his nursing facility, showcasing performances by him and six other patients. He had been participating in a music therapy program for over a year.\\r\\nI am a firm believer in the ability of music to help people express their emotions, hopes and fears, making their medical conditions more tolerable. In one study, patients undergoing a bone-marrow transplant were randomized to participate in a music therapy program or receive standard medical care. Those who received music therapy needed fewer narcotic pain medications than those receiving the usual care.\\r\\n\u201cWere you able to see a video of the show?\u201d his son asked as he brought out his phone. I shook my head, and he scrolled through his files until he found the one he was looking for and pressed play.\\r\\nOn the screen, my patient sat tall in a black wheelchair with a high back, wearing a blue dress shirt and bow tie. A microphone hovered in front of him, and a music therapist strummed a guitar softly by his side.\\r\\nHe started in on \u201cSentimental Journey,\u201d the song originally sung by Doris Day with Les Brown and His Band of Renown in the mid-1940s, when my patient was entering his teenage years.\\r\\nGonna take a sentimental journey\\r\\nGonna set my heart at ease \\r\\nGonna make a sentimental journey \\r\\nTo renew old memories \u2026\\r\\nHis voice started out a bit tremulous and unsure, but gathered strength as the song progressed, with some vibrato and huskiness adding depth to the words, as if he were living them in real time.\\r\\n\u201cYou sound incredible,\u201d I told him. His eyes danced with delight. \u201cYou must have done this before.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cOnly in a church choir,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in a men\u2019s quartet for a bit when I was younger.

The police in Guernsey, an island in the Channel, said only two people were aboard, but there were unconfirmed news reports of an additional passenger.\\r\\nMr. Fitzgerald said it was unclear why the aircraft had disappeared. \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether it was system failure,\u201d he said.\\r\\nThe Piper Malibu plane \u2014 a single-engine, propeller-driven aircraft \u2014 departed Nantes, a city in western France, at 8:15 p.m. local time \u2014 7:15 in Britain \u2014 on Monday, headed for Cardiff, the capital of Wales.\\r\\nBy 8:23 p.m. in Britain, it had disappeared from air traffic control radar, about 15 miles north of Guernsey, the Guernsey police said in a statement.\\r\\n\u201cThe aircraft on passing Guernsey requested descent,\u201d the Guernsey police said.\\r\\nThey did not say why the pilot would have wanted to descend so far short of the destination, but Mr. Fitzgerald speculated that it could have been to avoid freezing conditions and precipitation.\\r\\n\u201cThey were possibly trying to get underneath the weather,\u201d he said.\\r\\nThe plane was flying at an altitude of 2,300 feet when it lost contact.\\r\\nA search-and-rescue operation started Monday evening, and British and French helicopters, airplanes and search craft took part in the search on Tuesday.\\r\\nThe plane\u2019s disappearance could be the second air-related tragedy for the Premier League in a short span. Less than three months ago, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, the owner of Leicester City, died when his helicopter crashed as it was leaving the stadium.\\r\\nMr. Sala, a 28-year-old forward from Argentina, enjoyed a rapid rise to prominence relatively late in his career. At one point this season, playing for Nantes in the French league, he had scored more league goals than any other Argentine player in Europe\u2019s major leagues \u2014 a list that includes the likes of Paulo Dybala of Juventus, Mauro Icardi of Inter Milan, and Lionel Messi of Barcelona.\\r\\nMr. Sala left his homeland for Europe at the age of 16. After attracting attention from several teams in England and Spain, he was initially recruited to join the youth development system at Girondins de Bordeaux, spending time on loan to Orleans, Niort and Caen as a teenager.\\r\\nIn 2015, he signed with Nantes for 1 million euros, more than $1.1 million.\\r\\nHe proved to be a reliable, if unspectacular, striker \u2014 the \u201csort you do not see much any more,\u201d according to his current coach, Vahid Halilhodzic.

Desperate for some offensive power, the team ranked next-to-last in scoring among the 20 Premier League teams, and had played a converted defender as its main striker for much of the season.

It\u2019s a normal egg, brown, with freckles, nothing special. It could\u2019ve been the egg you\u2019ll eat for breakfast this morning. Instead, it hatched an internet phenomenon, for reasons no one can explain.\\r\\nSay what you will about that egg and those who cared about it. But in a week when much of the world seemed so mired in acrimony, it was a small (very small) symbol of what collective effort can do. Speaking of accomplishments, prepare for the week ahead with the top stories in business and tech, below. Then go enjoy an omelet.\\r\\nJan. 13-19\\r\\nWhat\u2019s Up?\\r\\nPresident Trump\u2019s government shutdown continues, and the household budgets of federal employees are hurting. Some 800,000 haven\u2019t been paid in weeks, and a typical furloughed worker is now about $5,000 behind in salary. Thousands have filed for unemployment. They\u2019ve cut back on spending and investing, which is taking a serious bite out of the country\u2019s economic growth. On a warmer note, some thoughtful souls have been offering free pizza, wine, financial services and even homemade casseroles to unpaid workers across the country. Still, none of these gestures can substitute for a paycheck.\\r\\nRemember the ex-partner at Goldman Sachs who helped steal $2.7 billion from a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund, spending his share on designer bags and diamond necklaces? Though Goldman tried to distance itself from the scandal, it recently earmarked $516 million to cover potential penalties. Nevertheless, the bank beat analysts\u2019 expectations with a sunny earnings report on Wednesday. The fourth-quarter numbers of other big banks were mixed, breaking a yearlong streak of the industry\u2019s record profits. But in light of the market\u2019s plummet in December, they are still doing better than some analysts predicted.\\r\\nSkyrocketing living costs have made many tech-centric cities, particularly on the West Coast, inaccessible to teachers, firefighters and pretty much anyone else who isn\u2019t making a fat salary. In Seattle, Microsoft is trying to stem that exodus by putting up $500 million to finance affordable homes. While some say the pledge is too little, too late, it\u2019s still the most ambitious step that any tech company has taken to solve the housing crisis of its own making.\\r\\nJan. 20-26\\r\\nWhat\u2019s Next? \\r\\nIt\u2019s Groundhog Day across the pond. By Monday, Prime Minister Theresa May must cobble together a new plan for Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union. As predicted, Parliament resoundingly struck down her proposal last week \u2014 but, hey, she kept her job despite a no-confidence vote the next day. A no-deal Brexit, which could wreak havoc on the British economy and its trading partners, looks more and more likely. Some companies are starting to brace themselves; the deadline is less than 10 weeks away.\\r\\nWho started the opioid epidemic? A Massachusetts court will hold a status hearing this week in a case that contends the Sackler family, owner of the company that makes OxyContin, should be held partly accountable. The business, Purdue Pharma, has already paid hundreds of millions of dollars in fines for misrepresenting the dangers of the painkiller, which was once marketed as having an addiction risk of \u201cless than 1 percent\u201d (nope). Sackler family members have claimed to be unaware of such practices, but evidence in a court filing by the Massachusetts attorney general suggests that they were more involved than they let on. Purdue Pharma said in a statement that the filing was \u201clittered with biases and inaccurate characterizations.\u201d\\r\\nThere will be some notable absences at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week. Mr. Trump canceled the United States delegation, citing a need to keep his administrators in Washington during the government shutdown. Mrs. May has also bowed out (see above). This year\u2019s forum was supposed to focus on rising tensions between world powers and the possibility of a full-blown global trade war. But with major players missing in action, how far will they get?\\r\\nWhat Else?\\r\\nCrooks: They love the internet. Facebook uncovered two more Russian-backed misinformation campaigns and deleted more than 500 pages and accounts as a result. Meanwhile, two men were charged with hacking into the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s database to steal secrets that fetched about $4.1 million in illegal profits. In other news, the pop star Rihanna is teaming up with the luxury conglomerate LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton to start a fashion brand. She\u2019d be its first female designer of color.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat Counts\\r\\n$13: The new cost of Netflix\u2019s most popular streaming plan. The monthly fee was increased by $2 last Tuesday for new subscribers, while existing users won\u2019t see the upcharge for a few months. The company attributed its higher rates to one simple reason: It takes a lot of money to create quality content.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-621199876,\"description\":\"With some pressing domestic matters, President Trump and Prime Minister Theresa May won\u2019t be heading to Davos.

Cohen, to lie in his testimony to Congress \u2014 a felony \u2014 the assertion ricocheted around the cable TV ecosystem and into the halls of Congress, where Democratic lawmakers publicly mused on impeachment.\\r\\nUnlike past articles on the possible ties between Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Russia, however, this one was not followed by similar stories from other news organizations, who proved unable to corroborate its findings with reporting of their own. And on Friday, the office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, broke precedent by issuing a denial, interrupting nearly 20 months of silence from Mr. Mueller on news reports swirling around his investigation.\\r\\nWhether BuzzFeed\u2019s reporting can stand up to further scrutiny is now at the center of a test of the news media\u2019s credibility. President Trump seized on the special counsel\u2019s denial to continue making the case that the press is biased against him. Journalists expressed the worry that a retraction could undermine Americans\u2019 trust in their work.\\r\\nBuzzFeed News said on Saturday that it remained confident in the article and its two authors, one of whom won a Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting in 2016. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have published it if we hadn\u2019t felt comfortable with it,\u201d Ben Smith, the site\u2019s editor in chief, said in an interview. \u201cWe were careful and thorough.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Trump, speaking to reporters at the White House on Saturday, called the article \u201ca disgrace to our country.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a long time for the mainstream media to recover its credibility.\u201d\\r\\nThe episode underscored the risks and temptations that go with reporting on the legal labyrinth of Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation, the outcome of which may help determine the fate of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.\\r\\nBuzzFeed\u2019s findings were attributed to two unnamed federal law enforcement officers with knowledge of the special counsel\u2019s investigation. One of the reporters, Anthony Cormier, said on CNN that he had not reviewed the underlying documents, but that the two sources had, and they were \u201cfully, 100 percent read-in to that aspect of the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Cormier and his co-writer, Jason Leopold, have written well-received investigative articles on Mr. Trump and a Moscow tower project that involved President Vladimir Putin of Russia. The latest piece, though, was more dramatic in reporting that Mr. Trump had instructed Mr. Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow project and that Mr. Mueller\u2019s office was aware of this conduct.\\r\\nThe BuzzFeed article was the talk of TV pundits and news websites for 24 hours \u2014 until Peter Carr, Mr. Mueller\u2019s spokesman, weighed in. Mr. Carr, whose stoicism is so well-known in Washington that he has the nickname \u201cMr. No-Comment,\u201d wrote: \u201cBuzzFeed\u2019s description of specific statements to the special counsel\u2019s office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen\u2019s congressional testimony are not accurate.\u201d\\r\\nSeveral reporters who cover the Justice Department said they interpreted the statement as a full denial of BuzzFeed\u2019s conclusions. Mr. Smith, in the interview, said the wording of Mr. Carr\u2019s statement was imprecise, adding that he was \u201ceager to understand\u201d which specific aspects of the article the special counsel\u2019s office had denied. Asked if the statement had caught him by surprise, Mr. Smith replied, \u201cYou always have to be ready for everything in this business.\u201d\\r\\nBuzzFeed News, the reporting division of a website better known for viral videos and quizzes, has scrambled for respect and recognition since its founding eight years ago. Under the direction of Mr. Smith, a longtime political journalist, the site has pursued ambitious stories. Last year it was a Pulitzer Prize finalist for an inquiry into the deaths of Russians in England, which Mr. Leopold worked on.\\r\\nBuzzFeed\u2019s longtime investigative editor, Mark Schoofs, left in October for an academic post at the University of Southern California. His replacement, Heidi Blake, who is based in London, edited the Cohen piece, along with Mr. Smith and Ariel Kaminer, a senior investigations editor, both of whom are based in New York.\\r\\nThis is not the site\u2019s first brush with controversy. In January 2017, Mr. Smith was the first editor to publish the explosive, but unverified, dossier compiled by the former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele during the 2016 campaign. Besides earning ire from the White House, and some scolding from media ethicists, the site was also sued for libel by Mr. Cohen in a case that was later dropped. Last month, a federal judge ruled in favor of BuzzFeed in a separate dossier-related lawsuit.\\r\\nMr. Leopold, who is based in Los Angeles and known for his mastery of Freedom of Information laws, has a self-described \u201ccheckered past\u201d in journalism that includes retracted reporting and accusations of plagiarism. In 2006, he reported for TruthOut.org, a liberal website, that Karl Rove, a senior adviser to then-president George W. Bush, would soon be indicted; the story proved false. Mr. Leopold has also spoken openly about his recovery from addiction. Asked about Mr. Leopold\u2019s past, Mr. Smith pointed to his Pulitzer Prize nomination last year.\\r\\nThe contentiousness over the recent BuzzFeed article is unlikely to abate soon.\\r\\nIts central assertion pleased many liberals impatient for Mr. Mueller to release his findings. Democratic lawmakers were quick to write on Twitter that, \u201cif true,\u201d the article\u2019s findings could lead to impeachment. In covering the reaction to its own scoop, BuzzFeed ran the headline, \u201cMore And More Democrats Are Suggesting Trump Should Be Impeached After He Told His Lawyer Michael Cohen To Lie To Congress.\u201d\\r\\nThe cold water of Mr. Carr\u2019s denial led some journalists to cringe on-air in real time. \u201cThis is a bad day for us,\u201d the CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said on Friday, after his network had devoted many segments to dissecting the piece. \u201cIt reinforces every bad stereotype about the news media.\u201d\\r\\nThe president\u2019s son, Donald J. Trump Jr., a relentless media critic, responded in his own way, on Twitter: \u201cHahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!\u201d\\r\\nOne side effect of the BuzzFeed article was that it made for a rare moment of agreement between the president and the man who has been investigating him.\\r\\n\u201cI appreciate the special counsel coming out with a statement,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters on Saturday. \u201cI think it was very appropriate that they did so. I very much appreciate that.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":216869378,\"description\":\"\u201cWe were careful and thorough,\u201d says Ben Smith, the site\u2019s editor in chief, after the special counsel and President Trump himself knock down a big story.\\r\",\"title\":\"BuzzFeed News Faces Scrutiny After Mueller Denies a Dramatic Trump Report\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"business.23.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Aisha Harris, assistant TV editor for The Times, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.\\r\\nWhat\u2019s your setup for watching the TV shows or movies you review? What could be better about it?\\r\\nMuch of my TV and movie consumption for work involves screeners, which are sent out to the press ahead of release. For TV, these screeners are almost always in digital form, via the network\u2019s press site or a link sent by email, so I usually watch those on my laptop. On the rare occasion I\u2019m not feeling too lazy \u2014 or if it\u2019s a show, like \u201cHomecoming,\u201d that really rewards viewing on a bigger screen \u2014 I\u2019ll hook up my laptop to my TV. If I\u2019m unable to attend a press screening in person for a movie I\u2019m reviewing, I\u2019ll review the DVD at home on my TV.\\r\\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I recently upgraded our home entertainment setup, with a 50-inch 4K Amazon Fire TV. We also own a Sonos soundbar and a two-room Sonos Play:1 wireless speaker set that sounds incredible. \\r\\nThe only downside is that the wireless speakers have been cutting in and out for some time when paired with our TV. Troubleshooting on our own thus far hasn\u2019t yielded great results, and the tech support hours coincide with when we\u2019re at work. It\u2019s a fairly common problem, according to the multiple message boards I\u2019ve stumbled upon, so I\u2019m hoping someone can help us find a quick, easy solution soon.\\r\\nHow has your setup for watching TV and movies changed over time?\\r\\nWhen I moved to New York in my early 20s for graduate school, my roommates and I had a common area with a TV, but I rarely used it. I was the millennial who saw no need for cable anymore once I could stream almost everything I wanted, and I was content viewing primarily on my laptop. With rare exception, I never had time for or cared enough to watch shows while they aired live, so finding it online later was my go-to.\\r\\nI still don\u2019t have cable, but I do have pretty much every major streaming service there is \u2014 Netflix, Hulu Live (which is basically cable), HBO, Showtime, Amazon and, once upon a time, FilmStruck (R.I.P.).\\r\\nStreaming services like Netflix and Hulu give you tons of options for programs to watch. The downside is that it feels impossible to decide what to watch. How do you pick a program to watch?\u00a0\\r\\nThe short answer: I keep a running list of movies and shows I want to eventually see on my Notes app (it\u2019s very long and never-ending), and when I\u2019m able to watch something that isn\u2019t directly work related, I consult the app and choose whatever fits my mood.\\r\\nThe long answer is that often none of the titles on said list fit my mood in the moment. This conundrum is almost as maddening to me as having a case of severe writer\u2019s block. To put it bluntly: There have been times when, after flipping through the various services and perusing the latest \u201cnew to streaming\u201d articles online, I suddenly look at the clock and realize that 90 minutes have passed. I\u2019ve watched nothing! I could have had a brand-new movie viewing experience in that time. Or binged approximately four episodes of \u201c30 Rock.\u201d\\r\\nActually \u2014 almost as embarrassing as wasting so much time merely trying to decide what to watch is the fact that I usually wind up just rewatching something I\u2019ve already seen a million times, like \u201c30 Rock\u201d or \u201cThe Twilight Zone.\u201d\\r\\nRelated: How do you determine which shows or movies are worth writing about? \\r\\nThe \u201cworthiness\u201d of a show or a movie when it comes to coverage can be baked in: the names involved, the subject matter (Is it adapted from a wildly popular book series? Are our writers and critics excited about it?), the network or platform it\u2019s appearing on. Social media plays a part, too, however \u2014 if something not initially on my radar is getting a lot of buzz on Twitter, I\u2019ll at minimum check it out and see what it\u2019s all about.\\r\\nIn the past, cord-cutting was an impractical option because people missed out on live sports or broadcast news. What\u2019s the situation today?\\r\\nI have zero interest in live sports or broadcast news \u2014 I get most of my news from online and via my daily RSS feed. (I\u2019ve been using Feedly for years.) But it seems absolutely possible to not have cable and still be a sports fan and news junkie, especially because of Hulu Live or digital media players like Amazon Fire and Roku. Of course, you just wind up substituting one cord for a bunch of separate cords in this case \u2014 I\u2019m probably paying nearly the same amount I would be if I had a cable bundle.\\r\\nOutside of work, what tech product are you currently obsessed with?\\r\\nA recent addition to my home is the Eufy RoboVac 30C. We have hardwood floors and a dog that sheds, which has made keeping the floor relatively clean a nearly impossible task. But this has done a good job reducing the amount of dust I find on the bottom of my socks.\\r\\nI\u2019m fairly certain it\u2019s listening in on our conversations, and my dog scampers to the other side of the room or jumps on our bed when it passes near her, but I love it.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":979802475,\"description\":\"Our assistant TV editor has a state-of-the-art setup for watching shows and movies.

But their great girth, which coaches encouraged and which helped turn some players into multimillion-dollar commodities, leaves many of them prone to obesity problems.\\r\\nIn retirement, these huge men are often unable to lose the weight they needed to do their jobs. Without the structure of a team and the guidance of coaches for the first time in decades, many of them lose the motivation to stay in shape, or cannot even try, as damage to their feet, knees, backs and shoulders limits their ability to exercise. \\r\\nThis is a big reason that former linemen, compared with other football players and the general population, have higher rates of hypertension, obesity and sleep apnea, which can lead to chronic fatigue, poor diet and even death. Blocking for a $25-million-a-year quarterback, it turns out, can put linemen in the high-risk category for many of the ailments health experts readily encourage people to avoid. \\r\\n\u201cLinemen are bigger, and in today\u2019s world, rightly or wrongly, they are told to bulk up,\u201d said Henry Buchwald, a specialist in bariatric surgery at the University of Minnesota who works with the Living Heart Foundation, a nonprofit organization that provides free medical tests to former N.F.L. players. \u201cTheir eating habits are hard to shed when they stop playing, and when they get obese, they get exposed to diabetes, hypertension and cardiac problems.\u201d\\r\\nMany linemen say they were encouraged by their high school and college coaches to gain weight to win scholarships and to be drafted by the N.F.L., where a lot of players were required to become even bigger. In some cases, players were converted from tight ends to down linemen, and needed extra weight to play the new position. Coaches often leave it up to the players to decide how to gain weight. \\r\\nJoe Thomas, an All-Pro lineman with the Cleveland Browns, said that as a freshman in college he ate every few hours to gain the 40 pounds he needed to get to 290 pounds. He gobbled burgers, frozen pizzas and large bowls of ice cream. \u201cIt was see food, eat food,\u201d Thomas said.\\r\\nThe Living Heart Foundation has examined several thousand former players since it was formed in 2001 with financial backing from the N.F.L. players\u2019 union. About two-thirds of those players \u2014 not just linemen \u2014 had a body mass index above 30, which is considered moderately obese. A third of those screened were at 35 or above, or significantly obese. The index, which is viewed as a general indication of weight relative to size, does not take into account muscle mass. \\r\\nLinemen have been getting heavier, faster. From 1942 to 2011, they have gained an average of three-quarters of a pound to two pounds a year, about twice the average gain for all N.F.L. players, according to a study published in The Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research.\\r\\nAnother study showed that the average weight of offensive linemen ballooned 27 percent, from 249 pounds in the 1970s to 315 pounds in the 2000s, as the passing game evolved. \\r\\nThe consequences can be dire. A study published in The American Journal of Medicine found that for every 10 pounds football players gained from high school to college, or from college to the professional level, the risk of heart disease rose 14 percent compared with players whose weight changed little during the same period.\\r\\nPlenty of linemen do lose weight. The former linemen Matt Birk and Nick Hardwick shed dozens of pounds after retiring and publicized their achievement. Thomas, who retired last year after 11 seasons with the Browns, gained roughly 30 pounds after entering the N.F.L. He has since lost about 50 pounds by eating less and eating healthier.\\r\\n\u201cI reversed everything I was doing,\u201d said Thomas, who weighed about 320 pounds in the N.F.L. \u201cNo more freezer pizzas before bed. I dialed back the carbs, added whole grains, couscous, quinoa.\u201d\\r\\nThe N.F.L. and the players\u2019 union, recognizing more must be done, offer retired players medical exams, health club memberships and other services. Dozens of retired players, for instance, get free health screenings at the Super Bowl.\\r\\nStill, many players are unreachable, said Archie Roberts, a former N.F.L. quarterback and retired heart surgeon who started the Living Heart Foundation. \u201cIf you don\u2019t guide players through it, they won\u2019t show up. If we can\u2019t get them to follow through, they won\u2019t get the health care they deserve.\u201d\\r\\nDerek Kennard: Sleep Apnea\\r\\nMany former linemen said they woke to the dangers of being obese when the Hall of Famer Reggie White died in 2004 of cardiac arrhythmia. White also had sleep apnea.\\r\\nLinemen are prone to the affliction, in which a person\u2019s breathing repeatedly stops and starts because the muscles in their neck press against the breathing passage as they sleep. This cuts off the flow of oxygen and wakes the player, often for a second or two. The continual sleep interruptions can make it difficult for those with sleep apnea to feel fully rested.\\r\\nFormer linemen have big necks, and as they age their throat tissue becomes flabby, so their tongues can block their airways, said Anthony Scianni, a dentist who runs the Center for Dental Sleep Medicine, which works with former N.F.L. players.\\r\\nThe lack of oxygen, Scianni said, stimulates the body to produce more sugars, which can cause Type 2 diabetes and lead to overeating and other problems.\\r\\nDerek Kennard, a guard for 11 seasons with the Cardinals, the Saints and the Cowboys, has battled to reverse this cycle. He snored so loudly \u2014 a common symptom of sleep apnea \u2014 that his roommate in his last season asked for a different room. After Kennard retired in 1996, the years of sleep deprivation led to other problems. He ate poorly and gained 100 pounds. He took Vicodin to deal with the pain of his football injuries. The pain, lack of sleep and extra weight made it difficult to exercise. His cholesterol levels and blood pressure jumped. He would fall asleep behind the wheel while stopped at traffic lights.\\r\\n\u201cYou\u2019re not sleeping well, so your body is not healing itself,\u201d said Kennard, whose son Devon is a linebacker for the Lions. \\r\\nAfter his brother died in 2009, Kennard, who is 6-foot-3 and whose weight peaked at 465 pounds, sought help. He was tested for sleep apnea and was told he woke 77 times per hour. One episode of not breathing lasted 1 minute 32 seconds. Because he flips in bed as he sleeps, Kennard had trouble wearing the mask of a CPAP machine, which delivers continuous positive airway pressure and is the standard treatment for sleep apnea. He switched to a mouthpiece that kept his airways open. He now wakes just twice an hour, and sleeps about seven hours a night. His weight fell to about 350 pounds, and he stopped taking painkillers.\\r\\n\u201cA hundred pounds came off quickly because I had energy to do exercise,\u201d he said at a conference for retired players in Phoenix, where he lives. \\r\\nKennard urges other former players to be checked for sleep apnea, and tries to convince them that wearing a mask does not make them weak.\\r\\n\u201cI had so much death in my life, I could see it in front of me,\u201d he said.\\r\\nVaughn Parker: Overeating, a Constant Battle\\r\\nVaughn Parker, a tackle who played 11 years, mostly with the Chargers, struggled with overeating, and after a dozen surgeries on his shoulders, ankles and triceps, he had a hard time exercising to shed weight. \\r\\nHe also got busy. Parker invested in real estate in San Diego until the market collapsed in 2008. He had two children, split with his wife and studied for an M.B.A., which he finished in May 2017. The stress led him to eat more, and before he knew it, he had added 90 pounds to his 6-foot-3 frame and weighed more than 400 pounds. \\r\\n\u201cEveryone has their cross to bear,\u201d said Parker, 47, who also has high blood pressure. \u201cFor some people, it\u2019s gambling or alcohol. For me, it\u2019s food.\u201d\\r\\nIn 2013, Parker received a phone call from Aaron Taylor, a former teammate, who encouraged him to work out with other retired N.F.L. players who received free gym memberships from the Trust, a group started by the N.F.L. and the players\u2019 union to assist retirees.\\r\\nParker started driving 40 minutes to Carlsbad, north of San Diego, several times a week to EXOS, a high-end fitness club, where a trainer tailored workouts to his abilities and injuries. Afterward, the handful of former players discussed their progress and drank nutritional shakes. They learned about portion control and shopping for healthy food. Parker knew he had lost his best chance to become fit, which is right after retirement, but he tried to catch up.\\r\\n His workouts were exhausting, but he stuck with the program, in part driven by the camaraderie of the other ex-players, and shed nearly 100 pounds the first year. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a day I didn\u2019t sit at the edge of my bed and say I\u2019m not going today,\u201d Parker said. \\r\\nKeeping the weight off has been a challenge. At home, he drinks protein shakes and eats made-to-order meals. But he also likes sugary drinks, and eating healthily on business trips has been tough. When he dines out with friends, he eats nachos, chicken wings and fried foods.\\r\\nBut the prospect of cascading health problems motivates Parker to keep exercising. He recently re-enrolled in a six-week training program at EXOS.\\r\\n\u201cHow many 400-pound offensive linemen are walking around in their 50s?\u201d he said.\\r\\nJimmie Giles: Avoiding Surgery, Managing Pain\\r\\nLinemen are not the only players who need to keep the pounds on to play their position. Tight ends and linebackers often do as well.\\r\\nThat was true for Jimmie Giles, who because of his size and soft hands was one of the best blocking tight ends of his day. Nearly 30 years after he retired, Giles, who lives in Tampa, Fla., where he starred for the Buccaneers, checks in at roughly 350 pounds, about 100 pounds above his playing weight.\\r\\nAfter 13 years in the N.F.L., ending in 1989, he had done lasting damage to his back, knees and feet. He had regular headaches, the result of about a dozen concussions. When he retired he took up golf to stay in shape. But the effects of his football injuries added up, limiting his activity. He had four degenerative disks in his back and no feeling in his right leg, and he had sleep apnea. His inability to exercise exacerbated his problems.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I gained 100 pounds right away,\u201d he said.\\r\\nTo relieve the pain in his back, Giles received five epidurals a year, an ordeal he gave up when he started taking painkillers. But they can be highly addictive and caused sluggishness.\\r\\n\u201cThat\u2019s not living \u2014 that\u2019s surviving,\u201d Giles said in his family\u2019s insurance office in Tampa.\\r\\nAbout two years ago, Giles quit taking painkillers. He now receives cortisone shots instead. He said he does not even take aspirin \u201cbecause I want to know when I hurt.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cAs long as I\u2019m at a 5 out of 10 in terms of pain, I\u2019m all right,\u201d he added.\\r\\nGiles, though, has put off back surgery for as long as possible, wary of the side effects. Every six months or so, he also receives radio frequency epidurals to deaden the nerves in his left leg, where he suffers shooting pain. \\r\\nGiles\u2019s father died from a heart attack, and his brother, who had congestive heart failure, is also dead. So Giles, who receives disability benefits from the N.F.L., regularly visits doctors to keep his high blood pressure and other vital signs in check.\\r\\nLosing weight has been difficult. He rode a bicycle until it affected his prostate. Now he swims for an hour several times a week. He tries to eat moderately, and he avoids sweets and breads.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for him,\u201d his wife, Vivian, said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the food \u2014 it\u2019s the injuries.\u201d\\r\\nDavid Lewis: Diabetes, Heart Condition\\r\\nWhen David Lewis played linebacker in the 1970s and early 1980s, he was 6-foot-4 and weighed 236 pounds. Like many other players, he was pushed out of the game by injuries.\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019ve had sprains, broken knuckles, hyperextended elbows, nerve problems in my neck, shoulders,\u201d Lewis, 64, said. \u201cI\u2019d be guessing how much concussions I had.\u201d\\r\\nBy about 40, he was receiving disability payments, and he has qualified for the 88 Plan, a league and union benefit that pays for medical care for players with dementia, including Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s. \\r\\nUnable to run or exert himself much, he now weighs about 300 pounds.\\r\\n\u201cAs time went on, all the sickness started to add up,\u201d he said.\\r\\nThe sickness includes Type 2 diabetes, a kidney ailment and a congested heart from hypertension. He receives iron transfusions to correct a deficiency. He takes a half-dozen pills each day.\\r\\nAside from taking medicine, combating those problems has not been easy. Lewis said he needed a knee replacement which should allow him to exercise more. But he said he could not have the surgery because of his heart condition.\\r\\nHe goes to a Y.M.C.A. to walk on the treadmill and ride a stationary bicycle. He has also tried to eat healthier, like dropping sausages in favor of oatmeal, egg whites and fruit.\\r\\nThis has helped him lose about 30 pounds this year and ease the stress on his knees and back.\\r\\nLewis knows he has to keep moving. Metabolically, the more weight you have, the harder it is to lose weight because the fat cells replicate, said Rudi Ferrate, a doctor who helps players with sleep apnea. \u201cWe\u2019re designed to store energy,\u201d he said.\\r\\nWillie Roaf: Injuries Accumulate\\r\\nWillie Roaf knew it was time to retire in 2005. After 13 years at left tackle with the Saints and the Chiefs, he was destined for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, which he entered in 2012. Many of the 189 games he played were on unforgiving turf, and his body was breaking down.\\r\\nRoaf, 48, tore his hamstring and had back and knee injuries, episodes of gout, a staph infection and periodic lymphatic swelling in his leg. Prediabetic, meaning his blood glucose levels were higher than normal, he was determined to keep his weight down and went to the gym after he retired. He weighed about 320 pounds, similar to during his playing career.\\r\\nBut within a few years, he became less mobile. Doctors told him he had spinal stenosis, a narrowing of the spinal canal. In 2013, a doctor told him he had the back of a 70-year-old. He had surgery to relieve pressure on the sciatic nerves. He wanted to keep the pounds off, but working out was difficult.\\r\\n\u201cI can\u2019t do anything more than stretching,\u201d he said in his Florida kitchen.

For years, no orca born into this group has survived.\\r\\nThe calf, known as L124, is part of a group of orcas known as the Southern Residents. The group has been shrinking for decades \u2014 it had nearly 100 orcas in the mid-90s, and now has 75 \u2014 in large part because of a depletion of its main food source, the Chinook salmon. Pollution and noisy boat traffic also appear to be hastening the group\u2019s decline.\\r\\nSince no calves born to the group since 2015 have survived to maturity, researchers are crossing their fingers for L124.\\r\\n\u201cI wish I could say that the odds are good, but unfortunately, the Southern Residents aren\u2019t doing too well right now,\u201d said Melisa Pinnow, a biologist with the Center for Whale Research, a nonprofit group in Washington State. \u201cIn the last three years, every calf that\u2019s been born has died, and we\u2019ve had miscarriages as well.\u201d\\r\\nAnother calf from the same group made headlines around the world after it died last year and its mother, known as J35, carried its small body on her nose for 17 days in an unusually long show of grief.\\r\\nThe new calf was discovered last week. Ms. Pinnow was watching Seattle news coverage of the killer whales on Thursday when she thought she saw a small addition to the extended family. Shortly after dawn the next morning, she and three other researchers set out in a boat to investigate. They found the baby swimming with its family in Admiralty Inlet, at the north end of Puget Sound.\\r\\n\u201cIt looked like a normal calf, just kind of bebopping around between its mother and its uncle and its older sister,\u201d Ms. Pinnow said, adding that it seemed to be at least three weeks old.\\r\\nIt is still unclear whether L124 is male or female, said David Ellifrit, another biologist on the trip. \u201cHopefully it\u2019s a female, because we need more reproductive-age females,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd hopefully it will continue to grow and thrive.\u201d\\r\\nOrcas, one of the world\u2019s most powerful predators, are found in all of the world\u2019s oceans. Some groups are thriving, but others \u2014 especially those that live near industrialized areas, like the Southern Residents \u2014 are suffering from pollution and environmental degradation. Polychlorinated biphenyls, a variety of biochemicals known as PCBs, have been found to linger in the blubber of killer whales, and mothers can pass those toxins onto their offspring.\\r\\nThe Southern Residents are divided into three pods \u2014 J, K and L \u2014 each with its own dialect of call sounds. The new calf is a member of the L pod, which now has 35 killer whales in all.\\r\\nThe groupings follow matrilineal lines; grandmothers live with their daughters and their daughters\u2019 offspring. Older females go through menopause, just like humans, and after that they often help their daughters take care of the calves.\\r\\nThe orcas are social and can be playful, but only when they have time to play. These days, searching for food keeps them more busy than it used to.\\r\\nBut on Friday morning, some of them seemed to be in a happy mood; researchers saw members of the L pod doing spy hops, pec slaps and cartwheels. Later in the day, all three pods gathered together in the same space. That was a rare sight for the researchers, Ms. Pinnow said. But this party was a little dull \u2014 nothing like the more playful, interactive gatherings these orcas used to have decades ago.\\r\\nMs. Pinnow added that J35, the one that carried her dead calf last year, appeared to be doing all right, even if she was perhaps a little mopey. J35 might soon lose her mother, J17, who is hungry and visibly weak.\\r\\nIn a group of mammals with such tight family bonds, the fertility problems could be distressing, Mr. Ellifrit said.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019d be like living in a tiny little town where nobody knows why all the kids are dying,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody knows each other, but they\u2019re just dealing with this kind of premature death, over and over and over.\u201d\\r\\nHe called the birth of L124 \u201ca bright spot, for sure.\u201d\\r\\nSaving this group of orcas from extinction would be a complex undertaking. Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington established a task force last year that reported on ways to increase the salmon population and fight noise and chemical contamination.\\r\\nMs. Pinnow recommended a range of things that people could do to help the Southern Residents, including supporting the breaching of nearby dams, banning net pens of farmed salmon and cutting back on salmon consumption over all.\\r\\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have too much longer to dillydally before they go extinct,\u201d she said.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1741665359,\"description\":\"The newborn killer whale, called L124, looks healthy.

A jury found Huawei guilty in May 2017.\\r\\nThe criminal inquiry is looking at some of the same issues as the civil case, according to one of the people with knowledge of the investigation.\\r\\nA Huawei spokesman declined to comment Wednesday evening, as did a spokesman for T-Mobile. The investigation was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\\r\\nThe inquiry in Seattle is unrelated to the federal government\u2019s efforts to extradite Meng Wanzhou, Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer, who was arrested in Canada at the request of the United States in early December.\\r\\nFederal prosecutors believe Ms. Meng, a daughter of Huawei\u2019s founder, misled banks about Huawei\u2019s business in Iran, causing them to violate American sanctions on Iran inadvertently. She has been living under surveillance in Canada while the authorities decide whether she will be extradited to the United States.\\r\\nSeparately, Huawei last week fired an employee who was arrested in Poland and charged with spying for the Chinese government. The employee, Wang Weijing, had worked at the Chinese Consulate in Gdansk, Poland, before joining Huawei in its public relations and sales departments. The company fired him a day after his arrest was announced and said his actions were unrelated to the company.\\r\\nTaken together, the cases underscore the United States intelligence community\u2019s primary fears about China and its largest companies. Law enforcement officials have long said that Chinese companies and state-sponsored entities steal trade secrets to bolster China\u2019s economy and corporations and that companies close to Beijing will break laws to advance the government\u2019s political goals.\\r\\nLawmakers are also pressuring Huawei. A new bill introduced on Wednesday would ban the export of American technology to Chinese telecommunications companies that have broken U.S. sanctions, including Huawei and its smaller Chinese rival ZTE.\\r\\nBecause the companies make wide use of an array of American parts, like microchips, the bill could have a major impact on their business. A similar ban last year, following a finding that ZTE had violated American sanctions, effectively shut the Chinese company down before the Trump administration lifted it.\\r\\n\u201cBoth companies have repeatedly violated U.S. laws, represent a significant risk to American national security interests and need to be held accountable,\u201d said Chris Van Hollen, a Democratic senator from Maryland and one of the sponsors of the bill, in a statement.\\r\\nThe bill, called the Telecommunications Denial Order Enforcement Act, was also sponsored in the Senate by Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas. In the House of Representatives, it was sponsored by Mike Gallagher, a Wisconsin Republican, and Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat.\\r\\nThe charges in Seattle had hung over Huawei for much of last year, as various other crises were unfolding for the company. The charges were due to pass the statute of limitations last year, but the case was extended.\\r\\nIn plea negotiations last year, Huawei faced the prospect of pleading guilty to a criminal charge of theft of a trade secret and agreeing to some sort of compliance plan, according to one of the people who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\\r\\nIf the case is resolved with a plea agreement, Huawei will most likely plead guilty to a criminal charge of theft of a trade secret and have to agree to some sort of compliance plan, the person said.\\r\\nHuawei is a banner for immense national pride in China. But the United States has long eyed the company with suspicion. Large American cellular carriers have shunned Huawei\u2019s gear for many years.\\r\\nPressure on the company has risen sharply over the last year. The authorities in Britain, the Czech Republic, Canada and elsewhere have taken a more critical look at Huawei as mobile carriers prepare to upgrade the technology in their networks. Australia has already barred the company from providing equipment to support its fifth-generation, or 5G, wireless networks.\\r\\nHuawei executives have longed denied that the company acts on behalf of any government. But American counterintelligence agents and federal prosecutors have for some time explored possible cases against the company\u2019s leadership.\\r\\nThe T-Mobile lawsuit was not the first time Huawei had been accused of stealing intellectual property. In 2003, the company admitted it had stolen portions of the software that runs computer networking equipment from Cisco Systems, one of the largest tech companies in Silicon Valley.\\r\\nCisco dropped a patent infringement lawsuit in exchange for a promise from Huawei to modify some of its products.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1896161526,\"description\":\"The inquiry grew out of a 2014 civil suit and appears unrelated to other pressure faced by the Chinese company, two people familiar with the case said.\\r\",\"title\":\"Huawei Said to Be Under U.S. Investigation in Trade-Secrets Case\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"technology.21.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"(Want to get this briefing by email?

Something like it happens to plants when they are under attack, too. And then there are fungi \u2014 perhaps the most mysterious kingdom of multicellular life.\\r\\nFungi too can sense attackers and manufacture powerful weapons to combat them, including the toxins and poisons that can send you to the emergency room if you eat the wrong mushroom.\\r\\nBut little is known about the built-in threat detectors of these limbless, brainless beings. Humans send messages through their nervous systems. A plant\u2019s vascular system is its relay apparatus. But fungi have neither.\\r\\nScientists trying to solve this mystery recently grew mushrooms in the lab, unleashed fungi-eating nematodes on them and videotaped the aftermath. They found that the fungi somehow sensed the predators and sent signals to other parts of their bodies. Their findings, published recently in Current Biology, shed new light on how the many cells within even primitive organisms communicate like plants or animals.\\r\\n\u201cThey may appear simple, but they share features that are also known for more complicated organisms,\u201d said Markus K\u00fcnzler, a microbiologist at ETH Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland who led the study. \u201cThere is internal communication going on that we know very little about.\u201d\\r\\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\\r\\nWhat we do know is that fungi-loving nematodes ingest their dinner like creepy, syringe-wielding serial killers. The worm uses a needle on its head to puncture the mushroom\u2019s hyphae \u2014 the stringy filaments that make up its mycelium, or vegetative body \u2014 and suck out its cellular content.\\r\\nUnder attack, Coprinopsis cinerea, the mushroom commonly known as the \u201cgray shag\u201d or \u201cinky cap\u201d and often used in fungi research, puts up a slow, but steady fight.\\r\\nDr. K\u00fcnzler and his colleagues paired the fungi and nematodes in a lab setting, and also added a dye to the mushrooms that glows under a microscope. They watched the mushroom\u2019s response travel in the form of genes activating, lighting up as its warning message propagated up and down the fungus\u2019s fattest hyphae. It did so every few hours \u2014 and it switched directions. As they switched on in succession, the genes produced a nasty toxin the nematodes don\u2019t like.\\r\\nIt makes sense that to survive, a fungus would need to send defense signals throughout its body rather than only at the site of attack. For example, defending its reproductive caps above the soil, even preemptively, would help its legacy continue.\\r\\nBut much remains unknown about the fungus\u2019s signal and how it travels.\\r\\n\u201cIn both plants and animals, electrical and chemical signaling is known,\u201d Dr. K\u00fcnzler said. \u201cIt\u2019s not very clear what happens in the fungus.\u201d\\r\\nFungal architecture is quite different from that of plants and animals. Dr. K\u00fcnzler\u2019s results suggest that the cells within a fungus\u2019s hyphae communicate using chemical signals, but additional research will be required to confirm the finding.\\r\\n\u201cWe think the signal has to travel from one cell to another across the cytoplasm of the cells, which is very special or different from how the signaling is done in a plant or animal body,\u201d he said.\\r\\nWhile fungi may be simple compared with animals and plants, they\u2019re multicellular too, and what\u2019s the point of making all those cells stick together if they can\u2019t somehow communicate?\\r\\n\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1094504659,\"description\":\"A mushroom species was found to sense predators and sent warning signals to other parts of its body, but how it does that remains a mystery.\\r\",\"title\":\"Trilobites: When Fungi Fight Back\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.6.txt\"}],\"labelMap\":[[744716624,\"health\"],[-771583032,\"health\"],[-753305417,\"world\"],[-1898459496,\"business\"],[1657028483,\"business\"],[-783835124,\"technology\"],[-476441678,\"business\"],[-445713388,\"business\"],[-1490783143,\"world\"],[788528588,\"world\"],[2035964461,\"health\"],[-1414196775,\"technology\"],[-1413757249,\"business\"],[-2063294509,\"business\"],[-430270314,\"world\"],[-1094504659,\"science\"],[1589556157,\"science\"],[-713484201,\"world\"],[1827469542,\"business\"],[-394144843,\"technology\"],[-787975219,\"business\"],[-1525035125,\"technology\"],[-621936301,\"world\"],[-782052188,\"science\"],[857785162,\"science\"],[1261007473,\"world\"],[1446855515,\"business\"],[-1615598764,\"business\"],[-677372880,\"world\"],[-788369064,\"business\"],[-912019104,\"world\"],[-331952209,\"world\"],[1763094825,\"technology\"],[1691764127,\"technology\"],[-1720052767,\"health\"],[-929925753,\"world\"],[189579811,\"business\"],[1023035361,\"world\"],[-1138956957,\"technology\"],[430059624,\"science\"],[-242681196,\"health\"],[772145717,\"technology\"],[-81222030,\"business\"],[-1631127366,\"technology\"],[-2008072080,\"world\"],[996113641,\"science\"],[-621199876,\"business\"],[115072823,\"world\"],[216869378,\"business\"],[979802475,\"technology\"],[951101460,\"science\"],[-259757828,\"science\"],[-1741665359,\"world\"],[-1896161526,\"business\"],[-204444614,\"business\"]],\"confusionMatrix\":[[8,1,0,0,1],[2,0,1,0,4],[1,0,3,0,3],[1,0,0,8,1],[4,0,1,1,1]],\"confusionLabels\":[\"business\",\"health\",\"science\",\"technology\",\"world\"],\"relabelingLabelMap\":[[-1413757249,\"business\"],[-783835124,\"technology\"],[-782052188,\"science\"],[2035964461,\"health\"],[744716624,\"health\"],[1589556157,\"science\"],[-1490783143,\"world\"],[-621936301,\"world\"],[-1720052767,\"health\"],[-912019104,\"world\"],[-713484201,\"world\"],[-242681196,\"health\"],[-677372880,\"world\"],[-1094504659,\"science\"],[-331952209,\"science\"],[-430270314,\"health\"],[1909517249,\"health\"],[-113826969,\"technology\"],[772145717,\"technology\"],[-275112213,\"world\"],[1398502267,\"business\"],[334877764,\"business\"],[-1080452082,\"world\"],[1261007473,\"health\"],[-234580457,\"health\"],[-1948748778,\"world\"],[-787975219,\"health\"],[-259757828,\"health\"],[-929925753,\"health\"]],\"accuracy\":0.6,\"correctRelabeled\":[-1413757249,-783835124,-782052188,2035964461,744716624,1589556157,-1490783143,-1720052767,-912019104,-1094504659],\"labelingPrecision\":0.7142857142857143,\"labelingRecall\":0.45454545454545453,\"correctAssignedItems\":[-1413757249,-783835124,-782052188,2035964461,744716624,1589556157,-1490783143,-621936301,-1720052767,-912019104,-713484201,-242681196,-1094504659],\"assignmentPrecision\":0.7142857142857143,\"openedItems\":[],\"numOpenedItems\":0,\"selectedItems\":[],\"selectedInCategory\":0,\"selectionRecall\":null},{\"modelOperation\":\"update\",\"changedFiles\":[{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"\\n\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-331952209,\"description\":\"Ants use their antennas to sniff out food, and other ants.

But deep down, you\u2019re not sure where to start. Sure, you can buy accounting software, sign up for a service or poke around your bank\u2019s online offerings for money management. But don\u2019t overlook what is probably the best option of all: a simple and free spreadsheet you make yourself.\\r\\nNever used spreadsheet software before and not quite sure what it does? Relax, using it to make a budget is easy, because someone has already done most of the work. Here\u2019s how to get started.\\r\\nStep 1: Pick Your Program\\r\\nFirst, select an application that can create and edit spreadsheet files. Microsoft Excel has long been a core component of the Microsoft Office suite for Mac and Windows ($70 a year). If you don\u2019t have it already, you can also find versions for Android and iOS or the free basic version that runs in a web browser.\\r\\nOther free or preinstalled spreadsheet programs may already be on your device. Google Sheets (for Android, iOS and web) and Apple\u2019s Numbers software for iOS, macOS and web are two examples.\\r\\nIf you don\u2019t care for the offerings from Microsoft, Google or Apple, there are alternatives. Apache OpenOffice has a Calc spreadsheet program, as does LibreOffice, and both are free open-source suites that run on Windows, Mac and Linux systems. And there are plenty of other options in the app stores if you want to shop around.\\r\\nStep 2: Select a Template\\r\\nSpreadsheet programs for home computers have been around for 40 years, giving developers plenty of time to make them more intuitive. Most have a version of the \u201cpersonal budget\u201d template \u2014 with the spending categories, design and formulas already formatted. Take advantage of them. Just type over the sample numbers with your own information and the software does the math.\\r\\nOpen your program of choice and look for the \u201cTemplate\u201d or \u201cProject\u201d gallery. Select the template that best matches your needs, like \u201cMonthly Home Budget,\u201d to create a new spreadsheet.\\r\\nDon\u2019t see a template that suits you? With a quick search, you can find plenty more to download online, like the selection at BudgetsAreSexy.com, which has specialized templates for those aiming for early retirement, or recent college graduates. The Measure of a Plan personal finance site also has a detailed budget-tracking template that works in Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets. Online video tutorials and software guides can also help you build your own spreadsheets.\\r\\nStep 3: Enter Your Own Numbers\\r\\nOnce you open a template, you\u2019ll see the boxes (called \u201ccells\u201d in spreadsheet lingo) to fill in your own numbers. Gather up pay stubs, bills, statements and any other forms that show what you made or spent that month.\\r\\nEnter the information into the designated place. Along with your salary, your pay stub should show the money taken out for things like taxes, retirement savings and health insurance. Add in monthly expenses, like phone, credit card and power bills; car loans; gas, insurance, rent and mortgage costs; gym fees; restaurant meals; and shopping sprees.\\r\\nStep 4: Check Your Results\\r\\nOnce you have all your numbers punched into the spreadsheet, you can see two things. First, you have a line-by-line accounting of your finances for the month.\\r\\nSecond, most spreadsheet templates give you added totals in your columns for income and expenses, so you can see your cash flow in action. Some templates even include charts to help you better visualize your situation.\\r\\nStep 5: Keep Going or Move Up to a Specialized App\\r\\nIf using a simple spreadsheet to record your monthly budget inspires you to keep tracking it over the year \u2014 or take even more control \u2014 you can move up to a dedicated tool that shows spending trends, provides financial coaching and offers tips.\\r\\nWirecutter, a product review site owned by The New York Times, has a roundup of budgeting apps and tools to recommend, like the YNAB (You Need a Budget) service ($84 a year, but with a free trial period available); Mint.com and others are also reviewed.\\r\\nNo doubt, being diligent and updating your chosen budgeting tool takes time and effort, but it pays off.

However, great artists of anger have taught us how cathartic a rousing roar can be, especially when the object of rage is not a conjured scapegoat but a clear and present danger. One of the greatest of those artists in living memory \u2014 the singer, pianist, composer Nina Simone \u2014 lambasted the disasters of American racism.

In doing so, she has emboldened me to recycle some of her stanzas for people from diverse backgrounds who live with cancer.

The Ghosts of Teouma\\r\\nA faint aura of destiny seems to hover over Teouma Bay. It\u2019s not so much the landscape, with its ravishing if boilerplate tropical splendor \u2014 banana and mango trees, coconut and pandanus palms, bougainvillea, the apprehensive trill of the gray-eared honeyeater \u2014 as it is the shape of the harbor itself, which betrays, in the midst of such organic profusion, an aspect of the unnatural. The bay, on the island of Efate in the South Pacific nation Vanuatu, is long, symmetrical and briskly rectangular. In the expected place of wavelets is a blue so calm and unbroken that the sea doesn\u2019t so much crash on the land as neatly abut it. From above, it looks as though a safe harbor had been engraved in the shoreline by some celestial engineer.\\r\\nIn late 2003, while clearing land just above the seaside, a bulldozer driver found a broken piece of pottery in the rubble. The villagers of Vanuatu often happen upon shards of timeworn ceramic, which spark an idly mythical curiosity; they\u2019re said to be fragments of Noah\u2019s Ark, or the original Ten Commandments, or the burst water vessels of powerful ancestral spirits. These shards are often left alone, but word in this particular case traveled quickly, and the artifact soon found its way to the Vanuatu Cultural Center and National Museum, where Stuart Bedford, a New Zealand archaeologist who had studied local pot shards for years, was called in to inspect it. He immediately recognized its distinctive pattern \u2014 \u201cdentate stamping,\u201d an ancient technique so named because it looked as though some tiny-toothed creature had bitten an intricate pattern into the ceramic \u2014 and understood that this pottery coincided with the very first movement of ancient peoples into the South Seas.\\r\\nBedford rushed to the site of the discovery, an old colonial coconut plantation that the bulldozer had been clearing for use as a prawn farm. Further burrowing turned up not only more pottery but also tools of obsidian and a great cache of human bones, which had lain undisturbed and unusually well preserved over thousands of years. The site was soon identified as the oldest and largest prehistoric cemetery ever found in the Pacific. Everything at the site indicated a founding colony \u2014 first arrivals to the shores of uninhabited islands. Teouma was, according to Bedford, \u201cunlike anything anyone had ever seen, or was likely to see, in this part of the world ever again.\u201d\\r\\nArchaeologists hoped the bones might help provide a clue to the abiding mystery of how anybody had gotten to these far-off coastlines in the first place. Vanuatu is a volcanic archipelago of more than 80 islands littered in an extended slingshot shape across an 800-mile arc of the South Pacific. Europeans first heard of its existence in 1606, when a Portuguese navigator stopped through on a brief but violent imperial errand for the Spanish crown. The islands were largely left to their own devices until the end of the 18th century, when French and British ships arrived to plant their own flags. The two countries ruled the archipelago as a joint colony, called the Condominium of the New Hebrides, until independence was achieved in 1980. National coherence remains a work in progress. By some measures, Vanuatu is per capita the most linguistically diverse country on the planet: Its quarter-million citizens, predominantly the native ni-Vanuatu, speak as many as 140 different indigenous languages and maintain an astonishing variety of cultural practices. A meaningful national identity has been constructed from a common appreciation of ceremonial pig-tusk bracelets and the taking of kava, a very mild narcotic root that looks like primordial pea soup and tastes like a fine astringent dirt. Above all, however, the ni-Vanuatu are bound together by the fact of the country\u2019s nautical isolation: Their nearest neighbors are hundreds of miles in any direction.\\r\\nIt is the peculiar geography of this isolation that made the Teouma site so significant. Many of the islands of the South Pacific are much farther-flung: Easter Island makes Vanuatu look like an Australian exurb. But with one very small exception \u2014 the tiny eastern outliers of the Solomon Islands \u2014 Vanuatu offers the first solid ground on the far side of a major but invisible maritime boundary. On the west side of that border is a string of archipelagoes called Near Oceania: islands chained to one another (and to the rest of the world) by lines of sight. Prehistoric peoples, after tens of thousands of years of travel by foot from Africa, had arrived at the end of Southeast Asia and hopscotched their way forward via short sea outings, presumably crossing the narrow channels they encountered on crude watercraft. Finally, however, some 40,000 years ago, their path was decisively blocked by open ocean. In front of them, across more than 200 miles of empty sea, was the vast aquatic wilderness of Remote Oceania.\\r\\n[5 takeaways from this report on ancient DNA research.]\\r\\nThat border marked the absolute limit of human expansion for tens of thousands of years, until at last someone sailed out across the naval event horizon and into the unknown. This first traversal was one of the greatest and most courageous passages in human prehistory. The peopling of Remote Oceania \u2014 an obscure exodus that easily ranks among the signal triumphs of the ancient world \u2014 has inspired awe and vexation for generations. In the mid-20th century, archaeologists came to identify these first voyagers with a set of jars and tools unique to the region, the \u201cLapita cultural complex,\u201d and determined that they crossed the boundary into Remote Oceania some 3,000 years ago. Further details were presumed lost to history.\\r\\nBut in 2014, Bedford got another surprise call, this time from a researcher affiliated with a genetics team at Harvard. A small group of pioneering lab scientists had found ways to isolate and analyze DNA from ancient bones, methods potent enough to inspire a wholesale revision of our knowledge about ancient peoples. The Harvard operation, which was then preparing a landmark paper about European origins, now intended to visit their attention upon the South Pacific, and they wanted to know whether Bedford might facilitate access to the Teouma remains. Bedford agreed, and over the next four years, the Harvard team used the DNA they found to present a radical new story about Remote Oceania\u2019s first settlers.\\r\\nBedford and I met last summer in the hilly and sedate capital of Port-Vila, outside the towering thatched A-frame of the national museum. He is tall and friendly, with a square head, short brown hair, a rancher\u2019s open gait and the incessant squint of someone in perpetual communion with the near-hopeless complication of human affairs. We climbed into his white Land Cruiser and drove to a tidy village compound outside town. There, Bedford embraced the local chief, Silas Alben, who led us through village gardens of banana and tuber to a high limestone cliff with a sprawling view of the Teouma site.\\r\\nAs we shared the sweating neon flesh of a machete-split papaya, Bedford, now affiliated with the Australian National University, ran through all the reasons that the sheltered cove far below \u2014 just then rippling beneath a late-afternoon rainbow \u2014 would have made an inviting stage for the encounter of an ancient people with a primeval place. For whoever arrived in those first canoes, these empty islands offered a bounty of unfished reefs, unoccupied land and na\u00efve, slow-moving animal prey; for those who now studied those first colonists, their arrival represented an important inflection point in human expansion and development. And now, the science of \u201cpaleogenomics\u201d had coaxed new stories of ancient lives from the Teouma bones.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Prehistory: A History\\r\\nFor most of human history, our beliefs about our origins drew upon oral traditions or the evidence found in ancient texts. One 17th-century scholar calculated, on the basis of biblical genealogies, that the creation happened in 4004 B.C.; subsequent refinements settled on the date of Oct. 23. Sir Isaac Newton criticized the ancient Egyptians for the \u201cvanity\u201d of their own calendrical reckoning, which placed the beginning of their monarchy before the existence of the world. As the pre-eminent British archaeologist Colin Renfrew once put it, \u201cFor an educated man in the 17th or even the 18th century, any suggestion that the human past extended back further than 6,000 years was a vain and foolish speculation.\u201d\\r\\nIt wasn\u2019t long before a series of scientific interventions pried open human prehistory to methodical study. Two great advances of 1859 helped cement the view that 4004 B.C. was not, in fact, the starting point of all human activity. The first was the argument, made by a geologist and an antiquarian, that animal remains found alongside stone tools in Britain and France proved the antiquity of the human race. The second was the publication of Darwin\u2019s \u201cOn the Origin of Species,\u201d which was incompatible with both the specifics of biblical creationism and the more general proposition that the world was only a few thousand years old. It was all of a sudden widely plausible that stuff in the ground had been there for an unimaginably long time.\\r\\nBefore anyone could even begin to tell an ordered story about what might have happened, however, there needed to be a way to differentiate what happened sooner from what happened later. In the early 20th century, geologists and archaeologists began to draw upon contemporary observations of regular sedimentary deposits to project elementary prehistorical \u201cclocks\u201d backward in time. The end of the last ice age, for example, was set at about 10,000 years ago. Archaeologists then realized that they could cross-reference these geological clocks with the earliest written documents, ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian records that reached back 4,000 or 5,000 years. If geological time could be roughly calibrated everywhere, and if even a smattering of places had left behind calendars, recorded history could be tied to sedimentary chronology and true dates derived from the ground.\\r\\nThis was heralded as a magnificent advance. The trouble, as it turned out, was that an emphasis on written records from Egypt and the Middle East prompted scholars to take for granted the cultural superiority of those early civilizations and to make major assumptions on that basis \u2014 Stonehenge, for example, simply had to have followed the majesty of the Great Pyramids.\\r\\nIn 1949, the invention of radiocarbon dating, by the American physical chemist Willard F. Libby, turned the whole field upside down. By giving cosmically certain dates rather than cross-referenced estimations, radiocarbon dating undermined virtually all of archaeology\u2019s basic premises. (Stonehenge could not have been patterned after the Great Pyramids if it was built at the same time as Giza.) There was stubborn resistance to the new lab results. These dates, pronounced one vaunted Edinburgh archaeologist with a now-notorious sniff, are \u201carchaeologically unacceptable.\u201d By the early 1960s, they could no longer be ignored, and a new generation of archaeologists gutted the discipline and rebuilt it with very different assumptions \u2014 ones that did not rely on the idea that a few peoples of first-rate culture and pedigree had been responsible for humanity\u2019s major steps forward.\\r\\nIf prehistorians had learned one hard lesson from chemists, their colleagues in biology departments were slowly laying the groundwork for another. In 1967, the molecular biologist Allan Wilson at the University of California, Berkeley, along with one of his students, Vincent Sarich, demonstrated that evolutionary relationships between species could be determined not only from fossils but also, via a quantitative analysis of blood proteins, from living specimens. Humans and apes, Wilson found, diverged only five million years ago \u2014 far more recently than previously believed.\\r\\nWithin the decade, researchers trained in the discipline of population genetics would get in on the historical act. Every contemporary genome is a mosaic of individual tiles passed along from thousands of ancestors; each of us thus contains not only our \u201cown\u201d ancestry but those of multitudes. With each new generation, random mutations, like misspellings, are introduced into a population; some of these will disappear over time, but others will increase in frequency until they are common enough to become a statistically significant part of a population\u2019s genetic signature. If two populations have been distinct for a long time \u2014 that is, if people from one don\u2019t tend to mate with people from the other \u2014 they will share fewer of these mutations; if they encountered each other and were fruitful, their mutation frequencies will overlap. These insights could be made relevant to prehistorians insofar as they could demonstrate that modern human populations were forged in the mixture of ancient ones. It was still mostly impossible, though, to conclude anything about when these groups might have mixed, or where, or how.\\r\\nThe answers to those questions required not just contemporary genetic data but actual prehistoric DNA. The idea that it might be preserved in old specimens has been around since 1984, when Wilson announced that his lab had extracted DNA from the salted skin of a quagga, an extinct equine species with the head of a zebra and the haunches of a donkey. The further possibilities suggested by ancient DNA were awarded a special place in the public imagination by the 1993 release of Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cJurassic Park.\u201d But even as the journal Nature capitalized on the premiere with a paper that sequenced the DNA of an amber-trapped weevil \u2014 a study rendered dubious after widespread speculation that the sample had been contaminated with the researchers\u2019 own DNA \u2014 observers wondered whether the sequencing of ancient genomes was just a neat trick or research of actual value.\\r\\nOver the past few years, a growing cohort of scientists has at last produced a fantastic answer. Ancient DNA, they believe, not only allows us to cut through what scholars once wrote off as \u201cwrapped in a thick fog\u201d of \u201cheathendom.\u201d It promises nothing less than what the Harvard geneticist David Reich has called \u201cthe genome revolution in the study of the human past.\u201d\\r\\n3. The Revisionist\\r\\nDavid Reich\u2019s lab is folded into a corner of a glassy, long-corridored labyrinth at Harvard Medical School. The only exterior advertisements of the nature of his research are large mounted maps of landforms all around the world. One afternoon last fall, as I stood and examined a continent, Reich materialized beside me. He is a long-limbed man with a lithe, almost balletic figure, and he wore a closefitting pullover and fading coral chinos. Though his hairline has receded and the curls behind his ears are graying, a boyish precocity makes him seem much younger than his 44 years. He led me swiftly past a confab of postdocs and into his windowed office. There was very little in the way of adornment, save a ghostly, truncated branch of the Indo-European language tree (\u201cGreek,\u201d \u201cArmenian\u201d) that someone had sketched out, on the wall over his desk, with what looked a permanent marker.\\r\\nIn his recent book, Reich ranks the \u201cancient-DNA revolution\u201d with the invention of the microscope. Ancient DNA, his research suggests, can explain with more certainty and detail than any previous technique the course of human evolution, history and identity \u2014 as he puts it in the book\u2019s title, \u201cWho We Are and How We Got Here.\u201d Though Reich works with samples that are thousands or tens of thousands of years old, the phrase \u201cancient DNA\u201d encompasses any old genetic material that has been heavily degraded, and Reich\u2019s work has been made possible only by a series of technological and procedural advances. Researchers in the field ship or hand-carry the bones to Harvard, where clean-suited technicians expose them to ultraviolet light to prevent contamination, then bore holes in them with dental drills. These skeletal remains are often rare \u2014 one pinkie-finger fragment that researchers in a lab in Leipzig used to demonstrate the existence of a long-extinct form of archaic humans was one of only four such bones ever found. Minuscule portions of genetic code are isolated and enriched, then read by expensive sequencers; statistical techniques then plot the relationship between this particular sample and thousands more in enormous data sets.\\r\\nReich inherited from his parents a humanistic bent: His mother, Tova, is a novelist of some renown; his father, Walter, is a psychiatrist who was the first director of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. He entered Harvard with an inclination toward social studies, but halfway through, in pursuit of greater rigor, he switched to physics; after graduation, he went to Oxford, where he studied biochemistry with the idea that he might go on to medical school. The impression he gives when talking about these years is one of restless intellectual ambition in search of a commensurate object. He eventually returned to Oxford to complete a doctorate, in zoology, where he at last found a sense of belonging in the lineage of Luca Cavalli-Sforza, a population geneticist who spearheaded efforts to make historical inquiry resemble a hard science.\\r\\nAfter abandoning medical school at Harvard for a postdoc at M.I.T., Reich returned to Harvard to establish his own medical-genetics lab. His chief interest lay in the effort to design novel statistical approaches to better explain how populations were related to one another. He showed, for example, on the basis of contemporary genetic data, that modern Indians are in fact a product of two highly distinct groups, one that had been on the subcontinent for thousands of years and another that formed more recently.\\r\\nHe got his first opportunity to study ancient DNA when Svante Paabo \u2014 a Swedish geneticist who had worked with Wilson \u2014 enlisted Reich in his efforts, based out of a lab in Leipzig, to sequence the entirety of the Neanderthal genome. Reich\u2019s analysis helped demonstrate that most living humans, with the general exception of sub-Saharan Africans, have some Neanderthal ancestry. \u201cIt was clear with the sequencing of the Neanderthal,\u201d Reich told me in his office, \u201cthat this was obviously the best data in the world in any type of science.\u201d It didn\u2019t just tell you that Indians were a mixed group; it could, in theory, specify the moment where and when that mixture began.\\r\\nSo in 2013, Reich, along with a veteran of Paabo\u2019s lab and a longtime mathematician collaborator, retooled his shop at Harvard Medical School as one of the country\u2019s first dedicated ancient-DNA labs. The idea, he writes in his book, \u201cwas to make ancient DNA industrial \u2014 to build an American-style genomics factory\u201d that would liberate such fields as archaeology, history and anthropology from hitherto insoluble debates.\\r\\nHe was more successful than even he anticipated. By the end of 2010, only five ancient genomes had been sequenced in total, but in 2014, 38 were done in one year. Soon the number will be close to 2,000. Reich\u2019s lab alone is responsible for at least half of the published output, which doesn\u2019t include some 5,500 more bones in the process of being analyzed and 3,000 more in storage. \u201cAncient DNA and the genome revolution,\u201d he declares in his book\u2019s introductory overture, \u201ccan now answer a previously unresolvable question about the deep past: the question of what happened.\u201d\\r\\n4. What Happened?\\r\\nEverybody pretty much agrees that the story of what happened began in Africa, with the evolution of modern humans; later, as of 50,000 to 100,000 years ago, the human story continued on the other continents. As Reich sees it, the study of ancient DNA has disproved our conjectures about what happened next. One longtime premise is that as these early humans spread out in all directions over the land, groups of them encountered places that struck their fancy, pitched their tents and more or less stayed \u201chome\u201d for the duration of prehistory. This is not just a pet theory of academic prehistorians but the natural way that human beings have tended, over the millenniums, to connect their identities to where they live. The ni-Vanuatu, for example, take for granted their eternal ties to the archipelago; their oral traditions ascribe their origins to some nonhuman feature of the landscape, their first ancestors having emerged from a stone, say, or a coconut tree. Nonindigenous people seek the same rootedness in consumer ancestry services like 23andMe, which declare that they\u2019re \u201cSpanish\u201d or \u201cYoruba.\u201d\\r\\nReich believes he has proved, to the contrary, that human history is marked not by stasis and purity but by movement and cross-pollination. People who live in a place today often bear no genetic resemblance to people who lived there thousands of years ago, so the idea that something in your blood makes you meaningfully Spanish is absurd. Paabo had shown that early humans mated with Neanderthals, but that was only one small part of the swirling \u201cadmixture\u201d that characterized human interbreeding. Even after the Neanderthals became extinct, roughly 40,000 years ago, the archaic human populations of the earth \u2014 Reich gives them names like Ancient North Eurasians \u2014 were utterly unlike the populations we see today.\\r\\nWhile Paabo continued to work on the Neanderthal period, Reich devoted his energy to obtaining samples from the last 10,000 or so years \u2014 the historical domain of archaeologists. Ancient DNA\u2019s \u201cbig bang,\u201d as more than one geneticist described it to me, came with the 2015 publication, in Nature, of a Reich paper called \u201cMassive Migration From the Steppe Was a Source for Indo-European Languages in Europe.\u201d On the basis of genetic information culled from 69 ancient individuals dug up by collaborating archaeologists in Scandinavia, Western Europe and Russia, the paper argued that Europeans aren\u2019t quite who they thought they were. About 5,000 years ago, a \u201crelatively sudden\u201d mass migration of nomadic herders from the east \u2014 the steppes of eastern Ukraine and southern Russia \u2014 swept in and almost entirely replaced the continent\u2019s existing communities of hunter-gatherers and early farmers. These newcomers were known to exploit many of the cutting-edge technologies of the time: the domestication of horses, the wheel and, perhaps most salient, axes and spearheads of copper. (Their corpses sometimes featured cutting-edge wounds.)\\r\\nThe Reich team inferred that the major source of contemporary European ancestry \u2014 and probably Indo-European languages as well \u2014 was not, in fact, from Europe but from far to the east. And this discovery, confirmed by the near-simultaneous publication of almost identical results from a competing ancient-DNA lab in Denmark, had monumental implications for science\u2019s understanding of the whole ancient world. Great migration events \u2014 like the movement of Siberian peoples into North America or the spread of voyagers into the Pacific \u2014 were not outliers but the norm. After Europe and India, there were similar mass migrations identified in Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. No one ever expected that we could possibly amass so much new evidence about the human past. And no one was producing this work at the pace and throughput of David Reich and his genomics factory. Most scientists felt lucky if they published one or at the most two Nature papers in a lifetime. Reich was publishing three or four a year.\\r\\nThere was an obvious pattern to the great migratory arrows freshly drawn across world geography, which were often coincident with the spread of technology or agricultural practices. Earlier paleogenomic results established thousands of years of heady mixture among long-forgotten ancient populations. With the relatively recent rise of everything we associate with \u201cculture\u201d \u2014 technologies like agriculture, metallurgy and eventually writing \u2014 much of this continuous \u201cadmixture\u201d began to give way, it seemed, to discontinuous episodes better characterized as \u201creplacement\u201d or \u201cturnover.\u201d That is, about 5,000 to 9,000 years ago, human history was, at least in a few crucial places, less about various groups coming together and more about some groups blotting out their neighbors.\\r\\nThis was not only relevant as an eccentricity of prehistoric demography, but broadly consequential for the ongoing study of culture itself \u2014 of where new ideas come from and how they proliferate. When we thought of populations as stationary and largely stable, we assumed that whatever evolutionary progress they made, from toolmaking to agriculture, reflected either a native innovation or the incorporation of some adjacent group\u2019s avant-garde practice. Now it seemed as though culture was less about the invention and spread of new ideas and more about the mass movements of particular peoples \u2014 and the resulting integration, outcompetition or extermination of the communities they overran. Previously, it was possible to think about prehistory as a kind of grand bazaar. Now the operative metaphor (as multiple science journalists observed) was more like Risk, or even \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d\\r\\n5. Looking for the Lapita\\r\\nThe ancient-DNA revolution seemed unlikely to have anything to say about Oceania, where the heat and humidity made the preservation of DNA implausible. But in 2014, Stuart Bedford got that second surprise call, from a Dublin-based archaeologist named Ron Pinhasi, a frequent Reich collaborator and procurer of samples. Pinhasi had discovered that the inner ear\u2019s petrous bone, one of the densest in the body, often preserved vast quantities of genetic material. Could he and Reich examine the skulls of Teouma? In Vanuatu, human remains are often associated with ancestral spirits and are thus taboo \u2014 understandably, Bedford emphasized to me, explaining that he wouldn\u2019t be comfortable digging up and boring into \u201cGranddad.\u201d But in this case, the ni-Vanuatu expressed no reservations: Local oral traditions contained no sacred reference to the Teouma dead, and Chief Alben gave his blessing. One of Bedford\u2019s colleagues opened the skulls in a workshop warren behind the national museum, extracted the nubbins of petrous bone and shipped them to Dublin, where they were sandblasted. There turned out to be DNA in three of the samples. It was the first to be found in the tropics and suggested the opening of wide new fronts in ancient-DNA research.\\r\\nThe skulls of Teouma were particularly interesting to paleogenomicists not only because they produced the first ancient DNA in the Pacific but because their genetic evidence could be brought to bear on an outstanding debate in the region. The pivotal moment in Pacific archaeological history happened in 1952, when a team of researchers found a cache of dentate-stamped pots at a place called Lapita in New Caledonia, a French collectivity to the southwest of Vanuatu. More than 200 sites eventually turned up nearly duplicate versions of this innovation across an enormous span of the region. The pots were often found with particular varieties of preserved plants and nuts, as well as stone adzes. Whoever made those pots some 3,000 years ago had traveled across more than 2,000 miles of ocean \u2014 from near Papua New Guinea to Tonga and Samoa \u2014 in perhaps as little as 10 generations. As Patrick V. Kirch, the dean of American archaeology in the Pacific, once put it, \u201cWithout a doubt, the Lapita colonization of Remote Oceania ranks as one of the great sagas of world prehistory.\u201d\\r\\nWhere had this \u201cLapita\u201d culture come from, and who were the people associated with it? Over the last 50 years, a collaboration among archaeologists, linguists, botanists, ecologists, geologists and more had produced some form of consensus. A population of early farmers departed from Taiwan about 5,000 years ago, with the help of the newly developed outrigger canoe. They moved down through the Philippines and the Spice Islands, along the northern coasts of New Guinea and eventually out to the Bismarck Archipelago, more or less the limit of Near Oceania; the \u201ctracer dye\u201d for their path was the language family they left behind, one known as Austronesian. Along the way, they encountered populations of \u201cPapuans\u201d \u2014 a generic shorthand for highly distinct groups of people who had been in the Papua New Guinea region for 40,000 years. The interactions between the incoming \u201cAustronesians,\u201d another shorthand for whoever was presumably spreading those languages, and the indigenous Papuans created the constellation of practices that would become known as Lapita. Finally, the people now associated with Lapita sailed into the blankness of the open ocean for the first time, crossing the Remote Oceania divide to Vanuatu and, from there, outward to the farthest reaches of the Pacific.\\r\\nArchaeologists differed, often bitterly, on the details, but as Reich describes it in his book, the prevailing opinion was that \u201cthe Lapita archaeological culture was forged during a period of intense exchange between people ultimately originating in the farming center of China (via Taiwan) and New Guineans.\u201d This certainly made intuitive sense. The people of contemporary Vanuatu are black, like the Papuan people of New Guinea, but they speak Austronesian languages that can ultimately be traced to Asia. Reich believed that the existing consensus was the perfect sort of hypothesis to put to the ancient-DNA test. The Austronesians and the Papuans had been separated by at least 40,000 years of genetic differentiation, which meant that it would be very easy to discriminate by genetic signature. Would the samples taken from the skulls at Teouma show a closer relationship to the people of nearby Papua or the people of distant Asia?\\r\\nIn October 2016, the paper \u2014 with such well-regarded Pacific archaeologists as Stuart Bedford and his mentor, Matthew Spriggs of the Australian National University, among the 31 authors \u2014 was published in Nature as \u201cGenomic Insights Into the Peopling of the Southwest Pacific.\u201d The analysis of ancient DNA from three 3,000-year-old skulls from Teouma, along with one skull dated a few hundred years later from Tonga, appeared to provide unambiguous confirmation of Lapita heritage. The First Remote Oceanians, as the paper calls them, were not, after all, a heterogenous group; they were of unmixed Asian descent.\\r\\nThe paper suggested that the old archaeological consensus \u2014 that the Lapita advances reflected the joint contributions of Austronesian and Papuan peoples \u2014 could be replaced by a much starker story. The genetic record can be more \u201cparsimoniously explained,\u201d the authors remark, by at least two separate migrations to Vanuatu: first, the Austronesians, with their East Asian ancestry, and then, hundreds of years later, the Papuans. This wasn\u2019t a story of \u201cadmixture\u201d but one of successive waves of migratory \u201cturnover.\u201d\\r\\nThese results were published two years earlier, but as we sat in his silent office, Reich still betrayed some enduring wonder at his revelation. He reminded me that he hadn\u2019t been trained as an archaeologist and had thus come to these debates as an outsider. In the broadest conceptual terms, though, he saw the lessons of this once-enigmatic Lapita migration to be exceedingly profound. \u201cI think the important finding for archaeologists and for historians and sociologists and anthropologists is that this group moved thousands of kilometers over many hundreds of years, through a region occupied by long-established, sophisticated people, and hardly mixed with them.\u201d He observed that \u201cessentially everybody was surprised.\u201d They were surprised, in part, because archaeologists since the 1960s had been trained never to assume the purity or coherence of a people, a slippery slope to the conclusion that certain peoples came by their advantages \u201cnaturally.\u201d\\r\\nBut the data seemed indisputable. \u201cNow we can establish that definitively. That\u2019s what this technology allows us to do. And then they\u201d \u2014 meaning all those other disciplines, which heretofore had overseen the study of prehistory \u2014 \u201ccan get on with answering what really matters, which is try to interpret what happened.\u201d\\r\\nHe paused. \u201cBut I think that basically everybody, almost without exception \u2014 except for very extreme people \u2014 is excited about this data in archaeology.\u201d\\r\\nPART II\\r\\n6. The Storm Beneath the Surface\\r\\nThe primary characteristic of the deepest reaches of the past, especially for the sort of observer whose paramount concerns are those of the present, is the accommodating silence found there. The quieter an epoch on its own terms, the more loudly it can be made to speak, in the way of a ventriloquist\u2019s dummy, for ours. The study of ancient peoples \u2014 or of the \u201cprimitive\u201d ones often taken to stand in as their contemporary proxies \u2014 has been framed by our preference for simple, just-so stories of origin and trajectory. Archaeologists, who feel as though they learned this lesson long ago, thus survey the rapid rise of ancient DNA with an overwhelming sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. By once again giving \u201cmigration\u201d pride of place in the story of prehistory, paleogenomics has resurrected some old intellectual ghosts.\\r\\nBy the time radiocarbon dating had come of age, in the postcolonial ferment of the 1960s, archaeology was already primed to relinquish its emphasis on narratives of migration. In the 1910s, a German named Gustaf Kossinna turned his personal fixation on heightened Proto-Germanic Barbarian activity after the fall of Rome into a theory, \u201csettlement archaeology,\u201d that emphasized the glory of the German nation. For Kossinna, a given material culture \u2014 a uniformity in pottery style, say \u2014 was the index of a coherent people, and it was the destiny of the Germans, greater than even that of the Romans, to extend their superior Aryan culture from their homeland to the ends of the earth. The Nazis were more than happy to put these claims into service, and even academics with better politics became convinced that the driver of human progress was the roving exogenous shock of migratory adventures. As Colin Renfrew described it: \u201cPrehistory was seen as a kind of global chessboard, with the various cultures as pieces shifting from square to square. The task of the archaeologist was simply to plot the moves \u2014 or, in other words, trace the path of the \u2018influence\u2019 as new ideas were diffused.\u201d\\r\\nThe brutal ramifications of settlement archaeology, when combined with the dramatic introduction of radiocarbon dating, shook the entire discipline to its foundations. The disruption was so major that the profession felt it had to rehabilitate itself as the \u201cNew Archaeology.\u201d This new generation of practitioner agreed that just because similar pots were found in various places didn\u2019t mean they were all made by one homogeneous group of people. Instead, archaeologists retreated to a much more modest and fine-comb preoccupation with what they called the \u201cprocessual\u201d: very particular inquiries into very particular societal dynamics. They paid much closer attention to how individual cultures appeared to change and grow over time and much less attention to how Culture Had Changed \u2014 to the fantasy that some special key will unlock the secrets of history. This left a big-picture vacuum that paleogenomicists like Reich have been eager to fill.\\r\\nThe resulting schism has been easy to caricature as the old struggle between hard scientists and humanists \u2014 a suspicion of all geneticists as quantitative imperialists, a derision of all archaeologists as sentimental Luddites \u2014 but that isn\u2019t quite accurate. Many archaeologists are thrilled about the arrival of the first genuinely new form of prehistoric data in generations. The more meaningful division is between two alternate intellectual attitudes: those bewitched by grand historical narratives, who believe that there is something both detailed and definitive to say about the very largest questions, and those who wearily warn that such adventures rarely end well.\\r\\nArchaeologists shouldn\u2019t necessarily care. They remain theoretically free to continue doing things at processual pace, paying thorough attention to historic context and indigenous sensitivities. Even those who are enthusiastic about ancient-DNA research \u2014 not only for the new data it provides but for the vigor it has brought to their field \u2014 could in principle choose to partner only with geneticists who respect their priorities and expertise; after all, they are the ones who dig the samples out of the ground, and nobody is forcing them to surrender their treasures at gunpoint. Collaborations between geneticists and archaeologists on an even footing have produced well-received studies that plot, say, the family trees in a medieval cemetery.\\r\\nBut in practice, the paleogenomicists have totally altered the environment in which prehistory is being studied by everyone. The landscape is dominated by four well-funded, well-connected labs, three of which \u2014 Paabo\u2019s in Leipzig, along with those of two of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Reich at Harvard and Johannes Krause, who runs a newer outfit in the small German city Jena \u2014 collaborate closely with one another, to the point that some critics accuse them of collusion. The power of these top labs extends to samples, data and even technology: Proprietary chemical reagents let them isolate and enrich ancient samples much more accurately and cost-effectively than other labs can. One geneticist compared competing with the big labs to battling an entire navy \u201cwith a little dinghy, armed with a small knife.\u201d Another told me: \u201cA small lab focusing on a particular site would not be able to place their work in the context of the bigger picture. The only way I can get access to that data is if I give my bone to David or Johannes and wait until they process it \u2014 and bury me in the list of contributors to their paper.\u201d\\r\\nThe selective pressure to collaborate with this state-of-the-art oligopoly is extremely strong, not only because of their advantages in funding, speed and operational scale but also because of the relationships they enjoy with the top-tier journals. Publication in a title like Nature or Science can utterly transform a young scholar\u2019s career, enhancing both the prospect of tenure and the ability to secure grant funding. The rush to corner the market on old bones in some \u201cunderstudied\u201d place or time period has placed a high premium on virtually all samples, creating perverse incentives for researchers to procure these scarce, nonrenewable resources. The only entry fee for a 27th or 53rd author slot in this \u201cfree-for-all bonanza of Nature papers\u201d (as one geneticist described it to me) is the cost of a bone shipment and a minimal account of its basic archaeological provenance. Multiple researchers told me that it wasn\u2019t unusual for junior authors to be given just days to review a finished manuscript, with little input into its broader framing. (Reich, Krause and Paabo all dispute this, saying they couldn\u2019t think of any examples in which co-authors were given such a short time to review a manuscript.)\\r\\nThere thus reigns, in the world of ancient DNA, an atmosphere of intense suspicion, anxiety and paranoia, among archaeologists and geneticists alike. In dozens of interviews with practitioners of both disciplines, almost everyone requested anonymity for fear of professional reprisal. Many archaeologists described a \u201csmash and grab\u201d culture in which hopeful co-authors source their bones by any means necessary. Among teams at work on any given excavation, it takes only a single colleague to deliver a bone to one of the industrial giants for the entire group to lose control of their findings. Museums, too, are being swept up by the perverse incentives: One of the geneticists told me stories about having brokered an agreement to sample a particular collection, only to arrive and discover that someone else showed up the previous day to claim the same bones under a false pretense. The weaker the institutions of the country, the harder it is for local researchers to have a fighting chance. Scientists in Turkey and Mexico told me that museum curators routinely had to explain that they had promised their native bone collections elsewhere. As one ancient-DNA researcher in Turkey put it to me, \u201cCertain geneticists see the rest of world as the 19th-century colonialists saw Africa \u2014 as raw-material opportunities and nothing else.\u201d\\r\\n(Reich, Krause and Paabo strenuously denied the characterization of their labs as colluding in a manner that harms competitors. Krause noted that his lab employs students and scientists from 30 nations and supports foreign researchers. Reich commented via email: \u201cThe fact that the substantial majority of the world\u2019s human ancient DNA data has been produced by a small number of laboratories is not because of any special access to samples, but rather because of the high quality of work these laboratories deliver.\u201d)\\r\\nIt has not gone unnoticed that the stunning, magisterial sweep of genetic revisionism, on the one hand, and a genetic emphasis on radical prehistoric migrations, on the other, bear more than a little in common. Some anthropologists and archaeologists accept this analogy with gallows humor. One told me that I should model this article after the format of the standard Nature paper: \u201cAncient DNA Reveals Massive Population Turnovers in the Humanities,\u201d she suggested as a title, and proposed this as an abstract: \u201cThe aristocratic lab scientists arrived with their superior technology and displaced the pre-existing researchers and their primitive truth-implements and overcomplicated belief systems.\u201d\\r\\nOthers saw less to laugh at. Some archaeologists who had collaborated on the 2015 paper about Indo-European invasions withdrew their names to protest conclusions they saw as echoes of Kossinna \u2014 the mass migrations of advanced Indo-Europeans into Central Europe. (Reich got the critics back on board by adding a note, on Page 138 of their paper\u2019s 141-page supplementary materials, that said their work in fact contradicted Kossinna, not because he was wrong about mass migration but on a technicality: The European ancestral homeland had, in fact, been far to the east, near the Caucasus and nowhere near present-day Germany.) The analogue was hard to counter. Geneticists had indeed swept down from their laboratory enclaves to extend their sovereignty over what had always been the terrain of archaeology. And no single individual had as much influence or power as Reich.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. The Postage-Stamp Problem\\r\\nMigration in the Pacific had never been quite as fraught as it was elsewhere; the people had obviously shown up from someplace. Or rather, this had been obvious to outsiders, if not to the locals. Upon our return from the Teouma overlook, Bedford went off to catch up on village gossip, and I sat with Chief Alben in the shade of a stout, leggy banyan tree, its exposed root system rising from the earth like a half-exhumed skeleton. Alben is a hale and jovial older man with a round paunch and a push-broom mustache. For years, he has participated in a volunteer fieldworker program that trains the ni-Vanuatu to record and preserve their local traditions amid the creep of global monoculture and to pay attention to the sorts of archaeological finds they might otherwise ignore.\\r\\nI asked him about how the concept of Lapita migration to empty islands had been received by people whose oral traditions said they came from a stone or a coconut tree. After the Teouma find, the national post issued a special commemorative stamp \u2014 \u201cLapita People: The Pacific\u2019s Original Explorers\u201d \u2014 with an artist\u2019s recreation of a colonial Eden that showed men and women, drawn black to resemble the ni-Vanuatu, cleaning fish and making camp, and Bedford printed pamphlets for schoolchildren that explained that the Lapita were the grandfathers of grandfathers of grandfathers. Now Reich\u2019s research had raised the prospect that they bore not even a passing resemblance to Vanuatu\u2019s earliest settlers.\\r\\nIn the wake of the initial discoveries at Teouma, Alben replied, he explained to his villagers that there was nothing surprising in the fact that the grandfathers of grandfathers of grandfathers had once come from someplace else. \u201cOur kastom teaches us that people moved from place to place to place,\u201d he told me. Kastom is an expansive concept that includes tradition, history, land rights and social norms; local kastom varies tremendously across the more than 80 islands of Vanuatu, but the notion itself has become sacrosanct for the continuity and authority it provided in the aftermath of colonial occupation.\\r\\nAlben told me he had been stymied by the practicalities, though. \u201cMaybe these Lapita people came from Asia! How? How?! How can these people come here?\u201d\\r\\nHe waited for me to answer, but it wasn\u2019t clear what he meant; I shrugged and ventured a timid, \u201cCanoe?\u201d\\r\\nHe shook with laughter at such a painfully obvious answer. His question was not about what they used to cross the water but how they founded a way of life that endured until today. \u201cThey took the coconut\u201d \u2014 he pointed off to his left \u2014 \u201cand they took the breadfruit\u201d \u2014 he pointed off to his right \u2014 \u201cand they put it into the canoe. When the canoe lands, they plant.\u201d The people, in other words, were tied to the land by what they had brought with them. On the road out of Port-Vila, I\u2019d made an idle remark to Bedford about the primeval greenery around us; he corrected me to say that what looked like jungle was actually under heavy cultivation.\\r\\nThe ni-Vanuatu were not accustomed to thinking about history for its own sake, instead expecting that any story you told about the past necessarily gave form and guidance to the present. If kastom told you that your people came from a stone near the lagoon, that was relevant for ongoing disputes about who now deserved to till that land. The idea that in some abstract, scientific way they were \u201creally\u201d from somewhere else didn\u2019t mean anything unless there was a direct contemporary moral.\\r\\nThey did know, however, that what had often been presented to them as abstract scientific knowledge routinely concealed some practical agenda. The first European explorers in the region, even if they weren\u2019t quite so forthrightly instrumental about it, also interpreted the history of the South Seas to suit their own contemporary concerns \u2014 both imperial and philosophical. Pacific Islanders, marooned in what were seen as the natural laboratories of primal isolation, were enlisted as the \u201cnoble savages\u201d of Enlightenment fantasy. The question of who they were and where they had come from became lively topics. Some ventured that they were refugees from the Lost Continent of Mu. Others tried to classify them in a way that would accord with their own pet-scientific notions of cultural evolution. The French explorer Dumont d\u2019Urville, who first sighted Vanuatu in the 1820s, proposed a tripartite scheme that unfortunately endured: There were the Polynesians (\u201cmany islands\u201d), the lighter-skinned people who inhabited an enormous triangle of the Eastern Pacific bounded by Hawaii, New Zealand and Easter Island; the Micronesians (\u201csmall islands\u201d), who lived on the atolls of the Western Pacific north of the Equator; and, always finally, the Melanesians (\u201cdark islands\u201d), the dark-skinned people east of New Guinea who spanned the divide between Near and Remote Oceania. Europeans fixated on the differences between the Melanesians and the Polynesians, imagining the Polynesians as a kind of laggard aristocracy, comparable to the ancient Greeks, and the Melanesians as naturally backward black people.\\r\\nAnd so, when it came to the question of how ancient peoples had populated the Pacific, the most persistent proposals rested on racial typologies. The Melanesians obviously came from in and around Papua, which was relatively nearby and inhabited by \u201csavage\u201d black people, whereas the lighter-skinned and more \u201cadvanced\u201d Polynesians probably sojourned via heroic open-sea navigation from Asia. Anything \u201csuperior\u201d \u2014 technology or social structure \u2014 was linked to the migratory intervention of exceptional groups from distant shores. The European colonial enterprise was thus justified as part of the natural relationship of incoming enlightenment and indigenous savagery.\\r\\nThe ni-Vanuatu are not unaware of the region\u2019s racialized history, or of its racialized present. As Bedford and I drove back to town, the only visible graffiti was a reminder of regional Melanesian pride: \u201cFree West Papua,\u201d a show of racial solidarity with the black residents of the western half of New Guinea, a persecuted colonial possession of Indonesia since the early 1960s. A new sort of colonial anxiety, meanwhile, is manifesting itself about the Chinese, who have been investing heavily in the country. The old shops on Port-Vila\u2019s main harborside drag have been replaced by cheap Chinese joints hawking souvenir ukuleles, and the new luxury-condominium developments above downtown advertise \u201cHong Kong Apartment-Style Life\u201d over images of white and Asian people in infinity pools.\\r\\nBedford and his archaeologist colleagues on Vanuatu are known for their long tenure in the country and their keen acquaintance with local sensitivities, and it was only on their bond that the Teouma petrous bones were sent abroad for sandblasting. Now their names were on a genetics paper arguing that the ni-Vanuatu\u2019s ancestors were not Lapita after all, but latecomers to an archipelago first settled by purely Asian expeditions.\\r\\n8. The Ghosts of Peer Review\\r\\nAs it happens, this radical claim was not as definitively accepted as the published paper seemed to show: Serious challenges to its soundness were laid out during Nature\u2019s peer-review process. And yet, in a highly unusual move, the paper was accepted over the steadfast objections of two of the three peer reviewers on its anonymous panel. Confidential documents made available to me reveal deep concerns with the paper\u2019s methods and its conclusions.\\r\\nAmong the two objecting reviewers, the methodological critiques \u2014 both on the level of archaeological context and that of data analysis \u2014 were paramount. \u201cIt seems to me that a significant question,\u201d Reviewer Two writes, \u201cis whether these individuals were actually \u2018Lapita people,\u2019 assuming that such a thing exists.\u201d The paper listed six of the nine skulls found at Teouma, though the team had only successfully extracted ancient DNA from three of them. \u201cIn addition,\u201d Reviewer Two continues, \u201cit seems clear that these skulls were not related to the 100+ individuals excavated from the Teouma site. That is, the skulls do not fit the bodies. Clearly there was a complex set of traditions around these burials including decapitation at some time before or after initial burial. I am curious as to whether these skulls might have been kept by relatives and only later (perhaps much later) (re)buried at Teouma,\u201d a tradition among some indigenous groups.\\r\\nEven if the skulls were the same age as the rest of the bones at the cemetery, there was still the matter of how oddly they had been interred \u2014 one inside a jar, the others arrayed like a shield across another skeleton\u2019s chest. \u201cThis seems to suggest,\u201d Reviewer Two adds, \u201cthat the three people were special in some way. Hence I am concerned about drawing too many conclusions from such a small number of individuals plus individuals who were certainly not a random sample of the population.\u201d Shouldn\u2019t the collaborating archaeologists have pointed all this out?\\r\\nThe study\u2019s authors, the objecting reviewers insist, had made disproportionate or even wholly unwarranted claims on the basis of both the archaeological and genetic evidence they had provided. Yes, the Teouma skulls came from an important site, and yes, the new data they provided was a fascinating additional piece of evidence. But they still just represented three samples from one site on one island, and the objecting reviewers noted that Reich\u2019s inferences could have been skewed by what one of them called \u201cbias in the method\u201d \u2014 the set of assumptions necessitated by his complex statistical models. Meanwhile, the contemporary samples they used for historical comparison weren\u2019t even from Vanuatu, but from potentially unrelated regional communities used as proxies. \u201cIn my opinion,\u201d Reviewer Three wrote, \u201cthis paper does not merit a significant advancement over current studies and the lack of detail regarding basic data description is frustrating.\u201d\\r\\nThe paper\u2019s purchase on significance, then, seemed to have less to do with its originality than with its certainty. The title of the first submission was \u201cAncient DNA Documents Multiple Human Migrations Into the South Pacific,\u201d and it presumed to offer the final word on the history and ancestry of an entire region. Three contemporaneous samples might be sufficient for a modest paper about the Teouma site, but modest papers about one archaeological site in Vanuatu are not the sort of thing Nature is in the business of publishing. \u201cIn the light of these various comments,\u201d an editor wrote to the reviewers, \u201cwe have declined publication of this study.\u201d There is a clear distinction, at Nature and elsewhere, between a rejection and a call to revise and resubmit. \u201cRejection means rejection,\u201d one geneticist told me, \u201cand rejection is final.\u201d\\r\\nYet the Reich team proceeded to revise. They were aided in this by their colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, in Jena. Its director of archaeogenetics, Johannes Krause, had worked alongside Reich in Paabo\u2019s lab. When the Jena team heard that the Oceania paper had been found wanting for further regional samples \u2014 samples that would allow them to expand their claims beyond simply Vanuatu \u2014 one doctoral candidate remembered that their inventory contained a stray petrous bone from a site in Tonga, one already found to contain readable DNA. It was, fortuitously, highly relevant to Reich\u2019s Oceania work, and the data was forwarded along in due course.\\r\\nOn the basis of this single additional ancient bone, the Reich lab resubmitted their paper. The revision addressed very few of the other reviewer concerns, and the changes it did provide struck the objecting reviewers \u2014 who were asked, to their surprise, to review a revision \u2014 as perfunctory and weak. \u201cThe analysis and data generation presented herein, in my opinion,\u201d Reviewer Three ultimately concluded, \u201csimply does not merit a Nature-level manuscript.\u201d Nevertheless, the paper was accepted.\\r\\nWhen pressed about the peer-review process, Reich told me his reply to the initial round of concerns had been \u201cthe most robust, powerful, compelling response we\u2019ve ever given to a set of reviews. We completely answered absolutely every question very robustly; there was not a single point in those Reviewer Two and Three comments that had any validity and that we were not able to fully and powerfully answer.\u201d When I noted that the objecting reviewers had not been convinced by their counterarguments, he said: \u201cThe fact that a person who sends a review doesn\u2019t feel like their arguments have been answered doesn\u2019t mean that they haven\u2019t been answered. I felt that those reviews were not compelling reviews, didn\u2019t make sense, didn\u2019t take into account the actual evidence that we had brought to bear properly and were completely addressed by our response, and the journal agreed.\u201d\\r\\nHe acknowledged that it was rare for journal editors to overrule their referees. \u201cThis was a case where the reviewers were making egregious errors,\u201d Reich said. \u201cThese were problematic reviews that should have been discounted because of their problematic nature, and we were able to successfully make that case on very good grounds, and the editor agreed with that in the course of the review process. And it\u2019s a very rare thing.\u201d (A spokesperson for Nature said in a statement, \u201cFor confidentiality reasons, we cannot discuss the editorial history or review process of any Nature paper with anyone other than the authors.\u201d)\\r\\nAt the end of our conversation, Reich returned to his Vanuatu effort, waxing unsolicitedly about his personal attachment to the finding. \u201cThat paper is such an important paper. It\u2019s such an important observation, such an important measurement \u2014 it\u2019s exactly the type of thing that needs to be published in that type of journal. It\u2019s in the class of an unrejectable paper.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n9. The Seductions of \u2018Migration\u2019\\r\\nIn Reich\u2019s view, quibbles about which skull did or did not fit which skeleton in an ancient tropical cemetery in a land he had never visited were entirely beside the point. He was doing large-scale, broad-brush work, and it was up to the archaeologists to add their fine filigree of detail. Even if you accepted the paper\u2019s broad-brush results, however, most archaeologists find this distinction misleading. The problem wasn\u2019t that he was explaining too much on the basis of too little, but that he wasn\u2019t ultimately explaining anything at all; it was all well and good to put \u201cmigration\u201d back on the table, but the concept itself did little to clarify what was actually going on. For example, it was a still a mystery that secondary Papuan migrants had replaced the original settlers but somehow adopted their Austronesian language.\\r\\nThe Jena outfit, evenly split between geneticists, archaeologists and linguists, was set up to address questions of this order, in studies designed to include each discipline\u2019s contributors as full partners. The edifice itself is an architectural bricolage, a vaguely Bauhaus-inspired white building conjoined via metal tube to a stately 19th-century villa. The head of the institute\u2019s department of linguistic and cultural evolution had decided that his team\u2019s flagship project would be a fine-grained 10-year investigation of the \u201cGal\u00e1pagos of language evolution\u201d that made Vanuatu a \u201cmicrocosm of all those forces that have generated human diversity.\u201d\\r\\nA young Irish anthropologist, Heidi Colleran, was brought on to help lead the relevant ethnographic field research; just before she left, she and her partner, a British population geneticist named Adam Powell (who also happened to be her collaborator on the project), were asked if they might try to collect spit from the groups she planned to work with, for the purposes of a proper contemporary baseline. Reich had used other modern Oceanic groups as rough proxies in part because no one imagined that any ni-Vanuatu would ever assent to such a study. Stuart Bedford, who had been brought in on the Jena project, believed that it wouldn\u2019t happen in a million years. If outsiders said that spit held secrets about the past, the ni-Vanuatu might worry that those secrets \u2014 if these foreigners said they were \u201cactually\u201d from elsewhere, indeed latecomers to their own nation \u2014 could nullify their rights to the land. After the publication of Reich\u2019s paper, the indigenous Kanaks of \u201cneighboring\u201d New Caledonia declared a three-year moratorium on any genetic research, for fear that their limited sovereignty might be undermined.\\r\\nThe Jena team sought the ethical oversight of an institutional review board. Once in Vanuatu, Colleran, along with Powell and Kaitip Kami, the curator at the national museum, pitched their project as a way for villagers to understand where they fit in the family tree of the Pacific; they also promised that, in accordance with best ethical practices, they would return to present the results to the participant communities. To their great delight, they were deluged with willing volunteers. Over the next year, the researchers back in Jena put these results together with data they had retrieved from 19 new ancient samples; after a review period of six weeks, their paper appeared in Nature Ecology & Evolution on Feb. 27, 2018.\\r\\nWhile so much of Reich\u2019s work has conjured the notion of sweeping, wholesale replacements by one population of another, the Jena paper proposed instead a much more gradual process. Their samples demonstrated not a single decisive turnover event but at least 500 years of ongoing traffic between Papuans and Austronesians \u2014 plenty of time to explain how the former had managed to pick up the latter\u2019s languages, for one thing. Whatever happened in that period was clearly complex, but it seemed to them inaccurate to describe it as the one-off snuffing out of one group by another. \u201cThe idea that one day there were tons of people in canoes,\u201d Krause told me when I met him in Jena, \u201cthat\u2019s not how we should see it.\u201d What Reich was wont to attribute to simple \u201cmigration\u201d was just a restatement of the problem of what happened. The actual causal mechanism could have been malaria, or warfare, or volcanic activity, or some competitive advantage in agriculture.\\r\\nA thought experiment might help to illustrate this. Imagine that the written history of our current era were lost to time, and paleogenomicists of the future were trying to explain the peopling of North America on the basis of a few bones that dated from between the 16th and 20th centuries. If these bones included the descendants of British, Spanish and French colonists as well as those of Yoruba slaves, the researchers might conclude that European migrants arrived together with African migrants and that their \u201csex-biased admixture\u201d created the people known henceforth as Americans. From our perspective, those geneticists wouldn\u2019t exactly be wrong about all this \u2014 but nobody would accuse them of being right, either.\\r\\nThere\u2019s no particularly good reason to believe that the past was significantly simpler than the present, and archaeologists have come to believe that the more digging they do, the more complexity they uncover. It makes sense that they would resist simple explanations. From Reich\u2019s perspective, this archaeological truculence represents a stubborn attachment to the old, complicated stories in the face of new molecular data \u2014 just as some archaeologists held fast to their tall tales despite what Renfrew called the \u201cmysterious boffinry\u201d of radiocarbon dating. The analogy, however, doesn\u2019t quite work. This time the scientists have arrived with their advanced technologies not to dismantle theories of coherent \u201ccultures\u201d who \u201cmigrated\u201d from \u201chomelands\u201d but to revive them \u2014 without any disciplinary memory of the traps involved or the stakes of failure.\\r\\nOver the course of 2017, Reich was working on his own competing follow-up, though by the time the Jena team submitted its completed paper to journals he had barely begun to compose his own. (Reich, who told me he could not remember the specific timeline, said, \u201cThe whole analysis was mature; we basically had the key findings already \u2014 we were just slow in writing it up, because we were overextended.\u201d) The two labs had briefly contemplated collaborating, but in May 2017, the Jena team vetoed the idea, one of its leaders told me, because Reich wanted too much control. So the projects advanced separately. Reich tried unsuccessfully to get contemporary ni-Vanuatu spit from other researchers until he learned of some blood samples, drawn decades ago by medical researchers and now held in trust at a repository at Oxford. The Reich team obtained permission to resequence the old samples for their own purposes \u2014 even though in gray-area cases like these it is never at all clear who holds the authority to retroactively license the use of vital fluids taken when ethical protocols were considerably more lax. He also had 11 new \u201cancient\u201d samples, though six of them were from only about 150 years ago.\\r\\nReich submitted his manuscript to the journal Current Biology on the same day that Jena\u2019s paper was accepted by Nature Ecology & Evolution. One week later, on Feb. 19, the paper was accepted and given an online publication date of Feb. 28 \u2014 one day after the online publication date the Jena team had been given. Peer review and acceptance of a paper in a week was in itself an unprecedented feat; not a single person I talked to in the field could think of a similar case. Reich conceded that it was uncommon. \u201cIt was the fastest review we ever had,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut it was actually a very high-quality review. It was better than most reviews we got. It was actually a serious review, a very serious review.\u201d Some other geneticists doubted it; one said to me: \u201cThere\u2019s no way there\u2019s proper peer review there. That\u2019s an egregious violation of scientific norms.\u201d (\u201cThe Reich paper was properly reviewed by three relevant experts, all of whom recommended publication with minor requests for revision,\u201d the Current Biology editor in chief, Geoffrey North, said in an emailed statement, crediting the turnaround to reviewers who made the paper a priority.) Even so, publication on successive days was apparently not a satisfactory outcome. On Feb. 19, Reich\u2019s paper appeared in preprint form on the web, eight days before the Jena effort came out.\\r\\nWhile the Jena samples showed at least 500 years of Austronesian-Papuan mixture, Reich\u2019s follow-up argued \u2014 on the basis of a single sample from a single island \u2014 that the First Remote Oceanians had been replaced by at least one wave of belated Papuans. Otherwise, the paper had little to add. Reich had, however, updated his analysis of the original skulls with improved, \u201chigher-resolution\u201d statistical techniques. One new data point, which Reich saw as a refinement, struck some critics as a significant revision: While Reich emphasized to me in his office that the first paper conclusively demonstrated no mixture between the Austronesians and the people they encountered, the updated analysis showed that Teouma\u2019s \u201cLapita individuals had a nonzero proportion of Papuan-related ancestry.\u201d It \u201cremains striking,\u201d the new paper remarked, that these first migrants were only \u201cminimally admixed\u201d \u2014 but admixed they were.\\r\\n10. The Archaeologist\u2019s Dilemma\\r\\nDay\u2019s end in Port-Vila is colored by the process of selecting which kava bar to patronize; each imports its kava from a different island, and friendly arguments about kava strength and quality are common. On our return from Teouma, Bedford and I met up with an extended crew from the national museum for kava grown on the volcanic slopes of the northern island of Ambae, where an eruption threatened to stop shipments. Kava is a cloudy green tonic, served in little miso bowls meant to resemble coconut shells. The custom is to collect your shell, retire alone to the cover of a nearby shadow, take the entirety at one draft and then spit the particulate remnants; by nightfall, when even the city is blanketed in thick dark, the only regular sounds are the screech of the fruit bat and the hock of spit.\\r\\nI sat in the dark next to Frederique Valentin, a French bioarchaeologist who was an author on Reich\u2019s original Vanuatu paper; it was she who made the final contribution that rescued the effort, the Tongan petrous bone. As it turns out, in 2015 she submitted a manuscript to Nature that made an almost identical argument to Reich\u2019s. She had reached the same conclusions upon examination of the cranial morphology of the exact same skulls, which she believed more closely resembled those of Asians than those of Papuans. But her paper was rejected by Nature. As far as she or many others could tell, the only difference between her conclusions and Reich\u2019s were those of methods \u2014 hers old, theirs shiny and new \u2014 and rhetorical grandeur. I asked if she thought that Reich\u2019s definitive statements about Lapita origins were warranted.\\r\\n\u201cA small sample,\u201d she replied, \u201cis only representative of itself.\u201d\\r\\nThe controversy over paleogenomics was becoming a near-ubiquitous presence in archaeology journals, and Bedford, as an author on all three Vanuatu papers, had recently written the introduction to an academic forum on the subject, in the journal Archaeology in Oceania. The evident differences between the two competing follow-ups put him in a bit of a bind, because his name was on both of them. \u201cBoth papers,\u201d Bedford maintained, \u201carrive at a similar conclusion,\u201d that initial Austronesian settlement was followed by a Papuan gene flow. But as the introduction continued, it became increasingly clear that he could not, in fact, at all believe that both could be right, and he tipped his hand in favor of the Jena paper, with its emphasis on an \u201cincremental and complex\u201d process that accorded much better with the artifactual record as he had spent his career understanding it.\\r\\nThe contradictions of Bedford\u2019s introduction \u2014 in which he said that both papers could be right but that the complicated one was probably more right than the simplistic one \u2014 felt less like an equivocation than it did a form of subtle apology. As one contributor to Bedford\u2019s forum observed, archaeologists had told the ni-Vanuatu for decades that they were the descendants of the Lapita voyagers; now they had to go back and advise them to alter the commemorative postage stamps to feature not black people but Taiwanese aboriginals. A national self-image was not something to take lightly. \u201cOne can only feel,\u201d one forum contributor wrote, \u201ca collective sense of betrayal in all of this.\u201d\\r\\nSome critics believed that any association with Reich represented a betrayal, too, not only of the ni-Vanuatu but of anyone who believed that culture was as powerful a human determinant as the gene. Shortly before the publication of his book, Reich wrote an Op-Ed in The New York Times in which he warned that the future was likely to demonstrate some meaningful genetic differences among populations and that we needed to be honest about such truths, lest they be abused by racist pseudoscience. He was careful to differentiate the idea of a genetic population from the old idea of race, which he agreed was a social rather than biological fact. But he nonetheless gave comfort to those who maintain that on the deepest of all levels our destiny is written into our genetic signature. It was hard not to see that conviction reflected in the findings of Reich\u2019s papers, which seemed to blithely recapitulate discredited theories of Pacific expansion, making categorical claims not only about four individual skulls but about the shape of human history \u2014 claims that were essentially indistinguishable from the racialized notions of the swashbuckling imperial era.\\r\\nYounger scholars who don\u2019t think that the big, powerful labs are exhibiting proper respect, sensitivity and historical consciousness \u2014 including anthropologists like Heidi Colleran, who went to great lengths for ni-Vanuatu spit \u2014 are thus put into impossible positions of tragic compromise; they face the decision to spend their careers as access mercenaries, to work with smaller outfits that get pushed aside or scooped, or to get out of the field entirely. As Colleran would put it to me later: \u201cWhen any fieldworker talks to collaborating communities in the field, they are putting their professional and personal integrity on the line, their own legitimacy, often in a completely different line of work, for these samples. And once they are out of your hands, you have very little control. That\u2019s a gamble for anyone doing long-term fieldwork.\u201d She expressed reluctance to take part in any future studies in which the paleogenomicists alone set the pace. Her population-geneticist partner, Adam Powell, feels the same way. \u201cI really wanted for us to do things differently,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut didn\u2019t think it would be this hard. I\u2019m now going to focus my energies elsewhere.\u201d\\r\\nThe day after our night out at the kava bar, Colleran booked us on an Air Vanuatu flight to the northern island of Malekula to visit a remote village called Alpalak, which was roughly translated for me as \u201cthe place where if you go you will definitely die.\u201d There she introduced me to Chief Jimmyson Sanhambath, who sat and drank kava with me in the shifting shadows of a mango tree, heavy with unripe fruit. Sanhambath is an exceptionally vital man in his late 50s, with a slender, wiry physique, a thickly corded neck, and a long, smooth forehead and sharply angled jaws knitted together by a trim graying mustache. Asked about the spit that his people had given Colleran, he told me he had come to believe that there couldn\u2019t be anything in it; spit evaporates to nothing, after all. He admired Colleran and didn\u2019t want to trifle with her work, he insisted, but he continued with a mischievous grin, \u201cThey must just be making it up.\u201d\\r\\nThe next day, he took us through bamboo thickets to see some of the oldest cave art in the region. We crouched down through a dark opening, followed a short slope and emerged into a large, well-lit chamber; a single banyan had snaked its way up and through a skylight opening high above. As we passed into the midday twilight of the rear of the chamber, Sanhambath pointed out dark handprints of a mossy jade color high up on the smooth walls. Nearby were crisp figures with the heads of dogs and pigs and the bodies of men; they wore unmistakable versions of the penis sheaths associated even today with Sanhambath\u2019s community.\\r\\nArchaeologists said they were made by men who ate charcoal, chewed it up and spat it back onto the walls. The oldest dated back 2,600 years and looked at once hauntingly archaic and vividly recent. \u201cThey\u2019re not Lapita,\u201d Sanhambath said, gesturing at the drawings, which had been dated by radiocarbon to shortly after the Lapita period ended. \u201cBut so what?\u201d Besides, as much faith as he had in what the archaeologists said about pottery or bones, he just couldn\u2019t bring himself to believe them when they said these paintings were made by ancient men.\\r\\n\u201cThese paintings,\u201d he said quietly in the cave dark, \u201cwere made by the spirits.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1936711235,\"description\":\"Geneticists have begun using old bones to make sweeping claims about the distant past.

Some 90 percent of unvaccinated people exposed in proximity to an infected person will get it.\\r\\nBut the vaccine, when given in two doses \u2014 typically around age 1 and age 5 \u2014 is about 97 percent effective.\\r\\nHealth officials and sociologists say the reasons for low vaccination rates among the ultra-Orthodox are complex.\\r\\nIn part they are tied to the wider anti-vaccination movement globally, including concerns that the measles vaccine, which also protects against mumps and rubella, causes autism or other diseases. The idea has been widely debunked but persists in some circles.\\r\\nRabbi Yakov Horowitz, founder of Darchei Noam yeshiva in Monsey in Rockland County, said that some parents considering admission to his school agonized over giving their children vaccines because they had heard they were dangerous. His yeshiva insisted on them, he said, though he knew of others that did not.\\r\\n\u201cGood people, great parents were terrified,\u201d he said. \u201cThey felt that I was asking to give their children something that would harm them.\u201d\\r\\nAlexandra Khorover, general counsel for Refuah Health Center, one of the largest health providers in the Rockland community of Spring Valley, said her health workers had encountered \u201ca small pocket of people who are anti-vaccine who have been peddling this information, fostering confusion and fear.\u201d\\r\\nPart of the reluctance to vaccinate or allow a government health worker to enter the home, though, is cultural.\\r\\nSamuel Heilman, a Queens College sociology professor who studies the ultra-Orthodox, said that there is a \u201cfear of interference from the outside\u201d rooted in the community\u2019s origins in pre-World War II Europe. More recently, the ultra-Orthodox have fought back against other health department efforts, such as New York City\u2019s efforts to limit a controversial circumcision practice, metzitzah b\u2019peh, because of warnings from health officials that it causes herpes in infants.\\r\\n\u201cThey have accepted the idea that they live by different rules than others in the outside community,\u201d Mr. Heilman said.\\r\\nWhile this insularity allowed the measles to spread, it has also had a protective effect on wider public health, at least so far. In part because ultra-Orthodox Jews tend to attend their own religious schools and patronize their own shops and restaurants, the disease has remained in Orthodox circles, save for several infections among non-Jewish workers linked to their communities, health officials said.\\r\\nThe outbreak in New York and New Jersey can be traced to the rise of measles in Israel, where some 2,700 cases and two deaths were reported in 2018, centered in Jerusalem.\\r\\nIn Europe, which was the source of at least some of the Brooklyn infections, some 65,000 cases were reported in the year ending October 2018, with high concentrations in Balkan countries and Ukraine.\\r\\nAs measles spread in New York, public health officials swung into action. Some 40,000 fliers were printed in English, Yiddish, Spanish and other languages warning of the Israeli outbreak and calling for people to be vaccinated. Health officials met with rabbis and pediatricians, who sounded the alarm to their congregations and patients.\\r\\n\u201cWe are telling people the health department is looking out for your health,\u201d said Rabbi David Niederman, a community leader and executive director of the United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburg. \u201cThey are the experts and you should take the vaccinations.\u201d\\r\\nIn Rockland County, which includes the large ultra-Orthodox community of New Square, the authorities put 59 schools under \u201cexclusion orders,\u201d forbidding unvaccinated children to attend even if they had a valid religious or medical exemption to the vaccine. The orders are lifted when a school\u2019s vaccination rate reaches 95 percent, which state authorities consider protective of public health. Eighteen schools have had the orders lifted, officials said.\\r\\nIn Brooklyn, some children have been out of school for months because of similar exclusion orders by health officials, said Rabbi David Zwiebel, the executive director of Agudath Israel, an ultra-Orthodox umbrella organization. Tensions are high, with some parents still refusing to vaccinate because of health fears, and others relenting.\\r\\n\u201cThere has been some harsh language exchanged on both sides,\u201d Rabbi Zwiebel said.\\r\\nThe information campaign has had an impact. In Rockland County alone, more than 13,000 vaccines have been given since October.\\r\\nWhile the rate of infection has slowed regionwide, Rockland has recorded an uptick \u2014 18 new cases in January, after a drop in December.\\r\\nDr. Ruppert advised caution for all residents of Rockland County, particularly for parents of young infants and others who are not immunized, because just about everyone in the county shops at the same malls and box stores.\\r\\n\u201cRockland is a small county, and I consider everyone potentially exposed,\u201d she said.\\r\\nIn New York City, health officials had sounded a hopeful note after no new cases surfaced for a week.\\r\\n\u201cI think we have promising news, Dr. Zucker said on Jan. 9, \u201cbut I don\u2019t want to be optimistic too soon.\u201d\\r\\nThen on Wednesday, three cases were confirmed in Borough Park, indicating that the outbreak there has not come to an end.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1973712285,\"description\":\"The disease spread within ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities where vaccination rates are low and some are suspicious of government health workers.\\r\",\"title\":\"New York Confronts Its Worst Measles Outbreak in Decades\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"health.25.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"\u201cTodo tranqui\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s all good! \u2014 is a phrase you get used to hearing when you spend time in Uruguay. This small country has a laid-back vibe that\u2019s like Xanax for the soul, plus some of the best beaches in South America to boot.\\r\\nExploring them usually means renting a car in the capital, Montevideo, and cruising northeast to discover peaceful hippie communities, chic fish restaurants by the sand dunes, a newly lively water-sports scene and off-the-grid villages where you can sleep in a hammock and commune with sea lions.\\r\\nAnd you can do it on a budget: As of September, the government has discounted restaurant and rental car bills by 22 percent when paid with a foreign credit card (foreign travelers don\u2019t pay the country\u2019s value added tax, or IVA). Foreigners don\u2019t pay the IVA on hotels, either.\\r\\nThis regulation is in place until April and makes a huge difference in making the country affordable for visitors. While Uruguay is still mostly off the radar for North Americans, tourism numbers last year were up by 50 percent in some places. While the summer season runs from late December until the end of February, the warm weather actually begins in November and lingers until the end of March.\\r\\nThere are wineries to visit and whales to watch. But the main appeal of Uruguay, a progressive country wedged between two giants led by right-wing politicians, Argentina and Brazil, is taking it easy: Locals are as chilled out as it gets, more than 10 cars is a traffic jam and cows outnumber humans four to one.\\r\\nDriving up the coast could take five hours or, if taking time to explore each town, five days. Car rental companies \u2014 the usual international names like Hertz and some similarly priced local companies \u2014 are scattered throughout the city and at the airport.\\r\\nThe two-lane highway that curves up the coast from Montevideo is rarely crowded, except on Sunday evenings headed back into the capital, and you\u2019re more likely to be stuck behind an old rattletrap of a truck than to hit a line of cars. The road is well maintained, too, with gas stations along the way advertising hot water dispensers, essential for locals who go nowhere without their yerba mate tea. The countryside is flat and green, dotted with sheep and cows but few buildings once you leave Montevideo.\\r\\nThe first essential stop on the coastal route is Punta Ballena (Whale Point), about 75 miles up the coast. Here, on a spike of land jutting out into the water, is Casapueblo, once the home of one of Uruguay\u2019s best-known visual artists, Carlos P\u00e1ez Vilar\u00f3. It\u2019s now a museum filled with his colorful canvases (some in homage to his son, one of the survivors of the famous 1972 plane crash in the Andes). The eye-catching white stucco spikes and balconies of the building (there\u2019s a hotel attached) look almost Grecian standing out against the water, and the museum stays open until the spectacular sunset over the sea is finished each day. (Entry, 320 pesos or about $10.)\\r\\nA few miles away lies Punta del Este, favorite vacation spot of well-heeled Argentines and Brazilians, who party until dawn in the clubs and recover on the beach all day. It\u2019s the biggest concentration of glitz and glam in a country where jeans count as formal wear, and while it doesn\u2019t hold much appeal for the frugal traveler, it\u2019s worth stopping for a stroll along the beach and a quick selfie with Los Dedos, the \u201chand in the sand,\u201d an enormous sculpture of fingers emerging from the beach.\\r\\n For meals, avoid the pretentious overpriced dining rooms and head instead to Cantina del Vigia, where steaks, pizza and vegetables all take a turn in the twin wood-fired ovens before arriving at the simple wooden tables. Dinner for two, around 2,000 pesos.\\r\\nWhile Punta is all high heels and champagne, Jose Ignacio, a small beach community 45 minutes farther up the coast, is understated wealth. The dirt streets are home to elegant boutiques, and its top restaurant, La Huella, is a beach bar \u2014 though a beach bar with outstanding grilled fish and elegant cocktails. It\u2019s so popular that even if you make a reservation, you can easily wait an hour for your table; in laid-back Uruguayan fashion, there\u2019s no hurry. Sip on a chilled glass of a local sauvignon blanc as you wait; if the sea breeze gets chilly, they\u2019ll lend you one of the chic wool blankets they also offer for sale. It\u2019s more of a splurge: Lunch for two with drinks is around 2,500 pesos.\\r\\nJose Ignacio\u2019s modernist concrete and glass beach houses are some of the most beautiful in the country, and staying for a couple of nights to spend afternoons on the pristine beach is well worth it. Airbnbs are easy to come by, and a weekend in March in a well-equipped one-bedroom a block or two from the beach can be had for $250.\\r\\nCruising north from Jose Ignacio on Route 10 brings you to a singular quirk of infrastructure, Puente Laguna Garzon. This is a ring bridge designed by Uruguayan architect Rafael Vi\u00f1oly, and it makes a circle across the water of Laguna Garzon. Tempting as it is, you can\u2019t just drive around and around (it shunts you off) but you can walk around and take in the views of the kitesurfers practicing nearby. \\r\\nWind sports have taken off in Uruguay in recent years; now it\u2019s not just the fishermen who make their living from the lagoons. Surf schools have opened up, and you\u2019re likely to see kitesurfers and windsurfers making the most of the Atlantic breezes wherever you go.\\r\\nThe farther up the coast you get, the more bohemian the country becomes, but before driving to more northern beach towns, take a detour about 30 miles inland to Bodega Garz\u00f3n, the country\u2019s premier winery. Built from local stone and glass, the modernist winery boasts extraordinary views of vineyards, rolling hills, ponds and beautifully tended fields from its hilltop perch. The absolute quiet of the space, disturbed only by the occasional hare, capybara or long-tailed lizard, is a reminder of how empty much of the country\u2019s interior is. \\r\\nThe winery\u2019s temperate climate and proximity to the sea make the wine, especially its albari\u00f1os and tannats, some of the country\u2019s most complex. An afternoon here \u2014 particularly if you splurge on lunch at the on-site restaurant, where the menu was conceived by Argentine fire-master Francis Mallmann \u2014 is a delight, and a last gasp of upscale indulgence (with concomitant prices) before entering the department of Rocha, where everything immediately becomes much more laid-back. Tours with tastings range between 800 and 2,500 pesos depending on the wines sampled, while a five-course lunch comes in at 4,300 pesos, not including booze.\\r\\nIn the high season, turning off the highway in Rocha onto the main street in La Pedrera means encountering a swarm of people. The strip, Avenida Principal, is filled from morning to well after midnight with holidaymakers; in La Pedrera, you\u2019ll encounter everyone from groups of 20-somethings staying at campsites and forming drum circles to parents herding gaggles of young children down to the beach. Craggy rocks make for fabulous views, but the beaches themselves, especially Playa del Barco to the south and Punta Rubia to the north, are wide, clean and good for swimming. After an afternoon in the sun, settle in at one of the patio tables at Costa Brava, overlooking the crashing waves below, with a plate of the ultimate Uruguayan beach snack, bu\u00f1uelos \u2014 bright green dough balls with seaweed fried to crispiness (350 pesos) \u2014 and a bottle of cold white wine.\\r\\nBook ahead to reserve a second-floor room at Brisas La Pedrera (doubles start around $150), around the corner from the Avenida Principal. They come with balconies facing the ocean, and beach chairs and sun hats are provided.\\r\\nWhat\u2019s most striking about Uruguay\u2019s coastal towns is what they don\u2019t have: high-rises (except in Punta, which even has a Trump Tower), chain restaurants and hotels, overdeveloped beaches. Each beach might have a parador, where you can buy a cold bottle of Zillertal, one of the national beers that\u2019s big enough for two, but otherwise they\u2019re mostly empty of commercialism. Someone might stop by your beach chair to try to sell you a sandwich, a pot cookie or some handmade jewelry, but because this is Uruguay, they\u2019re never pushy, taking rejection with perfect equanimity and a smile.\\r\\nGet a glimpse of local life with a lunch stop 10 miles south of La Pedrera. On the edge of the Laguna de Rocha, separated from the Atlantic by a narrow strip of land, is a wooden deck dotted with plastic chairs and tables. This is Cocina de la Barra, a small restaurant run by the wives and daughters of the fishermen who make their living from the lagoon. The stock of fresh shrimp, crab and delicately fried fish come straight from the small fishing boats into the kitchen, a delightful community partnership that began three years ago. Lunch, eaten off plastic plates, is a bargain at around 800 pesos for two.\\r\\nIf you want to truly get off the grid, Cabo Polonio is perhaps the country\u2019s most desirable spot. Though it\u2019s the least accessible coastal village in Uruguay, sitting within an undeveloped national park, it\u2019s also one of the most beautiful. It requires some forethought to reach: trucks that can cross the sand dunes barring the way depart on regular schedules from a bus station off the main road (round trip 230 pesos, plus another 100 if you want to bring your surfboard), or you can walk along the beach the six or so miles from Valizas, the next town to the north.\\r\\nCabo Polonio\u2019s remoteness is treasured by its handful of year-round inhabitants. While the town\u2019s hostels and bare-bones restaurants get busy in the summer, there\u2019s virtually no Wi-Fi and electricity is minimal: Generators create enough refrigeration for a cold beer at an open-air restaurant, but not for a light in your dorm room (a bed in a dormitory in either the Viejo Lobo or Cabo Polonio Hostel costs around $30 a night, cash only). You can hear honking from the colony of sea lions gathered under the lighthouse, and it\u2019s possible to see whales from September to November. This part of the coast can still feel wild, particularly in the off-season, when the only thing you\u2019ll encounter on the beach is the occasional cow that has lost its way.\\r\\nPunta del Diablo is the last significant beach town before the Brazilian border, and its unevenly paved streets and ramshackle restaurants get crowded in the high season, with families spending entire days on the miles-long stretch of beach and groups of young people filling the bars in the evenings. Its small restaurants and shacks selling carved mate gourds and seashell mobiles are pushed up from the sea in a semicircle, looking out onto rocks and waves that start accumulating surfers when the wind picks up in the evenings.\\r\\nMost shops will close between 2 and 5 p. m. \u2014 inconvenient if you\u2019re a North American who likes to dine at 6, but perfectly normal for a country that has dinner at 11. If you\u2019re here in the off-season, bring plenty of cash: A.T.M.s are only brought in for the summer months, and not every place takes a credit card.\\r\\n A series of shops selling fresh fish and seafood line the street overlooking the beach, although many locals still prefer to grill beef on the parrilla (grill) of their rental house (and you won\u2019t find a rental without one). V.R.B.O. and Airbnb have plenty of good options, but book as far in advance as possible, especially if you\u2019re here in the high summer. \\r\\nIt\u2019s worth spending an evening at Il Tano. This small restaurant with a tidy menu of housemade pastas and beautifully tender fresh shrimp also has a diverse wine list with plenty of Uruguayan options, including merlots, tannats and blends. It\u2019s one of the fancier restaurants in Punta del Diablo, but almost all the guests (and staff) will be in T-shirts. Dinner for two with wine comes in around 2,500 pesos. Spend the night at Posada Lune de Miel (doubles start around $80), a collection of red-painted cabins arranged around a pool. Each has a small living space that includes a tiny kitchen that\u2019s useful for stays of more than one night.\\r\\nFollow NY Times Travel on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

Or FUN USA? Why not BEER, or perhaps BREW, or even BOB.\\r\\nThere were markets to explore.\\r\\n\u201cVINO seems to be the biggest that would be the wine drinkers,\u201d Mr. Indiana\u2019s caretaker, Jamie L. Thomas, wrote in one of the text messages to Mr. Indiana\u2019s New York art publisher, Michael McKenzie.\\r\\n\u201cWorth a shot,\u201d Mr. McKenzie responded.\\r\\nTo what extent Mr. Indiana participated in these discussions, if at all, is now part of a continuing dispute in federal court in Manhattan, where the company that has the rights to create and sell works based off the LOVE design has sued the two men.\\r\\nThe company, Morgan Art Foundation, a for-profit entity, has accused the pair of taking advantage of Mr. Indiana\u2019s advanced age and isolation on a remote island off the coast of Maine to produce a bunch of inauthentic works that they sold under Mr. Indiana\u2019s name.\\r\\n\u201cWhen Mr. McKenzie was discussing the creation and sale of these new works,\u201d a lawyer for Morgan, Luke Nikas, wrote in a court filing this week, \u201che knew he was operating without Indiana\u2019s approval and that Indiana might even be mentally incompetent.\u201d\\r\\nThe Morgan company, which says bogus works damage Mr. Indiana\u2019s market and reputation, has previously challenged the authenticity of several works, including BRAT, a huge sculpture and homage to bratwurst that Mr. McKenzie sold to a Wisconsin sausage maker.\\r\\nNow, as part of the lawsuit it filed earlier this year, the company got access to days and days of private text messages between Mr. Thomas and Mr. McKenzie, in which the two men, the company says, seem to be inventing ideas independent of the artist.\\r\\n\u201cHey Michael I am going to send you a pic of a new idea I just came up with just give me a minute to draw it out,\u201d Mr. Thomas wrote in a message on May 1.\\r\\n\u201cAwesome can\u2019t wait to see it,\u201d Mr. McKenzie replied.\\r\\nMay 1, 2018\\r\\nOver the course of the next week or so, the two men went on to propose a succession of ideas for works in the style Mr. Indiana was known for \u2014 letters offset to make sculptural forms \u2014 and they discuss different themes, colors and potential markets.\\r\\nMr. McKenzie said in an interview that Mr. Indiana shared in any proceeds from works Mr. McKenzie had a hand in and that he believes the artist had signed off on all the ideas. Even if he had not, Mr. McKenzie said, Mr. Thomas, who held power of attorney for Mr. Indiana, fully understood the artist\u2019s wishes and had the authority to act on his behalf.\\r\\nMay 7, 2018\\r\\n\u201cJamie at one point becomes Robert Indiana in effect,\u201d Mr. McKenzie said. \u201cHis job is to try to earn money for the estate.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cJamie,\u201d he added, \u201cis head of Indiana Inc.\u201d\\r\\nCertainly the use of assistants in the creative process is not new to the art world, where major figures like Damien Hirst and Jeff Koons have outsourced the nitty-gritty of production to a bevy of assistants. In those cases, the artists have said that they conceived the ideas and lent a final imprimatur to the completed work.\\r\\nThe text messages suggest a wider gulf in which Mr. Indiana may not have been fully aware of the art being designed under his name.\\r\\n\u201cCan bob still speak on this or is he out of it,\u201d Mr. McKenzie asks at one point.\\r\\nIt is also clear, though, from the messages that the men were scanning Mr. Indiana\u2019s notebooks for inspiration, with the intent of trying to produce works based on old ideas that were in line with his aesthetic spirit. For example, Mr. Thomas sent Mr. McKenzie a photograph of a page from an Indiana notebook from 1969 that included scribbled ideas for works like \u201cHole\u201d and \u201cSoul.\u201d Mr. Thomas indicates that he had spoken to the artist about whether he had ever made a \u201cSoul\u201d work.\\r\\nIn addition to the BRAT sculpture, other works whose authorship by Mr. Indiana have been questioned are a set of works that display the lyrics of Bob Dylan and a sculpture, WINE, that was created and used for a magazine cover.\\r\\nIn the case of BRAT, James Brannan, Mr. Indiana\u2019s former lawyer who is the executor of Mr. Indiana\u2019s estate, said in an interview that he was tracking the proceeds from  the sale, which was arranged directly between Johnsonville Sausage and Mr. McKenzie. \u201cI want to make sure Mr. Indiana got his share of that money,\u201d he said.\\r\\nIn an earlier court filing, a lawyer for Mr. McKenzie said Mr. Indiana had received \u201cseveral hundred thousand dollars in royalties for BRAT.\u201d\\r\\nBeginning in 2008, Mr. McKenzie had a contract with Mr. Indiana to produce and sell works based on his sculpture \u201cHOPE.\u201d He said the contract called for him to pay Mr. Indiana $1 million a year, but since the HOPE works never earned $1 million annually, he had Mr. Indiana\u2019s approval to explore other ideas.\\r\\nIn the court papers, the lawyer for Mr. McKenzie, Raymond Dowd, said his client had paid Mr. Indiana \u201capproximately $10 million dollars in royalties since 2008.\u201d The court filing included copies of several checks, including one from March 2018 for $500,000 from Mr. McKenzie to Mr. Indiana.\\r\\n\u201cIndiana gets paid for every one of those ideas if they get greenlighted,\u201d Mr. McKenzie said in the interview.\\r\\nMr. Thomas could not be reached for comment. He and Mr. McKenzie have previously denied that they isolated or mistreated Mr. Indiana. In fact, Mr. McKenzie has argued in court papers that it was Morgan Art Foundation that had not fully paid Mr. Indiana for the Indiana artworks it was making, something the company denies.\\r\\nJohn D. Frumer, a lawyer for Mr. Thomas, said that his client \u201cremains confident that when the full evidentiary record is developed it will demonstrate that the claims against him are baseless.\u201d\\r\\nMr. McKenzie said in the interview that Mr. Indiana gave them wide leeway to create new works, in part because the artist hoped the money could be used to renovate his home on the island of Vinalhaven and turn it into a museum that honors his artistic legacy. In his will, Mr. Indiana named Mr. Thomas as executive director of a foundation that will have a huge role in stewarding Mr. Indiana\u2019s legacy, including the museum.\\r\\nThe energy Mr. Thomas was putting into creating ideas was in the spirit of fulfilling Mr. Indiana\u2019s dream, Mr. McKenzie said. \u201cHe was hustling, but on Bob\u2019s behalf,\u201d he said.\\r\\nIt is clear in the text messages that the men knew Mr. Indiana was ailing and that the time to produce works under his name was shrinking.\\r\\n\u201cIf it is done while bob is alive it is art,\u201d Mr. McKenzie wrote in a message about two weeks before Mr. Indiana\u2019s death, \u201cafter that an estate collectible.\u201d\\r\\nRead more of the text exchange between Michael McKenzie and Jamie Thomas from May 2018, the month Robert Indiana died:\\r\\nProduced by Josephine Sedgwick.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":309217200,\"description\":\"Private text messages entered as evidence in a legal dispute raise new questions about whether the artist fully designed his final works.\\r\",\"title\":\"His Art, Their Ideas: Did Robert Indiana Lose Control of His Work?\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"business.28.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"John E. Merow, a former chairman of the venerable Wall Street law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, who presided over its expansion as it opened offices overseas and pushed into areas like mergers and acquisitions, died along with his wife, Mary Alyce Merow, on Jan. 12 in a fire in their Manhattan apartment.\\r\\nMr. Merow was 89, and Mrs. Merow was 85.\\r\\nA Fire Department spokesman said that the cause of the fire was under investigation, but that it was not considered suspicious. It started in the Merows\u2019 ninth-floor apartment at River House, a prestigious 27-story building, built in 1930, along the East River at East 52nd Street. The building is also home to former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and the actress Uma Thurman.\\r\\nThe Fire Department said 78 firefighters and Emergency Medical Services responders were sent to the scene, and five suffered minor injuries.\\r\\nMr. Merow, a lawyer whose clients included Kaiser Aluminum and affiliates of the mining company Rio Tinto, took the reins of century-old Sullivan & Cromwell in 1987, a time when Wall Street firms were broadening their services. No longer were they what the author Louis Auchincloss, who had worked at Sullivan & Cromwell from 1946 to 1951, called \u201cgreen goods firms\u201d \u2014 those that dealt mainly with securities offerings.\\r\\nOn Mr. Merow\u2019s watch, Sullivan & Cromwell opened offices in Los Angeles, Melbourne and Tokyo.\\r\\n\u201cHe admitted that he preferred when the Japanese prevented foreign firms from operating there, because it was so expensive,\u201d Nancy Lisagor, a co-author of \u201cA Law Unto Itself: The Untold Story of the Law Firm of Sullivan & Cromwell\u201d (1988), recalled in an email, \u201cbut once the laws changed, the firm had to be there because, he said, \u2018They have all the money in the world.\u2019 \u201d\\r\\nMr. Merow became chairman as Japanese companies were making big purchases in the United States, from Hollywood to Wall Street, with Mitsubishi buying control of Rockefeller Center and Sony spending $3.4 billion for Columbia Pictures. But Sullivan & Cromwell was facing crises close to home.\\r\\nOne involved allegations about another senior partner, George C. Kern Jr., who had founded the firm\u2019s mergers and acquisitions practice. The Securities and Exchange Commission charged that Mr. Kern had violated securities disclosure rules while defending Allied Stores in a hostile takeover bid by the Campeau Corporation.\\r\\nThe firm, under Mr. Merow, supported Mr. Kern. \u201cJohn made it very clear that the firm was going to stick 100 percent behind him,\u201d H. Rodgin Cohen, the firm\u2019s senior chairman, said in an interview. \u201cThere were people who said, \u2018Maybe we should ask George to leave the firm.\u2019 I don\u2019t think anybody thought he had done anything wrong, but as a firm it could be reputationally damaging. John was not going to even begin to countenance that.\u201d\\r\\nAn administrative law judge ruled against Mr. Kern but did not impose sanctions. The S.E.C. eventually dropped efforts to set a penalty.\\r\\nMr. Merow stepped down as chairman in 1994.\\r\\nHe was born on Dec. 20, 1929, in Little Valley, N.Y., southwest of Buffalo, the son of Luin and Mildred Merow. He graduated from the University of Michigan in 1952 and served on a destroyer as a lieutenant in the Navy in the Korean War before going to Harvard Law School, where he met Mary Alyce Smith, who was working on the staff of The Harvard Law Review.\\r\\nThey were married in 1957. Mr. Merow joined Sullivan & Cromwell after he received his law degree.\\r\\nMs. Lisagor said Mr. Merow had loosened policies and practices at the firm. But the traditions of lawyerly etiquette and camaraderie prevailed, at least in public.

It\u2019s our answer to Europe\u2019s cathedrals, our proof of a unique national identity. \\r\\nMost citizens were first introduced to the wilderness by images. In the early 19th century, Thomas Cole placed the eastern wilderness \u2014 his beloved Catskill Mountains \u2014 on walls. Later in the century, Carleton Watkins\u2019s 1861 photographs of Yosemite contributed heavily to Lincoln\u2019s decision in 1864 to secure the valley forever \u201cfor public use, resort and recreation,\u201d the first time any government anywhere set aside land to benefit the public. \\r\\nWilliam Henry Jackson\u2019s 1871 photographs of Yellowstone helped persuade Congress to establish the first national park in 1872. Then in the 1930s, Ansel Adams (1902-1984), a staunch conservationist who had grown up near the windswept dunes of Golden Gate Park, lobbied Congress and sent the government a book of his photographs of the southern Sierra Nevada range. They strongly influenced President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s decision to make the Kings Canyon area a national park. \\r\\nLate in the 19th century virtually every home had a viewer for 3-D stereographs of a West that looked like a fable. Manifestly \u2014 in mind-set as well as mission \u2014 the West was our destiny.\\r\\nAnd now it is bracing \u2014 if perhaps cautionary \u2014 to see, close to the moment that the government shutdown has affected many of the national parks, so many noble and challenging images of our country\u2019s heritage starring in \u201cAnsel Adams in Our Time,\u201d at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. It is a far-ranging, smartly and instructively installed show of more than 100 of his photographs. \\r\\nNot a mere retrospective, it also includes about 80 images by 23 contemporary photographers that the curator, Karen Haas, sees as a modern lens on Adams. Although the connections are occasionally a bit tenuous, their addition highlights how Adams, who carried the 19th century\u2019s hymn to America into the 20th century, has remained an inescapable force.\\r\\nThe photographers on view who adapt Adams\u2019s images simultaneously make radical changes and commentaries. Their inclusion points out major shifts in the way both landscape photography and landscape itself are now regarded.\\r\\nAlthough Adams gave his heart to the 19th century, he trained his eye on modernism and the \u201cstraight photography\u201d of the 1930s, with its sharp focus, vivid contrast and compositions that amounted to studies in form and light. His iconic and still breathtaking mountainscapes of Yosemite and elsewhere are on view, as well as such semiabstract landscapes as \u201cSand Dunes, Sunrise, Death Valley National Monument, California,\u201d which could stand comfortably beside an Edward Weston. \\r\\nMost come from the Lane Collection, a munificent gift of more than 450 Adams photographs to the M.F.A. There are surprises too, like the breadth of Adams\u2019s interests (and the extent of his need to earn a living with commissions and magazine work), from Native Americans to ghost towns, from a World War II Japanese internment camp to cemeteries, churches, a cigar store Indian, a highway interchange.\\r\\nLike Ralph Waldo Emerson, Adams experienced a heightened spirituality in the wilderness that spoke to a longing for the beauties, peace and spectacle of untrammeled nature \u2014 a yearning that lingers strongly in our time, suggesting it might be innate. \\r\\nHe was 14 when he first visited Yosemite. He quickly took his Kodak into that stupendous valley and was so moved by the experience that it changed his life. Adams meant his images to convey the emotions he experienced while taking pictures and then heightening their impact in the darkroom. (He was a superb printer.) How lucky it is for the arts that human vision, though it does not register the world in black and white, can respond to colorless representation on a level within reach of its response to color.\\r\\nLandscape tourism grew exponentially from the post Civil War years to today, but untouched wilderness has dwindled as the population increased and migrated to cities and suburbs, while mining, drilling and industrialization encroached on open spaces. Adams, though well aware of how commercialized the national parks had become, could scarcely have anticipated that on summer weekends the grounds bordering the Grand Canyon would look like Woodstock. \\r\\nHe preferred the parks pristine, and Eadweard J. Muybridge\u2019s 19th-century photograph of Yosemite Valley with a logging road cutting across it is paired at the M.F.A. with Adams\u2019s image of the same place, the road carefully retouched out.\\r\\nPhotographers took note of how \u201cprogress\u201d had changed the land. In the 1960s and 1970s, the movement called New Topographics signaled a radical shift from traditional depictions of the land to the many ways we had altered it.\\r\\nRobert Adams, Lewis Baltz and others photographed what had once been purple mountains\u2019 majesty \u2014 mountains now more likely to tower above rutted lanes and ticky-tacky houses. Adams took some note as well. His photograph of a housing development is at the M.F.A., as is his picture of a pensive cemetery statue that makes it clear that the cemetery borders on a forest \u2014 of oil derricks.\\r\\nThe New Topographers were determined to acknowledge the slow decline of wilderness, which had been trampled in part by the lingering wish to be near nature, a wish that bit its own tail. Many of the houses destroyed by the recent Northern California fires were located in what\u2019s called the wildland-urban interface, dangerously close to forests. \\r\\nIn the late 1970s, a group called the Rephotographic Project figured out exactly where and in what season some important 19th-century landscape photographers had stood, then made photographs at the exact same times and places. The landscape, often enough, was quite recognizable but equally often overrun or partially obstructed by buildings.\\r\\nNonetheless, art and commercial photographers today still photograph beautiful landscapes beautifully. Landscape photographs are everywhere, thanks to Instagram, providing proof that wilderness still exists, although it may be outnumbered by its portraits.\\r\\nSOME CONTEMPORARY PHOTOGRAPHERS ask a vital question of art history: What can be done with a scene that long ago became an icon and is tattooed upon our minds? The answer lies with what artists have done with icons for centuries: They have reinterpreted them.\\r\\nMark Klett and Byron Wolfe incorporated pieces of earlier photographs into their own collaboration on exhibit here, stitching a time sequence into a single image. They photographed the view from Glacier Point overlook at exactly the spot where Carleton Watkins had stood, then replaced portions of their color photograph with a fragment of Adams\u2019s and a fragment of Watkins\u2019s photographs of the same view.\\r\\nCatherine Opie takes highly colored, out-of-focus pictures of Adams\u2019s territory in the national parks. In a video at the exhibition she said that she wants people to know what they are looking at but to question it, an act of witnessing that one click on an iPhone, one glance at social media, does not create.\\r\\nAbelardo Morell converted a dark, sealed tent into a camera obscura. An image of what an attached periscope saw was projected through its angled mirror onto the tent\u2019s ground. He then photographed that underfoot image and printed it just as it was, showcasing America the beautiful through smatters and tatters of grass and dirt, as if the soles of our shoes had risen up to insist they were as essential to viewing as the view itself.\\r\\nBinh Danh took daguerreotypes of Yosemite, a reversal of time and history. Daguerreotypes, made without a negative, are unique. They were introduced in 1839, never widely used for landscapes, and largely replaced by a negative process by the time Watkins photographed Yosemite in 1861. Their surface is reflective, so Binh Danh\u2019s viewers see themselves looking at images of iconic places that they themselves are in.\\r\\nOther contemporaries report on the many lasting changes human hands have made on the landscape. Mark Ruwedel photographs the tunnels and cuts that railroads long ago carved through the West at terrible cost and later abandoned \u2014 useless paths to nowhere slicing across the land.\\r\\nMitch Epstein\u2019s \u201cAltamont Pass Wind Farm\u201d suggests that human interference has reached an implausible level. The wind farm sits in a barren desert, but where the windmills end a glistening green golf course begins, equipped with a concrete lane for golf carts. Where did, where does, the water come from? And the dirt? It may be ironic to plunk an entire course down beside a sand trap, but the 19th-century idea that God meant us to tame and reconfigure the land for our use did not have this in mind.\\r\\nDavid Emitt Adams also photographs a deranged landscape, printing tintypes (another 19th-century process) of landscape details onto sculptures he made of old, beat-up, discarded metal cans he collected in the desert, where they pepper the ground. A new role for the desert: prime dump.\\r\\nThough Adams remains extravagantly popular and landscape photographers across America and the world continue to provide us with luscious images, probably the largest number of landscape photographs people see, on television, the web, on mobile and in newspapers, are images of environmental destruction that is at least partially due to climate change: flooded beaches, rivers, towns, and islands, shrinking glaciers, forest fires feeding on drought, hurricane damage of cities and fields. All scientific predictions say this will grow worse unless strong action is taken soon.\\r\\nBeautiful landscapes are good for the eye, the mind, the spirit. \\r\\nOne day images of them may be all that we have left.\\r\\nAnsel Adams in Our Time\\r\\nThrough Feb. 24 at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; 617-267-9300, mfa.org.\\r\\nRelated Exhibition\\r\\nThrough March 3, the Addison Gallery of American Art at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., has on view \u201cContemplating the View: American Landscape Photographs,\u201d an exceptional photography exhibition with examples of Adams\u2019s work.\\r\\n\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1247966159,\"description\":\"The National Parks are in partial shutdown.

That acute pain is letting you know that a part of your body needs to heal, or in some other way needs extra attention, said Dr. Neil Schechter, the director of the chronic pain clinic at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital.\\r\\nThat\u2019s very different, he said, from chronic pain that goes on over the course of months, whether abdominal pain or headache or musculoskeletal \u2014 it may persist and be incapacitating, because \u201cthe pain has become the disease.\u201d\\r\\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the pain is any less painful for the person experiencing it.\\r\\n\u201cThere is really strong evidence supporting the psychological treatment for chronic pain, and that doesn\u2019t imply that the pain itself is a psychological problem,\u201d said Rachael Coakley, a psychologist who is the director of clinical innovation and outreach in pain medicine at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital. Her book, \u201cWhen Your Child Hurts,\u201d is an excellent resource for parents.\\r\\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re a kid and you\u2019ve had pain for a really long time, a lot of that is an experience of not having control over what\u2019s happening in your body,\u201d said Anna C. Wilson, a pediatric pain psychologist at Oregon Health and Science University. \u201cRelaxation and other biobehavioral techniques help kids gain a sense of control.\u201d\\r\\nShe tells patients, \u201cYour pain is absolutely real, and chronic pain in particular is a neurologic problem.\u201d She recommended TED Talks by Dr. Elliot Krane, an anesthesiologist, and Lorimer Moseley, a neuroscience professor, to help explain chronic pain.\\r\\nChronic pain develops, Dr. Schechter said, when there is an underlying biological vulnerability, either inherited or resulting from stressors like infections or procedures or traumas, and then a triggering event, such as a gastrointestinal infection or an injury.\\r\\nAs many as one in five children may experience chronic pain, which is defined as lasting for three months or more, Dr. Coakley said. They may reduce their activities because of the pain, missing school and falling behind, which brings additional stress and anxiety. They may also need psychological help with anxiety and depression because they have lived with chronic pain and its consequences. \\r\\nBut children often do better in recovering from chronic pain than adults do, Dr. Schechter said, because their brains and their nervous systems are more plastic. With proper treatment, \u201cthe majority of children are significantly helped with pain problems, and for many the pain disappears completely,\u201d he said.\\r\\n[Read more on dealing with chronic pain. | Sign up for the Well Family newsletter.]\\r\\nIn the United States,  about four to eight million children  have missed school in the last months because of pain, said Dr. Stefan Friedrichsdorf, the medical director of pain medicine and palliative care at Children\u2019s Minnesota. \\r\\nThe best place for these children to get care, Dr. Friedrichsdorf said, is in a pediatric pain clinic. Ideally, the children are seen by a team including a physician or nurse practitioner, a designated pain psychologist, a physical therapist, and a social worker whose job includes taking care of the parents.\\r\\nPediatric pain clinics are available in 26 states. If there is no clinic near where a family lives, or if the waiting list is prohibitively long, Dr. Friedrichsdorf recommends that parents try to put a team together themselves: Work with your pediatrician to find a physical therapist and a psychologist who can help.\\r\\nThe most important message for these children and parents, who often have already gone from doctor to doctor experiencing one diagnostic procedure after another, he said, is \u201cwe explain to them why the pain is real, and a large number of the kids actually start crying because they feel not believed.\u201d The experts reassure children and their families that the pain will usually go away, but it will take a lot of hard work.\\r\\nChildren who live with chronic pain have often cut back all their normal activities, and the priority, Dr. Friedrichsdorf said, is to get \u201cthe four S\u2019s\u201d back to normal: school, sports, social life and sleep. \u201cFirst you go back to school full time, and second you get better; it\u2019s not the other way around,\u201d he said.\\r\\nThere may be a lot of fear and anxiety that movement and exercise will hurt, Dr. Wilson said, but \u201cthe pain they\u2019re experiencing is not a message that something threatening or dangerous is happening, and once the family understands that, it\u2019s easier to work toward having the kid do more movement, and movement is really essential.\u201d Chronic pain, Dr. Schechter said, \u201cis hurtful but not harmful.\u201d\\r\\nDr. Coakley said: \u201cI\u2019ll often say that having chronic pain is like a tricycle with three flat tires, and to get them going again we have to fill each of the tires.\u201d One tire might be filled with medications \u2014 and rather than painkillers, these might include drugs that treat the nervous system, from certain antidepressants to seizure medications. Another tire might be filled with an activity program, and a third with cognitive behavioral therapy, she said.\\r\\nChildren can learn mind-body techniques such as diaphragmatic breathing, guided imagery, mindfulness and biofeedback. Dr. Coakley compared these to \u201cdimmer switches\u201d for the nervous system, dialing down the sensitivity. And children and parents can use what she called \u201ccircuit-breaker strategies\u201d to disrupt the habit cycles and behavior patterns that have built up around chronic pain.\\r\\nShe asks parents to stop checking in frequently about how a child is feeling so children won\u2019t be thinking, \u201chow do I feel now, do I hurt, and how much?\u201d\\r\\nChristine Chambers, a professor and children\u2019s pain researcher at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, said she tells families that \u201cthe pain system is supposed to work like your body\u2019s alarm system and tell you when something is wrong.\u201d Usually that alarm system works very well for acute pain, she said, but \u201cwhen you have a lot of pain early in life, the alarm system can start to malfunction, and you see the pain alarm system going off even though there is no acute reason.\u201d\\r\\nChildren need to learn strategies to turn the oversensitive alarm down, or to pay less attention to it.\\r\\nDr. Coakley founded a program called the Comfort Ability, which offers one-day workshops at sites around the country for adolescents and their parents, teaching strategies for understanding and managing chronic pain (financial assistance is often available, and there are many resources on the website as well).\\r\\n\u201cHow we approach and treat chronic pain often feels counterintuitive at the beginning of the journey,\u201d said Dr. Coakley. Parents may feel that focusing on pain management means that the medical system has stopped looking for the underlying problem, she said, but in fact, \u201cthe vast majority of the kids we treat in this multidisciplinary approach get better \u2014 this is actually the treatment for the problem.\u201d\\r\\nThis is the third in a series of columns on children\u2019s pain.

However, great artists of anger have taught us how cathartic a rousing roar can be, especially when the object of rage is not a conjured scapegoat but a clear and present danger. One of the greatest of those artists in living memory \u2014 the singer, pianist, composer Nina Simone \u2014 lambasted the disasters of American racism. Does she have something to teach those of us dealing with cancer-related tragedies?\\r\\nIn 1963, after the killings of Medgar Evers and of four little girls in the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ms. Simone began producing a number of anthems for the civil rights and black power movements. One of her most powerful songs continues to be all too relevant.\\r\\nThe lyrics of \u201cMississippi Goddam,\u201d I thought, might serve me while cancer\u2019s casualties stun me. By tweaking Nina Simone\u2019s words, would I implicitly be comparing rampant racism to metastatic disease or vice versa? I could live with that analogy, as Susan Sontag \u2014 the public intellectual who rejected all metaphors of illness \u2014 once did.\\r\\nMs. Simone reinvented other refrains created by writers of many different ethnicities and nations, shaping them to her purposes. In doing so, she has emboldened me to recycle some of her stanzas for people from diverse backgrounds who live with cancer. When borrowing is acknowledged, after all, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.\\r\\nHere, then, is a homage to Nina Simone that I hope will lead you to listen to her terrific rendition of \u201cMississippi Goddam.\u201d In an aside within this edgy elegy of damaged lives, she calls it \u201ca show tune, but the show hasn\u2019t been written for it yet.\u201d I also feel as if I have been watching a show that hasn\u2019t been written yet.\\r\\nAfter too many cancer-related setbacks and deaths of relatives, friends, and correspondents \u2014 you readers could not be more moving about your own bereavements \u2014 I started belting Nina Simone\u2019s protest with new words, invigorated by her spirit of indignant fury.

But deep down, you\u2019re not sure where to start. Sure, you can buy accounting software, sign up for a service or poke around your bank\u2019s online offerings for money management. But don\u2019t overlook what is probably the best option of all: a simple and free spreadsheet you make yourself.\\r\\nNever used spreadsheet software before and not quite sure what it does? Relax, using it to make a budget is easy, because someone has already done most of the work. Here\u2019s how to get started.\\r\\nStep 1: Pick Your Program\\r\\nFirst, select an application that can create and edit spreadsheet files. Microsoft Excel has long been a core component of the Microsoft Office suite for Mac and Windows ($70 a year). If you don\u2019t have it already, you can also find versions for Android and iOS or the free basic version that runs in a web browser.\\r\\nOther free or preinstalled spreadsheet programs may already be on your device. Google Sheets (for Android, iOS and web) and Apple\u2019s Numbers software for iOS, macOS and web are two examples.\\r\\nIf you don\u2019t care for the offerings from Microsoft, Google or Apple, there are alternatives. Apache OpenOffice has a Calc spreadsheet program, as does LibreOffice, and both are free open-source suites that run on Windows, Mac and Linux systems. And there are plenty of other options in the app stores if you want to shop around.\\r\\nStep 2: Select a Template\\r\\nSpreadsheet programs for home computers have been around for 40 years, giving developers plenty of time to make them more intuitive. Most have a version of the \u201cpersonal budget\u201d template \u2014 with the spending categories, design and formulas already formatted. Take advantage of them. Just type over the sample numbers with your own information and the software does the math.\\r\\nOpen your program of choice and look for the \u201cTemplate\u201d or \u201cProject\u201d gallery. Select the template that best matches your needs, like \u201cMonthly Home Budget,\u201d to create a new spreadsheet.\\r\\nDon\u2019t see a template that suits you? With a quick search, you can find plenty more to download online, like the selection at BudgetsAreSexy.com, which has specialized templates for those aiming for early retirement, or recent college graduates. The Measure of a Plan personal finance site also has a detailed budget-tracking template that works in Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets. Online video tutorials and software guides can also help you build your own spreadsheets.\\r\\nStep 3: Enter Your Own Numbers\\r\\nOnce you open a template, you\u2019ll see the boxes (called \u201ccells\u201d in spreadsheet lingo) to fill in your own numbers. Gather up pay stubs, bills, statements and any other forms that show what you made or spent that month.\\r\\nEnter the information into the designated place. Along with your salary, your pay stub should show the money taken out for things like taxes, retirement savings and health insurance. Add in monthly expenses, like phone, credit card and power bills; car loans; gas, insurance, rent and mortgage costs; gym fees; restaurant meals; and shopping sprees.\\r\\nStep 4: Check Your Results\\r\\nOnce you have all your numbers punched into the spreadsheet, you can see two things.

Sustained drops in confidence often signal dampened consumer spending in the months ahead, and can be the precursor to broader economic downturns.\\r\\nOn Friday, the University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index fell to the lowest point of the Trump presidency, well below forecasters\u2019 expectations. Analysts attributed the drop largely to the partial government shutdown, which has entered its fifth week.\\r\\nEconomic confidence also fell, across nearly all demographic groups, in a poll conducted this month for The New York Times by the online research firm SurveyMonkey.\\r\\n\u201cIf you have that many people in the economy that are not getting paychecks, are not able to pay their rent, pay their mortgages, there\u2019s going to be a broad macroeconomic impact,\u201d said Kevin Stay, a 27-year-old survey respondent in Pittsburgh. \u201cThat\u2019ll affect everything. It\u2019ll ripple through the economy.\u201d\\r\\nBusiness groups on Friday called on the president and Congress to reopen the government immediately.\\r\\n\u201cThe current shutdown \u2014 now the longest in American history \u2014 is causing significant and in some cases lasting damage to families, businesses and the economy as a whole,\u201d the groups wrote in a letter posted on the website of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\\r\\nThe SurveyMonkey poll found that Americans remained relatively upbeat about their personal finances, particularly Democrats and independents, whose assessment of their family\u2019s economic situation has brightened since the November elections. But a wide swath of respondents reported increasing worries about the economy over all.\\r\\nNearly a third of respondents to the poll said the United States economy was worse off than it was a year earlier. That\u2019s up from fewer than a quarter of respondents in January 2018. And respondents were nearly as likely to say the next five years will bring \u201cperiods of widespread unemployment or depression\u201d as \u201ccontinuous good times economically.\u201d As recently as November, optimists outnumbered pessimists on that question by more than 10 percentage points.\\r\\nThe Michigan survey found something similar: Respondents were still fairly positive about the current economy but were far more negative about the future.\\r\\nMr. Stay works for a technology company and hasn\u2019t suffered personally from the standoff between Mr. Trump and Democrats in Congress. But he said the shutdown had nonetheless made him more cautious. He recently moved home from Colorado and is living with family; he had intended to get his own apartment, but he has delayed those plans partly because of the uncertainty surrounding the shutdown.\\r\\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to go out and make a major purchase if you\u2019re worried the economy\u2019s about to take a major downturn,\u201d Mr. Stay said. \u201cI work in sales. My income is pretty directly tied to how the whole economy is doing.\u201d\\r\\nBy most conventional measures, the economy is still doing well. The unemployment rate is near a five-decade low, wage growth is accelerating, and overall economic growth in 2018 was on track to be the strongest since before the 2008-9 recession.\\r\\nBut cracks had begun to show even before the shutdown idled hundreds of thousands of federal workers shortly before Christmas. The stock market dropped precipitously late in the year as investors became concerned about the effects of a trade war with China, among other factors, and the housing market has slowed. Many economists had already expected growth to slow in 2019 as the effects of the tax cuts that took effect last year begin to wane.\\r\\nThose fears seemed to have little effect on consumers, whose spending powered a strong holiday shopping season and fueled economic growth for much of last year. Any hints that consumers are growing jittery are worrisome, said Stephen Stanley, chief economist for Amherst Pierpont Securities.\\r\\n\u201cThe consumer\u2019s really the star of the show right now, and if you were to see any signs of a break there, it would be significant,\u201d Mr. Stanley said.\\r\\nDownturns in consumer sentiment don\u2019t always translate into cutbacks in actual spending. And past shutdowns haven\u2019t done lasting damage to either confidence or spending. Jim O\u2019Sullivan, the chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics, wrote in a research note that the Michigan index also fell in 2013, then bounced back quickly when the government reopened. But he cautioned that the current shutdown had already outlasted any previous one.\\r\\nAdding to the challenge for forecasters, the shutdown has stopped the release of much government economic data. The Commerce Department, for example, was scheduled to release retail sales figures for December e this week; that report has been put off indefinitely.\\r\\n\u201cDisentangling what is temporary effects and what is the underlying trend becomes that much more difficult,\u201d said Brett Ryan, an economist with Deutsche Bank in New York. \u201cIt just adds more uncertainty during a period when the market\u2019s already skittish.\u201d\\r\\nIn the absence of much hard evidence, economists have been left guessing about the shutdown\u2019s impact. White House economists this week doubled their estimate of the damage being inflicted. The Council of Economic Advisers said the shutdown would reduce quarterly economic growth by 0.13 percentage points for every week that it lasted as federal contractors lost out on work and government employees went without pay.\\r\\nSome analysts see even bigger potential effects: Deutsche Bank estimated on Thursday that in the worst case, the economy could contract in the first quarter because of an extended shutdown.\\r\\nPortions of the surveys offered a pointed political warning to Mr. Trump. In the span of a year of SurveyMonkey polling, the president has lost much of the approval he enjoyed with Americans on economic policy. Nearly as many respondents now say his policies are making the economy worse as say they are making the economy better. A year ago, Mr. Trump held a seven-percentage-point advantage on that question.\\r\\nAs a retiree in Arizona, Pat Cafferata hasn\u2019t felt the effects of the shutdown firsthand. And although she watches the markets with interest, she said she wasn\u2019t too worried that an economic slowdown would force her to make a major change to her way of life.\\r\\nBut she is worried about the people who are missing paychecks, and about the larger effects of a prolonged shutdown. She pointed to reports that past shutdowns ended up costing taxpayers more than keeping the government open.\\r\\n\u201cThat is such a waste of money in an era when we don\u2019t have enough money to waste on things like that,\u201d she said.\\r\\nA former advertising executive, Ms. Cafferata, 74, viewed the shutdown through a business lens.\\r\\n\u201cAny government shutdown is a reflection of poor management,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t run a business this way, and to run a country this way is just terrible.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1098402478,\"description\":\"Consumer-sentiment readings are declining, and more Americans rate President Trump\u2019s economic policies poorly, as the impasse in Washington drags on.\\r\",\"title\":\"Polls Show Government Shutdown Is Eroding Faith in Economy\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"business.30.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"(Want to get this briefing by email?

Activity at factories has slowed as the trade war with the U.S. begins to bite. And the real estate market has stagnated.\\r\\nWhy it matters: For years, China\u2019s economy has been a major driver for growth around the world and a slowdown there is one of the many reasons the global economy is decelerating.\\r\\nWhat\u2019s next? The Chinese government is already trying to help the economy reverse course.

Another study has found Greenland\u2019s ice loss had reached its fastest rate in at least 350 years.\\r\\nWhy it matters: The study is the latest in a series of papers published this month suggesting that scientific estimates of the effects of a warming planet have been, if anything, too conservative. Researchers say they collectively underline the need for a sharp reduction in emissions.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere\u2019s what else is happening\\r\\nWarning to Beijing: More than 100 prominent scholars and former diplomats, including two former U.S. ambassadors, signed an open letter cautioning that the detention of two Canadians threatens the flow of ideas with China essential for policy work and research aimed at narrowing international rifts. The letter calls for the immediate release of the Canadians, who were detained last month after Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei, was arrested in Canada.\\r\\nCrackdown on young communists: Chinese activists say the authorities have been forcing them to watch taped confessions from fellow student activists who say they spread false information and violated the law. It\u2019s the government\u2019s latest effort to quell a resilient pro-labor movement fed by the ideas of Mao, Marx and Lenin, which are required subjects at China\u2019s universities.\\r\\nGenetically edited babies: He Jiankui, the Chinese scientist who said in November that he had used the Crispr gene-editing technique to alter human embryos, \u201cseriously violated\u201d state regulations, according to an initial government report.

Half of the users who looked at the Facebook page with that data \u2014 known as their \u201cAd Preferences\u201d \u2014 said they were not comfortable with the company\u2019s compiling that information. Pew conducted a nationally representative survey of 963 American adults with Facebook accounts between Sept. 4 and Oct. 1 of last year.\\r\\nWhile consumers have learned more in recent years about how they are targeted for online ads, the study suggests that many still do not know how much of their behavior is tracked, where it is compiled or even that Facebook has a page that lists all of that information. Pew focused on Facebook, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, because it \u201cplays an incredibly important role in the media ecosystem of the world,\u201d said Lee Rainie, Pew\u2019s director of internet and technology research.\\r\\n\u201cPrivacy matters to Americans \u2014 it\u2019s a classic American value \u2014 yet when they\u2019re online and doing other things, they act as if their personal information is O.K. to harvest and analyze,\u201d Mr. Rainie said in an interview. \u201cOne of the theories on this inconsistency is that Americans don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on. The fact that 74 percent of Facebook users didn\u2019t know that these lists were maintained on them cuts to the heart of that question of where Americans are, or are not, with these systems.\u201d\\r\\nAbout 88 percent of the users had listings on their Ad Preferences page. The page says that it allows users to \u201clearn what influences the ads you see and take control over your ad experience.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cPew\u2019s findings underscore the importance of transparency and control across the entire ad industry, and the need for more consumer education around the controls we place at people\u2019s fingertips,\u201d Joe Osborne, a Facebook spokesman, said in a statement. \u201cThis year we\u2019re doing more to make our settings easier to use and hosting more in-person events on ads and privacy.\u201d\\r\\nTargeted advertising is the core of Facebook\u2019s business, which brings in more than $40 billion in revenue each year. Through all the clicking, posting and article sharing, and activity elsewhere online, Facebook builds up an ad profile for each of its users. That includes information as basic as their age and location, as well as their hobbies, political leanings, family type and more. Advertisers use that information to direct tailored messages to users.\\r\\nBut questions around how that data can be misused to manipulate people \u2014 and how much they know about its collection in the first place \u2014 have put tech companies like Facebook on the defensive.

The vast majority of American small businesses are organized as pass-throughs, whose profits are divided up among owners and taxed as individual income. Many financial firms and real estate companies \u2014 including hundreds that are under the umbrella of the Trump Organization \u2014 are also set up as pass-throughs.\\r\\nThe regulation includes several changes from a proposal the Treasury Department issued in August. It now allows certain mutual-fund holders to benefit from the deduction if they have holdings in a real estate trust. It also provides far greater detail on the type of service businesses that are excluded from claiming the deduction above a certain income threshold. The law\u2019s drafters have said that limitation was meant to prevent certain high-earning individuals, such as lawyers, from reclassifying individual income as pass-through income, in order to reduce their tax bills.\\r\\nSome of those details appear likely to disappoint business leaders who urged Treasury to broaden the definition of what sorts of companies qualify for the full deduction. Major League Baseball owners, for example, had pushed to be eligible after the draft regulations excluded them.\\r\\n\u201cSports clubs are engaged in a multifaceted business that involves activities and operations relating to selling media rights, tickets, concessions, signage rights, sponsorships, merchandise and other goods, managing real estate, and creating entertainment content,\u201d the M.L.B. commissioner, Robert D. Manfred Jr., wrote in a comment on the proposed regulations. \u201cThis is in stark contrast to accounting firms, law firms, consulting firms, investment banking firms, and health care practices, whose sole and narrow business is to engage in the performance of professional services for their customers.\u201d\\r\\nThe final regulations still exclude them.\\r\\nThe nation\u2019s largest small-business advocacy group, the National Federation of Independent Business, welcomed the regulation. It provides \u201cneeded certainty to small business owners,\u201d said Brad Close, senior vice president of public policy and advocacy. \u201cThe vast majority of small businesses will enjoy the benefits of the full 20 percent deduction.\u201d\\r\\nA companion regulation issued on Friday would allow owners of rental properties to claim the deduction provided they keep certain records and perform 250 hours a year of \u201crental services\u201d on the property \u2014 either by themselves or by hiring someone to do it. Those guidelines would appear to allow some Americans who rent rooms or other property through sites such as Airbnb to qualify for the full deduction, though not if they live in the property at any time during the year.\\r\\nThe guidelines also exclude some of the largest landlords in the country, because they rent to tenants using so-called triple-net leases that call for tenants to pay all real estate taxes, maintenance and building insurance. \u201cI am very surprised they did what they did,\u201d said Anthony J. Nitti, a tax partner at Withum in Aspen, Colo., who has written extensively on pass-through regulations. \u201cIt creates this strange dichotomy.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Nitti said winners under the new regulations include assisted living facilities and employment staffing companies, which appear now to qualify for the full deduction without limitations. Losers include radiologists and possibly chiropractors, who appear not to qualify, he said.\\r\\nNicole Kaeding, director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation in Washington, said the regulations would likely lead to lawsuits that force courts to determine whether many individual businesses qualify.\\r\\n\u201cIt is a generous deduction that encourages individuals to try and take advantage,\u201d she said. \u201cThe I.R.S. regulations could be perfect and still, the beneficial tax treatment will ensure that accountants and attorneys will seek to innovative on new business structures and forms to maximize the deduction.\u201d\\r\\nTreasury is one of the agencies where funding has lapsed during the government shutdown, meaning its employees are either furloughed or working without pay. The department has recalled tens of thousands of workers to process tax refunds and aid taxpayers during tax filing season, which is scheduled to open at month\u2019s end.\\r\\nOn Friday, officials told reporters that the shutdown had delayed release of the final pass-through regulations by one or two weeks. Other regulations governing provisions of the Trump tax cuts remain under development by the department. Officials said they have identified \u201chigh priority\u201d regulations and focused resources in order to complete them in time for filing season.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1398502267,\"description\":\"The Internal Revenue Service issued regulations governing a 20 percent deduction for so-called pass-through companies.\\r\",\"title\":\"Trump Administration Spells Out Who Wins and Loses From New Tax Break\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"business.29.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Alan R.

By the mid-1970s, ARP was the leading synthesizer manufacturer, commanding 40 percent of the market and outselling its predecessors and competitors, Moog and Buchla.\\r\\nARP sounds were central to numerous songs, including Edgar Winter\u2019s \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d Herbie Hancock\u2019s \u201cChameleon,\u201d Kraftwerk\u2019s \u201cThe Robots,\u201d Underworld\u2019s \u201cRez,\u201d Nine Inch Nails\u2019 \u201cThe Hand That Feeds\u201d and the early-1980s version of the theme to the television series \u201cDoctor Who.\u201d\\r\\nThe five-note signature motif of \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind\u201d was played on an ARP 2500 synthesizer, which is seen in the film. An ARP 2600, mixed with natural sounds, provided the voice of R2-D2 in the first \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie.\\r\\nAlan Robert Pearlman was born on June 7, 1925, in Manhattan and grew up in Bridgeport and Milford, Conn. His father, Julius, designed projectors for movie theaters. His mother, Ada (Jacobs) Pearlman, was a homemaker.\\r\\nMr. Pearlman, whose childhood nickname was Arp, liked to describe himself as being a nerd \u201cbefore the term was invented,\u201d according to \u201cAnalog Days\u201d (2002), a history of synthesizers by Trevor Pinch and Frank Trocco. Mr. Pearlman was devoted to engineering and research, not corporate development or the pop music business; he amassed more than 20 patents.\\r\\n\u201cMy father was not a fame seeker; he was humble almost to a fault,\u201d Dina Pearlman said in a telephone interview. \u201cIf he put his mind to something and he knew there was a better solution, he found it.\u201d\\r\\nGrowing up, Mr. Pearlman took piano lessons and built ham radio sets. He served briefly in the Army at the end of World War II. He studied engineering at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts, where his senior thesis project, in 1948, involved electronic music. It was a vacuum-tube envelope follower, which could sense the \u201cenvelope\u201d \u2014 the attack, volume, sustain and decay shaped by a musician \u2014 of a note played on an instrument.\\r\\n\u201cWith greater attention on the part of the engineer to the needs of the musician,\u201d Mr. Pearlman wrote in the accompanying paper, \u201cthe day may not be too remote when the electronic instrument may take its place as \u201ca versatile, powerful and expressive instrument.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Pearlman, who lived in Newton, married Buena Alcalay in 1958. She and his daughter survive him.\\r\\nMr. Pearlman worked for NASA designing amplifiers for Gemini and Apollo spacecraft, then helped found Nexus Research Laboratory, which built precision solid-state analog modules, including operational amplifiers.\\r\\nNexus was sold to Teledyne in 1967, the year Morton Subotnick\u2019s \u201cSilver Apples of the Moon,\u201d an album-length electronic composition made on a Buchla synthesizer, was released. Mr. Pearlman was impressed, and in 1968, after hearing \u201cSwitched-On Bach\u201d by Wendy (known at the time as Walter) Carlos \u2014 a hit album of Bach pieces recorded on a Moog via overdubbing and editing \u2014 he decided to work again on electronic instruments.\\r\\n\u201cI went into the basement and did some playing around,\u201d Mr. Pearlman told Inc. magazine in 1982.\\r\\nMr. Pearlman founded ARP, initially named Tonus Inc., in 1969. Early synthesizers tended to go rapidly out of tune. Mr. Pearlman solved that problem by placing two functions on the same chip, and that stability became a major selling point.\\r\\nThe company\u2019s first instrument was the ARP 2500, a large console-size synthesizer introduced in 1970; it was acquired by many universities for electronic-music laboratories. The 2500 used a matrix of switches to connect its modules instead of patch cords, which the Moog used. The slightly less bulky ARP 2600, using patch cords but also including built-in preset connections, arrived in 1971. Like other early synthesizers, they were monophonic, playing just one note at a time.\\r\\nThe ARP Odyssey was duophonic (able to play two notes at once), far more portable and easily comprehensible to synthesizer neophytes. It caught on rapidly among musicians.\\r\\nOther ARP models followed: the even smaller Pro-Soloist, with preset sounds; the String Ensemble; and the polyphonic Omni, which became the company\u2019s best seller. At its peak, in 1977, ARP\u2019s annual sales were $7 million, the equivalent of about $29 million today.\\r\\nBut against Mr. Pearlman\u2019s wishes, ARP\u2019s other top management turned the company\u2019s resources away from keyboards to develop the Avatar guitar synthesizer, a commercial failure. ARP went bankrupt in 1981, costing stockholders and creditors $4 million; Mr. Pearlman and his family lost $500,000.\\r\\nThe last product developed by ARP, the Chroma velocity-sensitive polyphonic synthesizer, was sold to CBS Musical Instruments and became profitable there.\\r\\nMr. Pearlman went on to start a computer-graphics company, Selva Systems, and later worked for Mini-Systems, a component manufacturer. In the 1980s he worked for a time with Ray Kurzweil, whose Kurzweil Music Systems was developing new instruments. In recent years, Mr. Pearlman had grown concerned with global warming and was designing improved technology for wind power.\\r\\nMeanwhile, musicians clung to vintage ARP instruments. In the digital era, software programmers strove to emulate ARP\u2019s sounds and interface. Mr. Pearlman was a consultant on the TimewARP 2600, a software version of the ARP 2600. In 2015, the Japanese instrument company Korg revived ARP\u2019s trademarks and made an updated ARP Odyssey in both physical and software versions.\\r\\nMr. Pearlman maintained a lifelong interest in music.

Its lightning-rod recommendation is around beef and lamb, the two forms of livestock that require enormous amounts of land and water and produce heaps of methane. \\r\\nThe report suggests a dramatic reduction in red meat consumption for people who eat a lot of it, like Americans and Canadians, but not the world\u2019s poor, who need more animal protein for better health \u2014 like children in South Asia.\\r\\nWritten by 37 scientists from 16 countries and published Wednesday in the medical journal The Lancet, in conjunction with an advocacy group called the EAT Forum, the report was funded by the Wellcome Trust and Stordalen Foundation. In addition to the recommendations on meat, it calls for curbing food waste, a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, and overhauling agriculture so it doesn\u2019t worsen deforestation and the depletion of scarce water. \\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a blanket approach, but when you look at the data there are certain individuals or populations that don\u2019t need that much red meat for their own health,\u201d said Jessica Fanzo, a professor of food policy at Johns Hopkins University and a co-author of the report. \u201cThere\u2019s a real inequity. Some people get too much. Some people get too little.\u201d\\r\\nPeople in North America eat more than 6 times the recommended amount of red meat, the report said, while countries in South Asia eat half of what\u2019s recommended.\\r\\nAgriculture accounts for roughly a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions, much of them produced by the raising of cattle and lamb. With the world\u2019s population projected to rise to 10 billion by 2050 and prosperity allowing many more people to afford meat and dairy, scientists and policymakers are paying more attention to the question of feeding the planet without destroying it. \\r\\nOne recent study by the World Resources Institute recommended that people in Europe and the United States reduce their meat consumption. But like the Lancet report, it, too, suggested that reducing the carbon footprint of food would also require rapid changes in farming methods to allow farmers and ranchers to grow far more food on existing agricultural lands while cutting emissions. \\r\\nThe Lancet report pointed to a broader problem of disparity: More than 800 million people don\u2019t get enough to eat worldwide, the report noted, and many more \u201cconsume low-quality diets that cause micronutrient deficiencies and contribute to a substantial rise in the incidence of diet-related obesity and diet-related noncommunicable diseases.\u201d \\r\\nThe report took pains to say that it wasn\u2019t trying to prescribe to people what to eat or how to eat. It laid out global targets for what constitutes a healthy diet, based on an average intake of 2,500 calories a day. That includes 14 grams, or about half an ounce, of beef or lamb a day. That\u2019s roughly the equivalent of a McDonald\u2019s Quarter Pounder every eight days. \\r\\nThe report said the largest share of daily calories, 35 percent, should come from whole grains, including rice, wheat and corn, and starchy tubers like potatoes and cassava. The recommendations included unsaturated fats, milk, cheese and nuts, and lots of green vegetables. Overall, the guidelines called for a doubling of global consumption of fruits, nuts, vegetables and legumes, and cutting the consumption of red meat in half.\\r\\nThe meat reduction recommendation received immediate pushback. Even before the release of the Lancet report, the Animal Agriculture Alliance, an industry group, issued a statement extolling the benefits of meat and dairy. It said cutting animal protein could \u201crisk worsening malnutrition, increasing food waste, and distracting from the highest priorities for addressing greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d The group echoed the Lancet report\u2019s recommendation to reduce food waste.\\r\\nLikewise, the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association, in a statement, called beef \u201cnourishing and sustainable.\u201d\\r\\nThe Lancet report also made clear that individual consumer choices would not be enough to avert what the authors called \u201ccatastrophic damage to the planet.\u201d It urged governments to encourage healthy food choices and ensure access to nutritious food. It also suggested that global agriculture policy emphasize not just producing more food, but more \u201cnutritious plant-based foods,\u201d though it acknowledged that, in some places, animal farming can be good for the ecosystem. \\r\\nIt recommended policies to curb deforestation and to protect at least 10 percent of marine areas from fishing. To tackle food waste, it suggested help for farmers in poor- and middle-income countries to better store their crops and get them to market while still fresh. In rich countries, it encouraged better shopping habits and improved \u201cuse by\u201d labels.\\r\\n\u201cThe evidence says we can do it,\u201d said Tim Lang, a professor of food policy at the City University of London and a co-author of the report. \u201cThere\u2019s an immense diversity of what people can eat.

But we\u2019re only starting to come to grips with the potential economic effects.\\r\\nUsing increasingly sophisticated modeling, researchers are calculating how each tenth of a degree of global warming is likely to play out in economic terms. Their projections carry large bands of uncertainty, because of the vagaries of human behavior and the remaining questions about how quickly the planet will respond to the buildup of greenhouse gases.\\r\\nA government report in November raised the prospect that a warmer planet could mean a big hit to G.D.P. in the coming decades.\\r\\nAnd on Thursday, some of the world\u2019s most influential economists called for a tax on carbon emissions in the United States, saying climate change demands \u201cimmediate national action.\u201d The last four people to lead the Federal Reserve, 15 former leaders of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, and 27 Nobel laureates signed a letter endorsing a gradually rising carbon tax whose proceeds would be distributed to consumers as \u201ccarbon dividends.\u201d \\r\\nThe Trump administration has long rejected prescriptions like a carbon tax. But policy debates aside, many of the central economic questions of the decades ahead are, at their core, going to be climate questions. These are some of the big ones.\\r\\nHow permanent will the costs be? \\r\\nWhen we think about the economic damage from a hotter planet, it\u2019s important to remember that not all costs are equivalent, even when the dollar values are similar. There is a big difference between costs that are high but manageable versus those that might come with catastrophic events like food shortages and mass refugee crises. \\r\\nConsider three possible ways that climate change could exact an economic cost:\\r\\n A once-fertile agricultural area experiences hotter weather and drought, causing its crop yields to decrease. \\r\\nA road destroyed by flooding because of rising seas and more frequent hurricanes must be rebuilt.\\r\\n An electrical utility spends hundreds of millions of dollars to build a more efficient power grid because the old one could not withstand extreme weather.\\r\\nThe farmland\u2019s yield decline is a permanent loss of the economy\u2019s productive capacity \u2014 society is that much poorer, for the indefinite future. It\u2019s worse than what happens in a typical economic downturn. Usually when factories sit idle during a recession, there is a reasonable expectation that they will start cranking again once the economy returns to health.\\r\\nThe road rebuilding might be expensive, but at least that money is going to pay people and businesses to do their work. The cost for society over all is that the resources that go to rebuilding the road are not available for something else that might be more valuable. That\u2019s a setback, but it\u2019s not a permanent reduction in economic potential like the less fertile farmland. And in a recession, it might even be a net positive, under the same logic that fiscal stimulus can be beneficial in a downturn.\\r\\nBy contrast, new investment in the power grid could yield long-term benefits in energy efficiency and greater reliability. \\r\\nThere\u2019s some parallel with military spending. In the 1950s and \u201960s, during the Cold War, the United States spent more than 10 percent of G.D.P. on national defense (it\u2019s now below 4 percent).\\r\\nMost of that spending crowded out other forms of economic activity; many houses and cars and washing machines weren\u2019t made because of the resources that instead went to making tanks, bombs and fighter jets. But some of that spending also created long-term benefits for society, like the innovations that led to the internet and to reliable commercial jet aircraft travel.\\r\\nCertain types of efforts to reduce carbon emissions or adapt to climate impacts are likely to generate similar benefits, says Nicholas Stern, chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics.\\r\\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t provide sea defenses at large scale without very heavy investment, but it\u2019s not investment of the kind that you get from the things that breed technological progress,\u201d Mr. Stern said. \u201cThe defensive adaptations don\u2019t carry anything like the dynamism that comes from different ways of doing things.\u201d\\r\\nThere is more fertile ground in areas like transportation and infrastructure, he said. Electric cars, instead of those with internal combustion engines, would mean less air pollution in cities, for example. \\r\\nHow should we value the future compared with the present?\\r\\nSeeking a baseline to devise environmental regulations, the Obama administration set out to calculate a \u201csocial cost of carbon,\u201d the amount of harm each new ton of carbon emissions will cause in decades ahead.\\r\\nAt the core of the project were sophisticated efforts to model how a hotter earth will affect thousands of different places. That\u2019s necessary because a low-lying region that already has many hot days a year is likely to face bigger problems, sooner, than a higher-altitude location that currently has a temperate climate.\\r\\nMichael Greenstone, who is now director of the Becker Friedman Institute at the University of Chicago and of the Energy Policy Institute there, as well as a contributor to The Upshot, was part of those efforts. \\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019ve divided the world into 25,000 regions and married that with very precise geographic predictions on how the local climate will change,\u201d Mr. Greenstone said. \u201cJust having the raw computing power to be able to analyze this at a more disaggregated level is a big part of it.\u201d\\r\\nBut even once you have an estimate of the cost of a hotter climate in future decades, some seemingly small assumptions can drastically alter the social cost of carbon today.\\r\\nFinance uses something called the discount rate to compare future value with present value. What would the promise of a $1,000 payment 10 years from now be worth to you today? Certainly something less than $1,000 \u2014 but how much less would depend on what rate you use.\\r\\nLikewise, the cost of carbon emissions varies greatly depending on how you value the well-being of people in future decades \u2014 many not born yet, and who may benefit from technologies and wealth we cannot imagine \u2014 versus our well-being today.\\r\\nThe magic of compounding means that the exact rate matters a great deal when looking at things far in the future. It\u2019s essentially the inverse of observing that a $1,000 investment that compounds at 3 percent a year will be worth about $4,400 in 50 years, whereas one that grows 7 percent per year will be worth more than $29,000.\\r\\nIn the Obama administration\u2019s analysis, using a 5 percent discount rate \u2014 which would put comparatively little weight on the well-being of future generations \u2014 would imply a social cost of $12 (in 2007 dollars) for emitting one metric ton of carbon dioxide. A metric ton is about what would be released as a car burns 113 gallons of gasoline. A 2.5 percent rate would imply a cost of $62, which adds up to hundreds of billions of dollars a year in society-wide costs at recent rates of emissions.\\r\\nThe Obama administration settled on a 3 percent discount rate that put the social cost of carbon at $42 per metric ton. The Trump administration has subsequently revised that estimate to between one dollar and seven dollars.\\r\\nThat sharp decrease was achieved in part by measuring only the future economic costs to the United States, not factoring in the rest of the world. And the Trump administration analyzed a discount rate of up to 7 percent \u2014 a rate at which even costs far into the future become trivial.\\r\\nMr. Greenstone favors substantially lower discount rates, based on evidence that financial markets also place high value on investments that protect against risk. \\r\\nUnderstood this way, spending today to reduce carbon emissions tomorrow is like insurance against some of the most costly effects of a hotter planet \u2014 and part of the debate is over how much that insurance is really worth, given that the biggest benefits are far in the future. \\r\\n\\r\\nHow might climate change fuel inequality?\\r\\nWhen a government report raises the possibility of a 10 percent hit to G.D.P. as a result of a warming climate, it can be easy to picture everyone\u2019s incomes being reduced by a tenth.\\r\\nIn reality there is likely to be enormous variance in the economic impact, depending on where people live and what kind of jobs they have.\\r\\nLow-lying, flood-prone areas are at particularly high risk of becoming unlivable \u2014 or at least uninsurable. Certain industries in certain places will be dealt a huge blow, or cease to exist; many ski slopes will turn out to be too warm for regular snow, and the map of global agriculture will shift.\\r\\nAdaptation will probably be easier for the affluent than for the poor. Those who can afford to move to an area with more favorable impacts from a warmer climate presumably will.\\r\\nSo the economic implications of climate change include huge shifts in geography, demographics and technology, with each affecting the other.\\r\\n\u201cTo look at things in terms of G.D.P. doesn\u2019t really capture what this means to people\u2019s lives,\u201d said William Nordhaus, a Yale economist who pioneered the models on which modern climate economics is based and who won a Nobel for that work. \u201cIf you just look at an average of all the things we experience, some in the marketplace and some not in the marketplace, it\u2019s insufficient. The impact is going to be highly diverse.\u201d\\r\\nCan we adapt to a warmer climate?\\r\\nDespite all these risks, it\u2019s important to remember that humanity tends to be remarkably adaptable. A century ago, most people lived without an automobile, a refrigerator, or the possibility of traveling by airplane. A couple of decades before that, almost no one had indoor plumbing.\\r\\nChanges in how people live, and the technology they use, could both mitigate the impact of climate change and ensure that the costs are less about a pure economic loss and more about rewiring the way civilization works.\\r\\nMost capital investments last only a decade or two to begin with; people are constantly rebuilding roads, buildings and other infrastructure. And a warmer climate could, if it plays out slowly enough, merely shift where that reinvestment happens.\\r\\nBut a big risk is that the change happens too quickly. Adaptation that might be manageable over a generation could be impossible \u2014 and cause mass suffering or death \u2014 if it happens over a few years.\\r\\nImagine major staple food crops being wiped out for a few consecutive years by drought or other extreme weather. Or a large coastal city wiped out in a single extreme storm.\\r\\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s jobs, consumption patterns or residential patterns, if things are changing so fast that we can\u2019t adapt to them, that will be very, very costly,\u201d Mr. Nordhaus said. \u201cWe know we can adapt to slow changes. Rapid changes are the ones that would be most damaging and painful.\u201d \\r\\nIt\u2019s clear that climate change and its ripple effects are likely to be a defining challenge of the 21st-century economy. But there are wide ranges of possible results that vary based on countless assumptions. We should also recognize that the economic backdrop of society is always changing. Projecting what that will mean for ordinary people is not simply a matter of dollars.\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent the last 20 years trying to communicate it and it\u2019s not easy to process,\u201d Joseph Aldy, who teaches at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School for Public Policy, said of the connection between climate change and the economy. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to convey something that is long term and gradual until it\u2019s not.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1948748778,\"description\":\"Many of the big economic questions in coming decades will come down to just how extreme the weather will be, and how to value the future versus the present.\\r\",\"title\":\"Climate Change\u2019s Giant Impact on the Economy: 4 Key Issues\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.29.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"The European Union sanctioned on Monday two senior Russian military intelligence officials and two of their officers blamed for poisoning a former Russian double agent in Britain last year, a decision Moscow dismissed as groundless.\\r\\nThe European Union\u2019s travel bans and asset freezes included two men Britain has named as intelligence officers, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, who are accused of attempting to murder the former spy, Sergei V.

Now Microsoft, arguing that the industry has an interest and responsibility to help people left behind in communities transformed by the boom, is putting up $500 million to help address the problem.\\r\\nMicrosoft\u2019s money represents the most ambitious effort by a tech company to directly address the inequality that has spread in areas where the industry is concentrated, particularly on the West Coast. It will fund construction for homes affordable not only to the company\u2019s own non-tech workers, but also for teachers, firefighters and other middle- and low-income residents.\\r\\nMicrosoft\u2019s move comes less than a year after Amazon successfully pushed to block a new tax in Seattle that would have made large businesses pay a per-employee tax to fund homeless services and the construction of affordable housing. The company said the tax created a disincentive to create jobs. Microsoft, which is based in nearby Redmond, Wash., and has few employees who work in the city, did not take a position on the tax.\\r\\nThe debate about the rapid growth of the tech industry and the inequality that often follows has spilled across the country, particularly as Amazon, with billions of taxpayer subsidies, announced plans to build major campuses in Long Island City, Queens, and Arlington, Va., that would employ a total of at least 50,000 people. In New York, elected officials and residents have raised concerns that Amazon has not made commitments to support affordable housing.\\r\\nMicrosoft has been at the vanguard of warning about the potential negative effects of technology, like privacy or the unintended consequences of artificial intelligence. Executives hope the housing efforts will spur other companies to follow its lead.\\r\\n\u201cWe believe everybody has a role to play, and everybody needs to play their role,\u201d said Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer.\\r\\nThe company\u2019s strong finances, a sign of its resurgence under Satya Nadella as chief executive, have given it resources to deploy, Mr. Smith said. In October, the company reported net income of $8.8 billion in its most recent quarter, up 34 percent, and it had almost $136 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet. The company\u2019s stock has risen steadily under Mr. Nadella, and Microsoft is now valued at over $800 billion.\\r\\nA number of other tech businesses have tried to address the homeless crisis. Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, has supported homeless service providers through his personal foundation, and the Salesforce chief executive, Marc Benioff, helped fund a proposition in San Francisco to tax businesses to pay for homeless services. Voters approved the tax in November, rejecting opposition from some tech leaders, including Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey.\\r\\nOthers plan to build housing for their own employees. Such housing may help with demand, but it has also reinforced the impression that the companies are focused too closely on their own backyards.\\r\\n\u201cThis is long-range thinking by a company that has been around for a long time, and plans to be around for a long time,\u201d said Margaret O\u2019Mara, a professor at the University of Washington who studies the history of tech companies.\\r\\nMicrosoft began researching the region\u2019s housing last summer, after the nasty tax fight in Seattle and around a peak of the housing market. The company analyzed data and hired a consultant to decide how to focus its work. The area\u2019s home prices have almost doubled in the past eight years, and Mr. Smith said he learned that \u201cthe region has counterintuitively done less to build middle-income housing than low-income housing, especially in the suburbs.\u201d\\r\\nThat squeeze hits a range of workers. \u201cOf course, we have lots of software engineers, but the reality is that a lot of people work for Microsoft. Cafeteria workers, shuttle drivers,\u201d Mr. Nadella said this week at a meeting with editors at the company\u2019s headquarters. \u201cIt is a supply problem, a market failure.\u201d\\r\\nMicrosoft plans to lend $225 million at subsidized rates to preserve and build middle-income housing in six cities near its Redmond headquarters. It will put an additional $250 million into low-income housing across the region. Some of those loans may be made through the federal programs that provide tax breaks for low-income housing.\\r\\nThe company plans to invest the money within three years, and expects most of it to go to Seattle\u2019s suburbs.\\r\\nThe loans could go to private or nonprofit developers, or to governmental groups like the King County Housing Authority. As the loans are repaid, Mr. Smith said, Microsoft plans to lend the money out again to support additional projects.\\r\\nThe remaining $25 million will be grants to local organizations that work with the homeless, including legal aid for people fighting eviction. The Seattle Times reported Wednesday that if the $500 million were put into one project, it would create only about 1,000 units, so instead Microsoft will most likely put smaller amounts in many projects to help build \u201ctens of thousands of units.\u201d\\r\\nThe initial reaction to the company\u2019s announcement was positive.\\r\\n\u201cThere is almost no level of housing that isn\u2019t direly needed,\u201d said Claudia Balducci, a member of the King County Council who helps lead the Regional Affordable Housing Task Force.\\r\\nA report in December by the task force said that the region needs 156,000 more affordable housing units, and will need 88,000 more units by 2040 to accommodate future growth.\\r\\nA growing body of research has tied the lack of affordable housing to increasing homelessness. A December study from the real estate website Zillow said that was particularly true when households pay more than a third of their income in rent. The New York, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle regions \u2014 the country\u2019s largest tech hubs \u2014 have all already crossed that threshold.\\r\\n\u201cThe idea that you can live in your bubble and put your fingers in your ears just doesn\u2019t work anymore,\u201d said Steve Schwartz, head of public affairs at Tableau Software, which is based in Seattle.\\r\\nAmazon in recent years has worked closely with Mary\u2019s Place, a homeless shelter for women and children in Seattle, and is integrating a shelter for about 65 families into one of its new buildings. Amazon has paid tens of millions of dollars to the city\u2019s affordable housing trust fund as fees to build in the core of Seattle.\\r\\nAmazon declined to comment.\\r\\nGoogle supported the City of Mountain View\u2019s plan to add 10,000 housing units in an area it\u2019s developing, with 20 percent designated for lower-income residents. And Facebook has planned to build 1,500 apartments near its Menlo Park headquarters, with 15 percent to be affordable.\\r\\nMicrosoft has begun a major overhaul of its main campus in Redmond, committing billions of dollars in renovations and connecting it to a light rail station under construction. The company helped finance a successful campaign for voters to approve more property taxes to pay for transportation. This new investment in housing takes its commitments a step further.\\r\\n\u201cThis is where Microsoft is going to be, and the region needs to work,\u201d Ms. Balducci said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is wholly altruism.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":772145717,\"description\":\"The move is the most ambitious effort yet by a tech company to fund construction for local teachers, firefighters

opposition leaders offered amnesty to members of the armed forces who turned their backs on the government and helped establish a transitional government that would convene fair elections.\\r\\nThe United States and several governments in the region have backed the opposition\u2019s plan, but leaders of the movement acknowledge that getting the armed forces to flip will be the toughest hurdle.\\r\\nIt was not immediately clear how many service members were taken into custody after security forces surrounded the military installation. Neighbors reported hearing clashes as nearby residents banged pots and pans, apparently in a show of support for the mutinous troops.\\r\\nVenezuela\u2019s military said the rebellious soldiers had stockpiled weapons. \u201cThese subjects will face the full weight of the law,\u201d the military said in a statement.\\r\\nDiosdado Cabello, president of the Constituent Assembly, a legislative body packed with Maduro loyalists, said the service members who had participated in the uprising had been \u201cneutralized, defeated and captured in record time.\u201d He added in a series of messages posted on Twitter that the men were \u201cconfessing details\u201d and that they had turned on the government after being offered \u201cvillas and castles.\u201d\\r\\nJuan Guaid\u00f3, the recently installed president of the National Assembly, who is leading the effort to establish a transitional government, called the soldiers\u2019 actions \u201ca show of the generalized feeling\u201d in the armed forces after Mr. Maduro was sworn in for a second term, on Jan. 10. His re-election in May was widely condemned as rigged, and the United States and several Latin American governments have said they do not consider him a legitimately elected leader.\\r\\n\u201cOur troops know that the chain of command is broken due to the usurpation of the presidency,\u201d Mr. Guaid\u00f3 wrote on Twitter on Monday. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the security forces to split apart or clash, we want them to stand united on the side of the people, the Constitution and against the usurpation.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Maduro first came to power in a snap vote after the death of President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in 2013, after the former leader anointed him successor. He has tightened his grip on power over the years, and unrest within the armed forces has grown. Dozens of Venezuelan military officers have been detained in recent months on suspicion of plotting coups.\\r\\nAs residents in the area of the uprising awoke to the sound of clashes, many took to the streets to support the rebelling troops, according to videos posted online. Seeking to keep protests from growing, security officers fired tear gas, according to residents.\\r\\nThe beginning of Mr. Maduro\u2019s new term drew an international outcry that has left the Venezuelan government more isolated than ever before. It also invigorated the opposition, which had appeared rudderless and largely ineffectual since a wave of protests in 2017 was crushed by the security forces.\\r\\nMr. Guaid\u00f3 and other opposition leaders have convened town hall-style meetings across Venezuela in an effort to build broad support for their vision of a transitional government. Those meetings, known as cabildos, have been attended by thousands of people. Some have been held in poor districts that have traditionally been bedrocks of support for Mr. Maduro\u2019s political party.\\r\\nMr. Guaid\u00f3 has called for nationwide demonstrations on Wednesday, which opposition leaders hope will show that their bid to replace Mr. Maduro has widespread support. The armed forces\u2019 backing is key to the effort, Juan Andr\u00e9s Mej\u00eda, an opposition lawmaker who has addressed some of the recent town hall meetings.\\r\\n\u201cWe need to appeal to their conscience and create incentives for them,\u201d he said.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1305399972,\"description\":\"The rebellion came days after opposition leaders offered amnesty to armed forces members who throw their support behind a transitional government.\\r\",\"title\":\"Venezuela Detains National Guard Members Accused of Turning on Maduro\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"world.21.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Welcome to In Her Words, where women rule the headlines.

But march.\u201d \u2014 Gloria Steinem, responding to news that there would be competing women\u2019s marches in New York City\\r\\nDays after the 2016 election, a small group of women \u2014 alarmed by the impending Trump presidency \u2014 got together at a New York restaurant to plan a demonstration. What resulted from that meeting, and many others like it, was the largest single-day protest in United States history, the Women\u2019s March, which took place in about 600 American cities and towns and on every continent in the world. \\r\\nIt was an event that served as a catalyst for political change, helping to inspire a record number of women to run for office.\\r\\nNo social justice movement is without conflict, and disagreements around the Women\u2019s March were there from the start: Should the march include anti-abortion women? Were the needs and priorities of women of color overshadowed by the priorities of white women? What about transgender women? \\r\\nOn the eve of the third annual Women\u2019s March, which will take place Saturday, charges of infighting and anti-Semitism are hanging over the event. At least one march has been canceled, in California; and in New York, two competing marches are taking place, their leaders at odds. \\r\\nMeanwhile, the national group has released its 2019 platform \u2014 at its core: influencing federal policy \u2014 and tens of thousands of demonstrators are expected.\\r\\nWhether or not you\u2019re planning to march on Saturday, here\u2019s a breakdown of what\u2019s been happening, and what to expect.\\r\\n[Listen to The Daily: A Rift Over Power and Privilege in the Women\u2019s March]\\r\\nCharges of anti-Semitism \\r\\nRecent articles in Tablet, a Jewish magazine, and The New York Times have renewed scrutiny of claims that some of the earliest founders of the Women\u2019s March had made anti-Semitic remarks.\\r\\nIn both articles, Vanessa Wruble, a Brooklyn-based activist and an early leader of the Women\u2019s March, says her Jewish heritage played a role in her being pushed out of the group \u2014 charges that Tamika Mallory and Bob Bland, presidents of the national Women\u2019s March, have vehemently denied.\\r\\nMallory has also been criticized for expressing support for Louis Farrakhan, who has been widely condemned for making anti-Semitic, as well as transphobic and sexist remarks. (Mallory has said she disagrees with some of Farrakhan\u2019s statements.)\\r\\nLinda Sarsour, another one of the march\u2019s co-chairs, has expressed solidarity with Palestinians under Israeli occupation. On the allegation that the group did not address concerns of anti-Semitism fast enough, she said: \u201cGive us a chance.\u201d\\r\\n[READ MORE: Women\u2019s March Roiled by Accusations of anti-Semitism]\\r\\nCalls for a leadership change\\r\\nIn recent weeks, Jewish groups and Teresa Shook \u2014 the first person to suggest the idea of a women\u2019s march in a 2016 Facebook post \u2014 have called for the resignations of the leaders of the national movement: Mallory, Bland, Sarsour and Carmen Perez.\\r\\nRegional chapters of the Women\u2019s March, civil rights groups and high-profile allies \u2014 including the Democratic Party, which until recently was listed as a supporter on the Women\u2019s March website \u2014 have distanced themselves from the national entity. On Thursday, Women\u2019s March Global, a group that organizes marches around the world, sent out an email underscoring that it had never been affiliated with the national Women\u2019s March.\\r\\nEven the name \u201cWomen\u2019s March\u201d is causing conflict, with four organizations suing the national Women\u2019s March organization over its efforts to trademark it.\\r\\n\u201cIt was never meant to belong to one group,\u201d Wruble said. \u201cIt was a movement.

The market sure hopes so\\r\\nA report from the WSJ on Thursday said that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had suggested ending some or all tariffs against China, lifting global stocks even after his agency stressed that trade talks were far from complete.\\r\\nMr. Mnuchin said that easing the penalties would encourage China to make longer-term concessions while calming jittery markets, according to the report, which cited anonymous sources.\\r\\nThe Treasury Department later said that officials had made no recommendations on tariffs.\\r\\nChina\u2019s trade czar, Liu He, is scheduled to participate in negotiations in Washington on Jan. 30.

It has placed last at the domestic box office for seven years running. It shed its lucrative TV business years ago. And the Paramount lot is long overdue for improvements.\\r\\nThe competition: The old-line film business is going to become tougher as streaming services proliferate. Netflix will pump out about 90 movies this year. Apple intends to roll out its multibillion-dollar TV and movie offering, and Facebook has become serious about its Watch video-on-demand platform.\\r\\nThe solution: Paramount restarted television production in 2013 and now has nine series running, including \u201cJack Ryan\u201d on Amazon Prime.

The study, which was published this month in Nature Medicine, involved mice, but its findings could help to explain how, at a molecular level, exercise protects our brains and possibly preserves memory and thinking skills, even in people whose pasts are fading.\\r\\nConsiderable scientific evidence already demonstrates that exercise remodels brains and affects thinking. Researchers have shown in rats and mice that running ramps up the creation of new brain cells in the hippocampus, a portion of the brain devoted to memory formation and storage. Exercise also can improve the health and function of the synapses between neurons there, allowing brain cells to better communicate.\\r\\nIn people, epidemiological research indicates that being physically active reduces the risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other dementias and may also slow disease progression.\\r\\nBut many questions remain about just how exercise alters the inner workings of the brain and whether the effects are a result of changes elsewhere in the body that also happen to be good for the brain or whether the changes actually occur within the brain itself.\\r\\nThose issues attracted the attention of an international consortium of scientists \u2014 some of them neuroscientists, others cell biologists \u2014 all of whom were focused on preventing, treating and understanding Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\\r\\nThose concerns had brought a hormone called irisin into their sphere of interest. Irisin, first identified in 2012 and named for Iris, the gods\u2019 messenger in Greek mythology, is produced by muscles during exercise. The hormone jump-starts multiple biochemical reactions throughout the body, most of them related to energy metabolism.\\r\\n[Read more about irisin. | Sign up for the Well newsletter.]\\r\\nBecause Alzheimer\u2019s disease is believed to involve, in part, changes in how brain cells use energy, the scientists reasoned that exercise might be helping to protect brains by increasing levels of irisin there.\\r\\nBut if so, they realized, irisin would have to exist in human brains. To see if it did, they gathered tissues from brain banks and, using sophisticated testing, found irisin there. Gene expression patterns in those tissues also suggested that much of this irisin had been created in the brain itself. Levels of the hormone were especially high in the brains of people who were free of dementia when they died, but were barely detectable in the brains of people who had died with Alzheimer\u2019s.\\r\\nThose tests, however, though interesting, could not tell scientists what role irisin might be playing in brains. So the researchers now turned to mice, some healthy and others bred to develop a rodent form of Alzheimer\u2019s.\\r\\nThey infused the brains of the animals bred to have dementia with a concentrated dose of irisin. Those mice soon began to perform better on memory tests and show signs of improved synaptic health.\\r\\nAt the same time, they soaked the brains of the healthy animals with a substance that inhibits production of irisin and then pumped in a form of beta amyloid, a protein that clumps together to form plaques in the brains of those with Alzheimer\u2019s. In effect, they gave the mice dementia. And, without any irisin in their brains, the once-healthy mice soon showed signs of worsening memory and poor function in the synapses between neurons in their hippocampus.\\r\\nThe scientists also looked inside individual neurons from healthy mice and found that, when they added irisin to the cells, gene expression changed in ways that would be expected to lessen damage from beta amyloid.\\r\\nFinally and perhaps most important, the scientists had healthy mice work out, swimming for an hour almost every day for five weeks. Beforehand, some of the animals also were treated with the substance that blocks irisin production.\\r\\nIn the untreated animals, irisin levels in the brain blossomed during the exercise training and later, after the animals\u2019 brains were exposed to beta amyloid, they seemed to fight off its effects, performing significantly better on memory tests than sedentary control mice that likewise had been exposed.\\r\\nBut the animals that had been unable to create irisin did not benefit much from exercise. After exposure to beta amyloid, they performed about as poorly on memory tests as sedentary animals with beta amyloid in their brains.\\r\\nTaken as a whole, these experiments suggest that exercise may protect against dementia in part by triggering an increase in the amount of irisin in the brain, says Ottavio Arancio, a professor of pathology and cell biology at Columbia University, who conducted the research along with two dozen colleagues from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, Queen\u2019s University in Canada and other institutions.\\r\\nBut the experiments, although elaborate and multipronged, used mice, and so cannot tell us if exercise and irisin will work similarly in people, or how much and what types of exercise might be best for brain health. The results also do not show whether exercise and irisin can prevent Alzheimer\u2019s, but only that they seem to allay some of the effects of the disease in mice once it begins.\\r\\nThe scientists involved in the study hope soon to test a pharmaceutical form of irisin as a treatment for dementia in animals and eventually people, especially those who have lost the ability to exercise, Dr. Arancio says.\\r\\nBut for now, he says, the overarching lesson of the study would seem to be that \u201cif you can, go for a walk.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1269534550,\"description\":\"Irisin, a hormone that is released during exercise, may improve brain health and lessen the damage that occurs during Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\\r\",\"title\":\"Phys Ed: How Exercise May Help Keep Our Memory Sharp\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"health.29.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Jean Bourgain, a mathematician who conquered difficult problems prolifically across a wide swath of fields, died on Dec. 22 at a hospital in Bonheiden, Belgium. He was 64.\\r\\nThe Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., where Dr. Bourgain was a professor, said the cause was pancreatic cancer.\\r\\nDr. Bourgain\u2019s honors included a Fields Medal in 1994, perhaps the most prestigious prize in mathematics, and the 2017 Breakthrough Prize, which was accompanied by $3 million. That prize, whose sponsors include Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, and Sergey Brin, a founder of Google, attempts to bring popular attention to researchers at the cutting edge of science and mathematics.\\r\\nDr. Bourgain wrote or co-wrote more than 500 papers, far more than most professional mathematicians.\\r\\n\u201cHe was a problem solver unequaled,\u201d Peter C. Sarnak, a colleague of Dr. Bourgain\u2019s at the institute, said in an interview.\\r\\nDr. Sarnak said that Bourgain started out in an esoteric corner of mathematics with extremely difficult problems. \u201cHe just came in and started solving one problem after the other in that subject,\u201d he said. \u201cSo he made his name there, became very famous, winning all sorts of young-up-and-coming-star prizes. But then he broadened out.\u201d\\r\\nDr. Bourgain found that tools he had developed could also be applied to other fields of mathematics, including partial differential equations, computer science, quantum mechanics and dynamical systems, making progress on formidable problems that had stymied experts in those areas.\\r\\n\u201cThere would be some big mountain in front of you,\u201d Dr. Sarnak said, \u201cand he would ascend halfway up, occasionally all the way up. People couldn\u2019t understand how he got all the way up. It would take often months or years for people to understand his proofs. He liked the idea that he was way ahead and people were catching up to him all the time. He would open these doors.\u201d\\r\\nSome of Dr. Bourgain\u2019s recent work included a \u201cdecoupling theorem\u201d \u2014 a very abstract generalization of the Pythagorean theorem applied to oscillating waves, like light or radio waves. While Pythagoras merely showed how the length of the two shorter sides of a right triangle are related to the longer hypotenuse, the decoupling theorem proved by Dr. Bourgain and Ciprian Demeter, of Indiana University, showed similar relationships in the superposition of waves, when the individual oscillations are added together.\\r\\nThe Belgian government bestowed the title of baron on Dr. Bourgain in 2015. He designed a coat of arms for himself with the inscription \u201cIn spem contra spem,\u201d or \u201cIn hope against hope.\u201d\\r\\nJean Bourgain was born on Feb. 28, 1954, in Ostende, Belgium. After receiving a doctorate from the Free University of Brussels in 1977, he became a professor at the university in 1981.\\r\\nIn 1985, he began splitting time between the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Scientifiques in Paris. He was also a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the California Institute of Technology before moving to the Institute for Advanced Study in 1994.\\r\\nDr. Bourgain worked in the area of mathematics known as analysis, which often studies inequalities, with the aim of trying to simplify problems instead of coming up with exact solutions. \u201cThe art of analysis is not to lose the important information,\u201d Vitali Milman, a mathematician at Tel-Aviv University in Israel, said in a phone interview.\\r\\nDr. Milman recalled that he and Dr. Bourgain were once discussing a math problem and Dr. Bourgain told him that he had always kept two problems in mind: \u201cOne which I want to solve and another which I can solve.\u201d\\r\\nWhen Dr. Bourgain was stuck on the problem he was working on, Dr. Milman said, he would work through the other one \u2014 which he knew how to work through \u2014 to reassure himself that he had not become \u201cimpotent in mathematics.\u201d\\r\\nWhat was amazing, Dr. Milman said, was that Dr. Bourgain could intuit that a problem was solvable: \u201cHe was ready to do it, before he actually knew how to do it.\u201d\\r\\nDr. Bourgain was less comfortable in the classroom. While teaching a course at Illinois, he once asked Dr. Milman to join him on campus to provide emotional support. Before a lecture Dr. Bourgain was to give, Dr. Milman noticed him looking at a piece of paper. Dr. Milman asked if he was doing last-minute preparations. No, Dr. Bourgain replied; he was calculating what he would earn for holding the class.\\r\\n\u201cWhen I see the number,\u201d he told Dr. Milman, \u201cI feel at ease going to the lecture.\u201d\\r\\nDr. Bourgain\u2019s cancer was diagnosed in late 2014, but he continued his math research.\\r\\nLarry Guth, a mathematician at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, recalled coming across the decoupling theorem by Dr. Bourgain and Dr. Demeter. Their proof went against the expectations of people in the field. \u201cThat made me very curious about it,\u201d Dr. Guth said in an interview.\\r\\nBut Dr. Guth was hesitant to contact Dr. Bourgain, who had undergone cancer surgery a few months earlier. Then he checked an online archive of mathematics papers and found that Dr. Bourgain had posted several new papers since his operation.\\r\\nDr. Guth wrote to Dr. Bourgain and Dr. Demeter, and they began discussing how to extend the work. A couple of weeks later, Dr. Guth was visiting Princeton and went to visit Dr. Bourgain, who then explained how to solve the problem they had been discussing. \u201cIt filled 10 blackboards,\u201d Dr. Guth said.\\r\\nThe resulting paper used the superposition of waves to settle a question about integers \u2014 a problem that had been intractable for more than 80 years.\\r\\nDr. Bourgain is survived by his wife, Mei-Chu Chang; a son, Eric; and a sister, Claire Bourgain.\\r\\nA year ago, the American Mathematical Society honored Dr. Bourgain with its Steele Prize for lifetime achievement, but he was not done.\\r\\nIn November, he was finishing a few final projects.

Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter\\r\\nAaron Davis, a British botanist, has spent 30 years trekking across forests and farms to chronicle the fate of one plant: coffee.\\r\\nHe has recorded how a warming planet is making it harder to grow coffee in traditional coffee-producing regions, including Ethiopia, the birthplace of the world\u2019s most popular bean, arabica. He has mapped where farmers can grow coffee next: basically upcountry, where it\u2019s cooler. He has gone searching for rare varieties in the wild.\\r\\nNow, in what is perhaps his most disheartening research, Dr. Davis has found that wild coffee, the dozens of varieties that once occurred under forest canopies on at least three continents, is at risk of vanishing forever. Among the world\u2019s 124 coffee species, he and a team of scientists have concluded, 60 percent are at risk of extinction in the wild. Climate change and deforestation are to blame.\\r\\nIt matters because those wild varieties could be crucial for coffee\u2019s survival in the era of global warming. In those plants could lie the genes that scientists need to develop new varieties that can grow on a hotter, drier planet. \\r\\nUltimately, Dr. Davis said, those wild coffees are vital for the millions of farmers who make a living from coffee, not to mention the many more who rely on caffeine to start their days. (Dr. Davis limits it to \u201cone cup of really good coffee\u201d a day.)\\r\\n\u201cThere are a broad range of traits, which have good potential for addressing specific issues in the future, whether its drought tolerance or disease resistance,\u201d Dr. Davis said by phone from the Royal Botanic Gardens in the London suburb of Kew, where he is a senior researcher. \u201cAs we lose those coffees, our options diminish.\u201d\\r\\nDr. Davis and his co-authors published their findings Wednesday in two separate papers, in Science Advances and Global Change Biology.\\r\\nOf the 124 known wild species, most are not cultivated or consumed. Two exceptions are arabica, which has been farmed for hundreds of years in East Africa, and robusta, which has gone from the wild to one of the world\u2019s most important commodities in the past 100 years. Coffee farmers already face mounting pressure from drought, disease and the vagaries of commodities prices. Addressing those risks requires tapping into the genetic riches of wild varieties.\\r\\nWild coffees can be preserved in seed banks or in nationally protected forests. Most are not. Dr. Davis\u2019 inventory found that nearly half of all wild coffee species are not held in seed banks, and a third do not grow in national forests.\\r\\nA 2018 report by the Crop Trust, which runs a global seed bank, also warned of the need to preserve the genetic diversity of coffee, including its wild varieties. Only a handful of gene banks hold coffee trees, the report found, and many of them are hampered by either aging specimens or a lack of adequate funding.\\r\\nTo assess the risks faced by wild coffees, Dr. Davis and his colleagues applied a barometer developed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, an international organization that assesses biodiversity risks. Using that index, commonly used to document risks to big mammals like elephants and rhinos, they found wild arabica, which mainly grows in the forests of Ethiopia, to be particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change.\\r\\n If greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise at their current pace, changing climate conditions could move wild arabica from the conservation union\u2019s \u201cnear threatened\u201d category to \u201cextinct\u201d by the end of the century. \\r\\nFor Dr. Davis, the loss of wild varieties is important not just for plant breeders, farmers and coffee drinkers. The loss of a species also means less food and less shelter in its ecosystem. The result, in his view, is a diminished Earth. \u201cOur planet becomes less diverse, less interesting,\u201d he said.\\r\\nHis most recent expedition took him to Sierra Leone in December. He and his colleagues went searching for what they had feared was a lost coffee species, the slow-growing stenophylla, which hadn\u2019t been seen on a plantation in more than 60 years.\\r\\nOn that land, the team found one plant \u2014 insufficient to propagate. So they kept walking. Across the border in Liberia, after a six-hour trek, they arrived at a hillside covered with stenophylla. It is now being tested in Sierra Leone. \\r\\nFor more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1903783804,\"description\":\"Researchers found that more than half of all species could vanish from the wild, and the implications for coffee\u2019s survival in the era of climate change are huge.\\r\",\"title\":\"Global Warming Is Helping to Wipe Out Coffee in the Wild\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.31.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"TURNERS FALLS, Mass. \u2014 It seemed like the perfect setting for a shy, thoughtful 10-year-old boy\u2019s first steps on stage: a kids\u2019 Shakespeare program that doesn\u2019t hold auditions, guarantees everyone a substantial speaking role, emphasizes community, and excludes no one.\\r\\nUnless, as Mason Wicks-Lim and his mother Ali discovered, you have a life-threatening nut allergy.\\r\\nThe conflict that ensued over how the theater could accommodate Mason\u2019s allergy eventually grew into a legal battle that created a rift in the community, highlighting the social struggles that people with food allergies often contend with, even as they fight for equal access.\\r\\nThe turmoil began when the family tried to enroll Mason, now 14, in Young Shakespeare Players-East, a revered institution in this small historic town that takes pride in its arts community and progressive activism. The theater\u2019s director, Suzanne Rubinstein, at first rebuffed efforts to register Mason, citing concerns that no one on staff could be trained to administer an EpiPen, a shot of epinephrine used to treat severe allergic reactions. Then, following months of negotiations, she threatened to close the program if he joined.\\r\\nAs word got around that Mason was not welcome, some of his peers in the program urged Ms. Rubinstein to reconsider. Sam Picone-Louro, who was then 12 and had played a soldier and a senator in the spring production of \u201cJulius Caesar,\u201d accused Ms. Rubinstein of discrimination.\\r\\n\u201cYou said yourself there are no rejections and you are rejecting Mason,\u201d Sam wrote in an email.\\r\\nMs. Rubinstein told Sam to apologize or find a different acting program, and then emailed other families warning them that she would brook no criticism. The program, Ms. Rubinstein said, \u201cis not for everyone.\u201d Sam did not apologize and was not allowed to continue in the program.\\r\\nOn Dec. 31, the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination concluded that Sam was right. The Shakespeare group may have not only illegally discriminated against Mason, the commission said, but also retaliated against Sam for speaking up. Two years earlier, in June 2016, the United States Department of Justice had reached a similar conclusion, saying that the theater violated the Americans With Disabilities Act by failing to make reasonable modifications to accommodate Mason.\\r\\nThe Massachusetts commission has ordered the Shakespeare group to settle with the families by Feb. 5 or face a public hearing and possible sanctions, said Mary Vargas, the lawyer who represents the two families.\\r\\nMs. Rubinstein did not agree to an interview, but YSP East\u2019s lawyer, Frank DiPrima, said that \u201cMason was always welcome to register.\u201d He said that Sam, who is transgender and uses the pronouns \u201cthey\u201d and \u201cthem,\u201d would have been welcomed back, had they been more respectful.\\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to try, for the benefit of children past and future, to conciliate,\u201d Mr. DiPrima said. \u201cNo other program of this size has done as much to accommodate children with disabilities.\u201d\\r\\nFor Mason and Sam, the legal victories are bittersweet. The repercussions of the ouster from the theater group, which included many of their friends, affected the families as well as the children. Friendships frayed, and some ties were severed.\\r\\nMany children with food allergies experience exclusion and discrimination, which \u201ccan be more detrimental than the allergy,\u201d said Dr. James Baker Jr., a professor of medicine and director of the Mary H. Weiser Food Allergy Center at the University of Michigan.\\r\\n\u201cWe hear this all the time, where people isolate kids, tell them they can\u2019t go places, tell them they can\u2019t participate in after-school activities or that their parents have to be there if they\u2019re in a soccer game,\u201d Dr. Baker said. \u201cThe child starts to feel like he or she is the problem.\u201d\\r\\nThough legal claims are rare, the number is likely to grow, due in part to a 2008 amendment to the Americans With Disabilities Act that has made it easier for people with food allergies \u2014 who are perfectly healthy most of the time \u2014 to qualify as a protected class, Ms. Vargas said.\\r\\nIn Mason\u2019s case, his mother said she tried for six months to find a solution that would make it possible for Mason to join the Shakespeare group.\\r\\n\u201cMy approach to Mason has always been that \u2018you can do anything anyone can do, except eat nuts,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Wicks-Lim said. \u201cAnd before this happened, it had never occurred to him that he might not be welcome in a place.\u201d\\r\\nIn August 2015, Ms. Rubinstein emailed Ms. Wicks-Lim to say that she would have to be at the theater during rehearsals in case Mason needed an EpiPen injection. \\r\\nAfter a lawyer informed her that the law required accommodating a child with a disability like a food allergy, Ms. Rubinstein reversed herself and emailed Ms. Wicks-Lim that she was seriously considering \u201cwhether to close shop!\u201d\\r\\nA few weeks later, Ms. Rubinstein said that the theater would implement a peanut- and tree nut-free snack and lunch policy and that she and another adult staff member would learn to use an EpiPen. But the same email said that the children in the program \u2014 ages 8 to 18 \u2014 were often left without adult supervision \u201cfor hours at a time (full days).\u201d\\r\\nIn September, Ms. Wicks-Lim decided she could not safely enroll Mason. She let Mason make the call about whether to file a discrimination complaint.\\r\\nThe rift in the community intensified after the complaints were filed. The local newspaper printed letters from residents saying the YSP should not be getting negative press because \u201cof one or two disgruntled parents whose children have food allergies.\u201d YSP-East portrayed Ms. Wicks-Lim as a mother \u201cwho refused to accept responsibility for her son\u2019s medical condition.\u201d She was barred from a mommies list serve.\\r\\nSam became disillusioned when friends from the theater group \u2014 who had been \u201clike a second family\u201d \u2014 failed to stand up for Mason, and soon became alienated from their old community. \u201cSo much of who I am is about standing in your truth and standing up for people, and having your moral judgment shape your decisions,\u201d Sam said. \u201cBut everyone turned a blind eye.\u201d\\r\\nBoth children have pursued other interests.

Here\u2019s the latest: \\r\\n\\r\\nMay returns with Brexit Plan B\\r\\nPrime Minister Theresa May returned to Parliament with an alternative blueprint for Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the E.U.\\r\\nInfuriating some lawmakers, it looked a lot like her initial plan, which was voted down last week in one of the most resounding parliamentary defeats in British history.\\r\\nWhy it matters: The face-off could become another epic political showdown that leaves the Brexit process where it has been for months \u2014 stuck in limbo with no obvious path forward.\\r\\nGo deeper: The speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, has emerged as a surprise star of Brexit after he broke with precedent to wrest some control over the decision-making process.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGreenland\u2019s melting ice nears \u201ctipping point\u201d\\r\\nA new study warns that the ice sheet covering the massive island, which lies mainly above the Arctic Circle, is melting at such an accelerated rate that it may become \u201ca major contributor to sea level rise\u201d around the world within two decades.\\r\\nThe study\u2019s authors found that ice loss in 2012 was nearly four times the rate in 2003, adding to research showing that the melting is speeding up as the warming increases. Another study found that Greenland\u2019s ice loss had reached its fastest rate in at least 350 years.\\r\\nWhy it matters: The study is the latest in a series of papers published this month suggesting that scientific estimates of the effects of a warming planet have been, if anything, too conservative. Researchers say they collectively underline the need for a sharp reduction in emissions of planet-warming gases.\\r\\n\\r\\nU.S. government shutdown enters fifth week\\r\\nPresident Trump, faced with increasing backlash over the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, made an offer over the weekend: temporary protections for roughly 700,000 young undocumented immigrants, known as \u201cDreamers,\u201d in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a border wall.\\r\\nDemocrats called it \u201chostage taking\u201d and refused to negotiate until the government reopens.\\r\\nSome of the 800,000 furloughed federal employees are turning to pawnshops and brokers for short-term loans. Subsidies for low-income renters have stopped.\\r\\nGo deeper: People who have done business with Mr. Trump over the years say his uncompromising fixation on a southern border wall is consistent with the negotiating tactics he used for decades in the private sector, focused foremost on claiming victory.\\r\\nIn other U.S. news: In a rare public statement, the office of the special counsel running the Russia investigation disputed a BuzzFeed News report that Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, told prosecutors that the president had directed him to lie to Congress. \\r\\n\\r\\nSpartan refuges in the British countryside\\r\\nEngland, Wales and Scotland are dotted by more than 100 rustic shelters called bothies (the word rhymes with \u201cfrothy\u201d). Often little more than four walls, a roof, a stove and a stone floor \u2014 and no bathroom \u2014 they serve as remote way stations for a motley assortment of adventurers who take to Britain\u2019s spectacular and sometimes forbidding countryside. \\r\\nDetails: The bothies are free to use, and the vast majority are repurposed structures like shepherds\u2019 huts and mining outbuildings. They came into recreational use in the 1930s as weekend getaways, sometimes used clandestinely, for working-class laborers. \\r\\nFuture: Some longtime proponents of bothy culture fear that it is endangered by the internet, where map coordinates for the often hard-to-find dwellings can be obtained by all, rather than just by hiking insiders. But getting to bothies can be such a task \u2014 through cold, driving rain and bogs, and over trails that can be mere faint notions \u2014 that overcrowding may never become a problem. \\r\\nHere\u2019s what else is happening\\r\\nGoogle: The French authorities fined Google 50 million euros for not properly telling users how it collects data across its services, including its search engine, Google Maps and YouTube, to present personalized advertisements. It is the largest penalty to date under the E.U.\u2019s privacy law known as G.D.P.R. \\r\\nAfghanistan: Hours before the Taliban announced that they had resumed peace talks with American officials, they attacked a base in central Afghanistan run by the national intelligence agency, killing dozens of people.\\r\\nHidden painting: The opening of an Oscar de la Renta boutique in Paris is in flux because of a mysterious artwork more than three centuries old that resurfaced behind a wall.\\r\\nRussia: The Trump administration cast its move to lift sanctions on the business empire of the Russian oligarch Oleg V. Deripaska as tough on him and on Russia. But a confidential document shows that the deal frees him from hundreds of millions of dollars in debt.\\r\\nNorthern Ireland: The police arrested four men on Sunday over a car bombing in Londonderry the night before that drew condemnation from across the political spectrum. It caused no casualties or major damage.\\r\\nCarlos Ghosn: For the second time in a week, a Japanese court has rejected a bail request by the ousted Nissan chairman, who has spent more than two months in a Tokyo jail on charges of financial misconduct.\\r\\nKamala Harris: The California Democrat who became the second black woman to serve in the U.S. Senate declared her candidacy for president, joining an increasingly crowded and diverse field. (Here\u2019s our candidate tracker.)\\r\\nMeng Hongwei: Nearly four months after the Interpol president was detained in China on corruption charges, his wife, Grace Meng, applied for asylum in France. \u201cI cannot go back to China; such strange things happen there, and fundamental rights are not respected,\u201d Ms. Meng told a French newspaper.\\r\\nChina\u2019s economy: Official numbers show 6.6 percent growth in 2018, the slowest for the country since 1990. But many economists see more slowing than government figures show.\\r\\nVulgar question: The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal by a clothing line whose brand name, \u201cFuct,\u201d was rejected by the trademark office as the \u201cphonetic twin\u201d of the most versatile Anglo-Saxon curse word.\\r\\nHalal tourism: Muslims now make up one of the fastest-growing segments of the travel industry.

But for decades, low prize money and dates around the Christmas holidays kept many players above the Equator. Chris Evert played the Australian Open just six times; John McEnroe five; Bjorn Borg once.\\r\\nOver time, the prize money and ranking points increased, and the tournament shifted to the third and fourth weeks of January. In 1988, its home moved to the brand-new Melbourne Park. Today, the \u201cGrand Slam of Asia-Pacific\u201d lures business support and fans from across the region.\\r\\nAnd now the stars line up.

The vast majority of American small businesses are organized as pass-throughs, whose profits are divided up among owners and taxed as individual income. Many financial firms and real estate companies \u2014 including hundreds that are under the umbrella of the Trump Organization \u2014 are also set up as pass-throughs.\\r\\nThe regulation includes several changes from a proposal the Treasury Department issued in August. It now allows certain mutual-fund holders to benefit from the deduction if they have holdings in a real estate trust. It also provides far greater detail on the type of service businesses that are excluded from claiming the deduction above a certain income threshold. The law\u2019s drafters have said that limitation was meant to prevent certain high-earning individuals, such as lawyers, from reclassifying individual income as pass-through income, in order to reduce their tax bills.\\r\\nSome of those details appear likely to disappoint business leaders who urged Treasury to broaden the definition of what sorts of companies qualify for the full deduction. Major League Baseball owners, for example, had pushed to be eligible after the draft regulations excluded them.\\r\\n\u201cSports clubs are engaged in a multifaceted business that involves activities and operations relating to selling media rights, tickets, concessions, signage rights, sponsorships, merchandise and other goods, managing real estate, and creating entertainment content,\u201d the M.L.B. commissioner, Robert D. Manfred Jr., wrote in a comment on the proposed regulations. \u201cThis is in stark contrast to accounting firms, law firms, consulting firms, investment banking firms, and health care practices, whose sole and narrow business is to engage in the performance of professional services for their customers.\u201d\\r\\nThe final regulations still exclude them.\\r\\nThe nation\u2019s largest small-business advocacy group, the National Federation of Independent Business, welcomed the regulation. It provides \u201cneeded certainty to small business owners,\u201d said Brad Close, senior vice president of public policy and advocacy. \u201cThe vast majority of small businesses will enjoy the benefits of the full 20 percent deduction.\u201d\\r\\nA companion regulation issued on Friday would allow owners of rental properties to claim the deduction provided they keep certain records and perform 250 hours a year of \u201crental services\u201d on the property \u2014 either by themselves or by hiring someone to do it. Those guidelines would appear to allow some Americans who rent rooms or other property through sites such as Airbnb to qualify for the full deduction, though not if they live in the property at any time during the year.\\r\\nThe guidelines also exclude some of the largest landlords in the country, because they rent to tenants using so-called triple-net leases that call for tenants to pay all real estate taxes, maintenance and building insurance. \u201cI am very surprised they did what they did,\u201d said Anthony J. Nitti, a tax partner at Withum in Aspen, Colo., who has written extensively on pass-through regulations. \u201cIt creates this strange dichotomy.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Nitti said winners under the new regulations include assisted living facilities and employment staffing companies, which appear now to qualify for the full deduction without limitations. Losers include radiologists and possibly chiropractors, who appear not to qualify, he said.\\r\\nNicole Kaeding, director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation in Washington, said the regulations would likely lead to lawsuits that force courts to determine whether many individual businesses qualify.\\r\\n\u201cIt is a generous deduction that encourages individuals to try and take advantage,\u201d she said. \u201cThe I.R.S. regulations could be perfect and still, the beneficial tax treatment will ensure that accountants and attorneys will seek to innovative on new business structures and forms to maximize the deduction.\u201d\\r\\nTreasury is one of the agencies where funding has lapsed during the government shutdown, meaning its employees are either furloughed or working without pay.

Want this by email? Sign up here.\\r\\nA thaw in trade talks with China? The market sure hopes so\\r\\nA report from the WSJ on Thursday said that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had suggested ending some or all tariffs against China, lifting global stocks even after his agency stressed that trade talks were far from complete.\\r\\nMr. Mnuchin said that easing the penalties would encourage China to make longer-term concessions while calming jittery markets, according to the report, which cited anonymous sources.\\r\\nThe Treasury Department later said that officials had made no recommendations on tariffs.\\r\\nChina\u2019s trade czar, Liu He, is scheduled to participate in negotiations in Washington on Jan. 30. After March 1, tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to grow to 25 percent from 10 percent.\\r\\nIn other China news:\\r\\n\u2022 China\u2019s ambassador to Canada warned of \u201crepercussions\u201d if the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei were blocked from Canada\u2019s 5G network. Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested last month in Vancouver, British Columbia, and the company has also faced resistance and suspicion from Germany, the U.S. and other Western countries.\\r\\n\u2022 Foreign investors such as Blackstone Group spent a record $9 billion on commercial real estate in China last year.\\r\\n\u2022 Chinese tech companies, stressed by trade tensions, stricter policing of online content and a slowing domestic economy, cut hiring ads 20 percent in the last quarter of 2018.\\r\\n____________________________\\r\\nToday\u2019s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.\\r\\n____________________________\\r\\n\\r\\nParamount, lurching toward irrelevancy, hopes for a turnaround\\r\\nAfter decades of mismanagement, Paramount Pictures, the once-vaunted studio behind classic films like \u201cThe Godfather\u201d and \u201cChinatown,\u201d is fighting for its existence, write Amy Chozick and Brooks Barnes.\\r\\nThe challenge: The studio racked up nearly $900 million in losses in the last two years. It has placed last at the domestic box office for seven years running. It shed its lucrative TV business years ago. And the Paramount lot is long overdue for improvements.\\r\\nThe competition: The old-line film business is going to become tougher as streaming services proliferate. Netflix will pump out about 90 movies this year. Apple intends to roll out its multibillion-dollar TV and movie offering, and Facebook has become serious about its Watch video-on-demand platform.\\r\\nThe solution: Paramount restarted television production in 2013 and now has nine series running, including \u201cJack Ryan\u201d on Amazon Prime. It hired one of Hollywood\u2019s top producers, Wyck Godfrey, as president of the film division. And it hopes to make 17 movies in 2020, with a focus on big budgets and global audiences.\\r\\nPlayground brawls on Capitol Hill\\r\\nOn the 28th day of the government shutdown, Washington feels like \u201can unruly sandbox,\u201d where \u201cseptuagenarian politicians are squabbling like 7-year-olds,\u201d writes Mark Landler.\\r\\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi, who had pressed President Trump to postpone his State of the Union address, received his sarcasm-laced response on Thursday.\\r\\nWithout mentioning the speech, the president said he was canceling a secret trip for Ms. Pelosi and other members of Congress to meet with NATO officials in Brussels and visit American troops in Afghanistan. She was expected to depart Thursday on a military aircraft; Mr. Trump said she could fly commercial, \u201cobviously.\u201d\\r\\nSenator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, was not amused. He said in a statement:\\r\\n\u201cOne sophomoric response does not deserve another.\u201d\\r\\nPresident Trump also canceled a U.S. delegation set to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. But Melania Trump, the first lady, kept her plans to fly on a military jet to the family\u2019s Mar-a-Lago compound in Florida.\\r\\nThe stalemate over Homeland Security spending has grown increasingly bitter. Democrats suggested they would introduce their own proposals for protecting the country\u2019s borders.\\r\\nMeanwhile, tens of thousands of federal employees have sought unemployment benefits, with more filing claims every week.\\r\\nPG&E bankruptcy could hurt its solar-power suppliers\\r\\nPacific Gas and Electric promised that its customers\u2019 lights would stay on if it followed through on plans to file for bankruptcy this month. But a filing could be wrenching for power producers, especially those in renewable resources, write Ivan Penn and Peter Eavis.\\r\\nPG&E said that it would use bankruptcy protection to resolve huge liabilities arising from deadly wildfires in California. Such a move would allow it to walk away from older contracts with suppliers, particularly those with developers of renewable energy that were negotiated when solar panel prices were higher.\\r\\nCredit Suisse analysts estimate that PG&E could save $2.2 billion a year by renegotiating renewable power contracts down to current market prices.\\r\\nMore news: The prospective bankruptcy has exposed the risks of green-power investments: If the utility can renegotiate high-cost contracts, other companies will do the same. Fitch Ratings said the planned bankruptcy would not damage California\u2019s credit rating.\\r\\n\\r\\nRihanna: pop star, actress, entrepreneur \u2026 luxury fashion brand?\\r\\nShe was named fashion icon of the year by the Council of Fashion Designers of America in 2014. She became Dior\u2019s first black brand ambassador in 2015. Her Fenty Beauty cosmetics line is intensely popular; her Fenty x Savage lingerie collection debuted to great acclaim at New York Fashion Week.\\r\\nIt looks like LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the parent company of Dior, Givenchy and Fendi, could do worse than partnering with Robyn Rihanna Fenty.\\r\\nThe luxury conglomerate is working on a deal that would make Rihanna its first female designer of color. The partnership would build a brand from scratch in a way the company hasn\u2019t tried since starting the Christian Lacroix label in 1987, according to anonymous sources.\\r\\nThe deal would be \u201ca turning point in both fashion and fame,\u201d writes Vanessa Friedman, who calls it:\\r\\n\u201cThe clearest expression yet of how celebrity, social media and influencers have redefined the power balance between culture and consumption, changing the way brands of all kinds relate to their audience.\u201d\\r\\nWall Street is nervous about luxury spending, however, as stock market declines in recent months could compel consumers to scale back purchases, according to an analysis from Goldman Sachs.\\r\\nRevolving door\\r\\nNews Corporation said that Jesse Angelo was stepping down as publisher and chief executive at The New York Post.

Last month, more than a dozen students at Peking University in Beijing protested after the university blocked them from organizing a celebration for Mao\u2019s birthday and forced them out of a Marxist student group.\\r\\nHuman rights advocates warned that the taped confessions were an escalation and might indicate that the authorities are preparing to bring criminal charges.\\r\\nThe government often uses forced confessions by journalists, lawyers and activists for propaganda purposes, even before any formal legal proceedings have begun.\\r\\n\u201cCriminal prosecutions in China highly depend on confessions, often extracted through threats, mistreatment and torture,\u201d said Yaqiu Wang, a China researcher at Human Rights Watch in New York.\\r\\nThe videos focus on four activists \u2014 Yue Xin, Shen Mengyu, Gu Jiayue and Zheng Yongming \u2014 who were detained in August while helping workers at a welding manufacturer in southern China organize an independent labor union.\\r\\nIn the videos, which total about a half-hour, the activists, all in their 20s, confess to a variety of offenses, including subverting state power and working with foreign forces to hurt China\u2019s international image, activists said in interviews on Monday.

Renault, the third automaker in the global car alliance that Mr. Ghosn ran, is also  preparing to cut ties with its star executive.\\r\\nMr. Ghosn has been detained in Tokyo since Nov. 19 on suspicion of understating his salary for eight years, and of temporarily transferring personal investment losses to Nissan\u2019s books during the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. Ghosn has denied all charges. His lawyers could not immediately be reached for comment.\\r\\nMitsubishi\u2019s findings involve a joint venture between Nissan and Mitsubishi established in 2017 in the Netherlands. The company said Mr. Ghosn, who is listed as a director of the joint venture, had drawn up an employment contract that rewarded him \u20ac7.8 million in compensation.\\r\\nThe joint venture had been set up to distribute part of the savings generated by Nissan\u2019s 2017 acquisition of Mitsubishi to the departments at the automakers that generated the savings, a kind of incentive scheme to bring the companies closer together.\\r\\nThe joint venture\u2019s other directors \u2014 Mr. Masuko and Nissan\u2019s chief executive, Hiroto Saikawa \u2014 were unpaid and kept in the dark about Mr. Ghosn\u2019s compensation, according to Mitsubishi.

The joint venture was an unincorporated subsidiary of Mitsubishi and Nissan registered in the Netherlands, meaning it is likely to be beyond the purview of Japanese financial regulators.\\r\\nMitsubishi\u2019s allegations are the latest twist in a fall from grace for Mr. Ghosn, an industry titan.

Mr. Musk said in a companywide email that he wanted the lowest-priced Model 3 to sell for $35,000.\\r\\nTo do so, Mr. Musk said in the email, Tesla must improve the car\u2019s design, increase production and shed thousands of workers. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any other way,\u201d he wrote.\\r\\nTesla shares closed down 13 percent after the announcement.\\r\\nThe cuts, which could put more than 3,000 people out of work, follow a 9 percent reduction in Tesla\u2019s staff in June. Another of Mr. Musk\u2019s companies, the privately held rocket maker SpaceX, said this month that it would shrink its work force by about 10 percent.\\r\\nGiven the continuing uncertainty in global financial markets and signs that consumers are spending less, trimming costs to focus on affordability is \u201ca prudent thing to do\u201d for a company that started out selling cars with an average price close to $100,000, said Romit Shah, a research analyst at Nomura Instinet.\\r\\nIn October, Tesla reported that the third quarter of 2018 had yielded its first quarterly profit in two years, and its largest ever, thanks to cost-cutting moves, delayed payments to suppliers and a surge in production and sales.\\r\\nMr. Musk said in his email on Friday that, based on preliminary, unaudited results, the company expected to earn a smaller profit in the fourth quarter.\\r\\n\u201cThis quarter will hopefully allow us, with great difficulty, effort and some luck, to target a tiny profit,\u201d he wrote in his email on Friday.\\r\\nIn the third quarter, Mr. Shah said, Tesla \u201cneeded to get to profitability to survive, and they wouldn\u2019t have gotten there if they were selling a $35,000 car.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cThey would have lost money on every car they sold,\u201d he added, echoing a sentiment expressed by Mr. Musk last spring.\\r\\nTo meet its production and profit targets, Tesla focused on selling more upscale models of the Model 3 to a core group of Tesla enthusiasts willing to pay the higher prices.\\r\\n\u201cBut there\u2019s only a finite number of potential customers willing spend over $50,000 on a Model 3,\u201d Mr. Shah said. \u201cIf Tesla wants to see a pathway to a million cars sold a year, they\u2019re going to have to bring down that price point.\u201d\\r\\nTo succeed, the company will need to extend its appeal to a wider audience. Mr. Musk said Friday that Tesla must begin to deliver its midrange Model 3 in all markets by around May while making progress toward producing the $35,000 version he envisions.\\r\\n\u201cHead count reduction is part of the process,\u201d Philippe Houchois, an analyst at Jefferies, said in a note to clients.\\r\\nTesla has already lowered prices for all of its vehicles this month by $2,000 as a federal tax credit for buyers of electric cars that was worth $7,500 last year begins to be phased out.\\r\\n\u201cWhile we have made great progress, our products are still too expensive for most people,\u201d Mr. Musk wrote.

But economic activity is slowing in China, and many consumers there are cutting back on spending.\\r\\nThe car market in the United States is also showing signs of strain, with sales flattening last year.\\r\\nTesla is also contending with a challenge from traditional automakers like Ford, General Motors and Nissan, which are pushing harder into the electric-vehicle market. Audi, Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz and others have also introduced or plan to produce electric models that in many cases are less expensive than Tesla\u2019s.\\r\\nAs Tesla struggled last year to cope with a Model 3 production and delivery process that Mr. Musk has described as \u201chell,\u201d his behavior created distractions for the company.\\r\\nIn August, he wrote in a short, cryptic post on Twitter that he was considering taking Tesla private and had \u201cfunding secured,\u201d surprising board members and driving up the stock price.\\r\\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission later sued Mr. Musk in federal court, saying he had misled investors.

Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, then asked Mr. Wheeler, a former coal-industry lobbyist, to rate his level of concern on a scale of one to 10. \\r\\nAfter a pause, Mr. Wheeler said, \u201cabout eight or nine.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cReally?\u201d Mr. Merkley responded.\\r\\nSenator Merkley and other Democrats on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works took pains to focus in on Mr. Wheeler\u2019s efforts to roll back environmental protections and undo Obama-era regulations designed to fight climate change as indicators that he is unsuitable to lead the E.P.A.\\r\\nPresident Trump formally nominated Mr. Wheeler last week to lead the agency but he has been on the job in an acting capacity since his predecessor, Scott Pruitt, resigned in July amid ethics scandals. If Mr. Wheeler is confirmed, a strong likelihood with Republicans holding a 53-to-47 majority in the Senate, he will formally become one of the top soldiers in Mr. Trump\u2019s battle to undo regulations.\\r\\n\u201cThere is no more important responsibility than protecting human health and the environment,\u201d Mr. Wheeler told lawmakers. \u201cIt is a responsibility I take very seriously.\u201d At the same time, he said, the E.P.A. under his leadership has pushed forward with Mr. Trump\u2019s  agenda of deregulation.\\r\\n\u201cThrough our deregulatory actions, the Trump Administration has proven that burdensome federal regulations are not necessary to drive environmental progress,\u201d he said.\\r\\nSince July, Mr. Wheeler has replaced of a broad plan to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants, known as the Clean Power Plan, with weaker rules. He has proposed to relax federal protections for streams and wetlands, ease controls of mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants, and eliminate restrictions on new coal plants, a move that would make it easier to bring more coal power online.\\r\\nUnder Mr. Wheeler\u2019s leadership the E.P.A. also has proposed reversing Mr. Obama\u2019s clean car standards, one of the most important federal government tools for reducing planet-warming emissions. The plan also challenges the right of California and other states to set their own, more restrictive standards. \\r\\nSenator John Barrasso of Wyoming, chairman of the Environment and Public Works panel, said he expected the committee to vote on Mr. Wheeler\u2019s confirmation in February and, soon after, bring the vote to the Senate floor. \\r\\nBut if the hearing itself is any indication, Mr. Wheeler could be in for a rocky tenure. His opening remarks, given as the government entered its 26th day of a partial shutdown, were nearly drowned out by demonstrators shouting \u201cShut down Wheeler, not the E.P.A.\u201d The protesters were escorted out of the hearing room by Capitol Police officers as Mr. Wheeler began speaking.\\r\\n\u201cMr. Wheeler is certainly not the ethically bereft embarrassment that Scott Pruitt proved to be,\u201d Senator Tom Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat on the committee, said in his opening remarks. At the same time, he and other lawmakers pressed Mr. Wheeler on the string of regulatory rollbacks as well as his and Mr. Trump\u2019s positions on climate change.\\r\\n\u201cThe scientific community has said the threat of climate change is one of the great crises facing our planet,\u201d Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said. \u201cDo you agree?\u201d\\r\\nMr. Wheeler said he believed that climate change is occurring, and that humans have an effect. But he told the committee: \u201cI would not call it the greatest crisis, no sir. I would call it a huge issue that has to be addressed globally.\u201d\\r\\nIt was after that exchange that he made his remark to Mr. Merkley putting his level of concern at \u201ceight or nine.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Wheeler was asked several times by Democrats if he would denounce Mr. Trump\u2019s statement that climate change is a \u201choax.\u201d Mr. Wheeler responded, \u201cI have not used the hoax word myself.\u201d\\r\\nHe said that the planet is warming and that mankind plays a role, making Mr. Wheeler one of the few members of the Trump administration to openly acknowledge the basics of established climate science. But he also said he had not familiarized himself with major scientific reports, including one conducted by 13 United States agencies, that warned rising global emissions are an urgent crisis.\\r\\nHe said that the E.P.A. under his leadership was addressing the challenge of rising carbon emissions. Mr. Wheeler repeated the Trump administration\u2019s finding that its plan to revise the Clean Power Plan would still reduce planet-warming emissions by 34 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. \\r\\nHowever, a Harvard University study published Tuesday disputed that, finding that the Trump administration\u2019s plan would be worse for the planet than doing nothing at all. The study found that greenhouse gas emissions would \u201crebound\u201d under the new policy by delaying the retirement of coal-fired power plants. Carbon emissions could rise in 18 states by as much as 8.7 percent by 2030, compared to having no carbon policy at all, the study found.\\r\\nMr. Wheeler pushed back against those numbers, saying, \u201cThat is not what the career people at the agency are telling me.\u201d Later in the hearing he said. \u201cI believe we are moving forward on a proactive basis.\u201d\\r\\nHe also addressed recent findings that carbon dioxide emissions have spiked in the United States over the past year.

Unfortunately, Dr. Google doesn\u2019t always know what\u2019s best.\\r\\nA generation ago, patients were largely dependent upon the physicians they consulted as to how best to deal with a disease like cancer. Nowadays there\u2019s the internet, replete with a virtual tsunami of information offered by all kinds of sources, from experts equipped with evidence-based facts to people selling products or outright quackery. The trick is to know how to tell the difference, especially since the disparate guidance provided can become a matter of life or death.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy for people to land on a site filled with misinformation that leads them to make decisions that may not be in their best interests,\u201d Dr. Lidia Schapira, medical oncologist at Stanford University Medical Center, told me. She is editor of the very reliable site, www.cancer.net, that provides clear, scientifically vetted information about cancer and its treatment for patients, their families and friends.\\r\\nAs a specialist in breast cancer, Dr. Schapira has treated women who decline postoperative therapy with a drug like tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor because they read on the web that the treatments are harmful, despite extensive studies showing they can help prevent a breast cancer recurrence. \u201cThe conviction about harm is an emotional reaction, and it\u2019s very difficult for a doctor to talk facts through emotions,\u201d she said.\\r\\nAs the American Cancer Society cautions, \u201cThe wrong information can hurt you when it comes to cancer. A lot of what passes for cancer information on the internet is made up of opinion, salesmanship, and testimonials and is not grounded in careful science. Anyone can post any kind of information online, and some people may be passing along information that\u2019s limited, inaccurate or just plain wrong. Some even try to deceive you.\u201d\\r\\nWorried about an unexplained symptom? The internet offers about two dozen \u201csymptom checkers,\u201d and patients can actually freak themselves out by searching the web for their symptoms and finding cancer as a possible cause. Just about any symptom, from a persistent cough to chronic constipation, can be caused by cancer, but a qualified doctor can readily rule out cancer with a proper medical examination and review of a patient\u2019s personal and family history.\\r\\nLast year in The Hartford Courant, Dr. David W. Wolpaw, a family physician in Manchester, Conn., described a man in his 20s with a weekslong sore throat who had done an internet search and thought he had oral cancer. The doctor reported that the man lacked risk factors for cancer, and an exam showed he had nothing worse than a cold.\\r\\n\u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t expect a website to replace their physician,\u201d Dr. Wolpaw wrote. In addition to having completed many years of education and hands-on experience, \u201cyour doctor knows you, your medical history, family history, risk factors, etc., much better than the internet,\u201d he added. Furthermore, he wrote, \u201csites can look trustworthy even when they post information not supported by scientific evidence.\u201d\\r\\nPeople looking for the latest iteration of snake oil will surely find it on the web. Steer clear! The cancer society cautions to beware of any postings that make claims like \u201cscientific breakthrough,\u201d \u201csecret ingredient,\u201d \u201cmiraculous cure\u201d or ancient remedy,\u201d as well as products offering money-back guarantees, available from only one source or said to cure a wide range of ailments.\\r\\nThat said, people facing cancer often can glean valuable information and support through the internet. \u201cThe internet can be a tool that can give people access to good scientifically vetted information,\u201d Dr. Schapira said. \u201cIt can help patients be better prepared for a consultation with an expert. And after such a consultation, they can check on the wisdom of the advice they got.\u201d\\r\\nShe suggests relying on web-based resources that are free of commercial interests. Even sites posted by medical institutions can be self-promoting. In addition to www.cancer.net, which is prepared by members of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, Dr. Schapira recommended information offered by the American Cancer Society (www.cancer.org) and the National Cancer Institute (www.cancer.gov), as well as the free patient-oriented arm of a site called UpToDate that translates into lay terms the best available information that doctors get. \\r\\nThe cancer institute notes that the three letters attached to a site\u2019s domain name can give people insight into the independence and validity of information it contains; best to choose .edu or .gov over .com.\\r\\nIn addition to providing valuable information and guidance to trustworthy sources, the internet can help patients glean psychosocial support through online groups. In a review of 170 studies of patients who use information technology, Danielle Gentile of the Levine Cancer Institute of Atrium Health in Charlotte, N.C., and her co-authors found that social media communities can be very helpful to cancer patients, especially those who lack personal social support. Cancer patients can converse with others, anonymously or otherwise, about emotional and spiritual issues and glean helpful firsthand tips on dealing with treatment-related issues.\\r\\nBut while some online communities \u201care curated by medical professionals, others may be posted by people who have no scientific knowledge,\u201d Dr. Schapira cautioned. The information patients glean through such lay communities is best discussed with their doctors lest they be led down the garden path of bad advice.\\r\\nShe also suggested that patients not be pressured to research their cancers until and unless they are emotionally and intellectually ready to deal with the information they uncover.\\r\\n\u201cIt may be better to let others look things up,\u201d she said. \u201cDifferent people need different information at different times. Some people are not ready to absorb all the information upfront, and that\u2019s completely normal. Some want to receive the information but leave decisions to the experts, while others want to have a hand in making the decisions.\u201d\\r\\nDon\u2019t be afraid to discuss alternative remedies with the doctors treating your cancer, and be sure to tell them about any such remedy you plan to try in case it can interact badly with prescribed treatments. Nearly all major medical centers now have departments of integrative medicine, and today\u2019s oncologists are well aware of how much the mind can influence the body\u2019s well-being, Dr. Schapira said.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1261007473,\"description\":\"Dr. Google doesn\u2019t always know what\u2019s best.\\r\",\"title\":\"Personal Health: When Cancer Meets the Internet\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"health.15.txt\"}],\"labelMap\":[[744716624,\"health\"],[-771583032,\"technology\"],[-753305417,\"world\"],[-1898459496,\"business\"],[1657028483,\"world\"],[-783835124,\"technology\"],[-476441678,\"business\"],[-445713388,\"business\"],[-1490783143,\"world\"],[788528588,\"world\"],[2035964461,\"health\"],[-1414196775,\"technology\"],[-1413757249,\"business\"],[-2063294509,\"business\"],[-430270314,\"health\"],[-1094504659,\"science\"],[1589556157,\"science\"],[-713484201,\"world\"],[1827469542,\"world\"],[-394144843,\"technology\"],[-787975219,\"business\"],[-1525035125,\"technology\"],[-621936301,\"world\"],[-782052188,\"science\"],[857785162,\"science\"],[1261007473,\"health\"],[1446855515,\"world\"],[-1615598764,\"business\"],[-677372880,\"world\"],[-788369064,\"business\"],[-912019104,\"world\"],[-331952209,\"science\"],[1763094825,\"technology\"],[1691764127,\"technology\"],[-1720052767,\"health\"],[-929925753,\"world\"],[189579811,\"business\"],[1023035361,\"world\"],[-1138956957,\"technology\"],[430059624,\"science\"],[-242681196,\"health\"],[772145717,\"technology\"],[-81222030,\"business\"],[-1631127366,\"world\"],[-2008072080,\"technology\"],[996113641,\"world\"],[-621199876,\"business\"],[115072823,\"technology\"],[216869378,\"business\"],[979802475,\"technology\"],[951101460,\"business\"],[-259757828,\"science\"],[-1741665359,\"technology\"],[-1896161526,\"business\"],[-204444614,\"world\"],[-275112213,\"world\"],[-113826969,\"technology\"],[1909517249,\"health\"],[-1936711235,\"world\"],[484957069,\"world\"],[-1973712285,\"world\"],[571503521,\"technology\"],[309217200,\"world\"],[1485903018,\"business\"],[1247966159,\"business\"],[-1098402478,\"business\"],[1111125378,\"world\"],[1834607485,\"technology\"],[1398502267,\"business\"],[950150728,\"science\"],[-234580457,\"world\"],[854018702,\"world\"],[-1948748778,\"business\"],[-647669952,\"world\"],[-1170799488,\"health\"],[1305399972,\"business\"],[1308178059,\"business\"],[334877764,\"business\"],[2124488777,\"business\"],[1269534550,\"science\"],[1528840498,\"technology\"],[1903783804,\"science\"],[-1109331175,\"science\"],[-207050379,\"business\"],[-1273329071,\"world\"],[826245742,\"science\"],[922441747,\"business\"],[-1965193406,\"business\"],[-1080452082,\"world\"],[1613553776,\"health\"]],\"confusionMatrix\":[[11,0,0,2,3],[2,1,4,1,3],[4,1,3,2,4],[1,0,1,8,2],[5,0,0,1,7]],\"confusionLabels\":[\"business\",\"health\",\"science\",\"technology\",\"world\"],\"relabelingLabelMap\":[[-1413757249,\"business\"],[-783835124,\"technology\"],[-782052188,\"science\"],[2035964461,\"health\"],[744716624,\"health\"],[1589556157,\"science\"],[-1490783143,\"world\"],[-621936301,\"world\"],[-1720052767,\"health\"],[-912019104,\"world\"],[-713484201,\"world\"],[-242681196,\"health\"],[-677372880,\"world\"],[-1094504659,\"science\"],[-331952209,\"science\"],[-430270314,\"health\"],[1909517249,\"health\"],[-113826969,\"technology\"],[772145717,\"technology\"],[-275112213,\"world\"],[1398502267,\"business\"],[334877764,\"business\"],[-1080452082,\"world\"],[1261007473,\"health\"],[-234580457,\"health\"],[-1948748778,\"world\"],[-787975219,\"health\"],[-259757828,\"health\"],[-929925753,\"health\"]],\"accuracy\":0.5888888888888889,\"correctRelabeled\":[-1413757249,-783835124,-782052188,2035964461,744716624,1589556157,-1490783143,-1720052767,-912019104,-1094504659,-331952209,-430270314,1909517249,-275112213,-1080452082],\"labelingPrecision\":0.625,\"labelingRecall\":0.40540540540540543,\"correctAssignedItems\":[-1413757249,-783835124,-782052188,2035964461,744716624,1589556157,-1490783143,-621936301,-1720052767,-912019104,-713484201,-242681196,-1094504659,-331952209,-430270314,1909517249,-113826969,772145717,-275112213,1398502267,334877764,-1080452082,1261007473],\"assignmentPrecision\":0.625,\"openedItems\":[],\"numOpenedItems\":0,\"selectedItems\":[],\"selectedInCategory\":0,\"selectionRecall\":null},{\"modelOperation\":\"add\",\"changedFiles\":[{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"With its $500 million pledge to address affordable housing in the Seattle area, Microsoft isn\u2019t primarily cutting checks to local charities.

And capital funds to repair the remaining public housing stock have been cut in half over the last 15 years. \\r\\nOver this time, federal resources have increasingly shifted away from subsidizing the construction of affordable housing to subsidizing renters who find housing in the private market. And now most new below-market-rate housing is built not by public agencies, but by nonprofit developers leveraging tax credits. The value of those credits has declined recently as well, as a result of changes in the tax bill passed in 2017.\\r\\nIn a sense, Microsoft\u2019s proposal is an extension of this story, as private actors continue to step in where the government once stood.\\r\\n\u201cOur part to play is to bring capital to solve this problem,\u201d Microsoft\u2019s president, Brad Smith, said at an event introducing the plan on Thursday. \\r\\nToday in the Seattle region, the problem isn\u2019t simply that government support has dwindled. Construction and land costs to build new housing have risen, and the wages that low-skilled workers can afford to spend on rent have stagnated.\\r\\n\u201cThere is no public entity that can fill a hole as big as this,\u201d Mr. Smith said. If the only focus is putting money into public housing, he said, \u201cit will go too slowly and you will end up with housing that may not stand the test of time.\u201d\\r\\nMicrosoft says it plans to spend $25 million on grants to local nonprofits working on homelessness. But the bulk of the money will be invested, some in affordable housing developments that use tax credits, and others in middle-class developments that wouldn't be financially feasible without lower-interest loans. \\r\\nAs those loans are repaid, Microsoft will lend the capital to other developments as well, in theory leveraging the money to create what Microsoft estimates could be tens of thousands of units of housing, or far more than would be possible if the company simply spent the money directly building apartments itself.\\r\\nEd Goetz, a professor at the University of Minnesota who has studied the history of public housing in America, said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to diminish the magnitude of what they\u2019re doing. I think it\u2019s important, and it will help. But it won\u2019t solve Seattle\u2019s problem.\u201d \\r\\nMicrosoft has called for other companies to become involved. But Mr. Goetz said he couldn\u2019t imagine a situation where there were enough Microsofts out there to truly address the country\u2019s housing crisis.\\r\\n\u201cThe federal government is the entity that has the resources to do this,\u201d Mr. Goetz said.\\r\\nDiane Yentel, the president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said she would welcome a trend in which more major tech companies put up money to address housing. But she warned of the risk of further letting the government off the hook. \\r\\n\u201cToday\u2019s modern phenomenon of homelessness didn\u2019t exist in the late 1970s because our country housed almost everyone, including the lowest-income and most vulnerable families,\u201d Ms. Yentel said in an email. \u201cThe key difference between then and now is declining federal subsidies.\u201d\\r\\nAs Microsoft unveiled its plans, the Department of Housing and Urban Development remained largely shuttered in Washington during the government shutdown. Federal contracts with hundreds of property owners who provide housing to subsidized tenants have expired during the shutdown, leaving thousands of families at risk of losing their homes. \\r\\nActivists in communities like Seattle have made a strong case that tech companies bear some responsibility for making the housing crisis worse. Those companies have brought thousands of highly paid workers into housing markets that don\u2019t have room for everyone. But among the many culprits behind the crisis, the government\u2019s retrenchment is critical, too.\\r\\n\u201cThis is a problem that is rooted in our political culture,\u201d Mr. Lasner said. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem that\u2019s rooted in the myths we tell ourselves about who we are as Americans. We\u2019ve always been skittish and uncomfortable with the idea of housing subsidies, or even interventions like rent control.\u201d \\r\\nAmericans are more comfortable with private-sector solutions, he said. But for an area as complicated as housing, he added, \u201cthey\u2019re not enough to cope with the challenge.\u201d\\r\\nKaren Weise contributed reporting.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":45788846,\"description\":\"The pledge of $500 million to help build affordable housing in Seattle reflects a nationwide void in addressing the problem.\\r\",\"title\":\"Microsoft\u2019s Leap Into Housing Illuminates Government\u2019s Retreat\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"business.39.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"THE AGE OF SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power By Shoshana Zuboff 691 pp. PublicAffairs. $38\\r\\nCanadian politicians don\u2019t attract much notice this side of the border, but recently I\u2019ve been heeding the words of Charlie Angus. A member of Canada\u2019s Parliament for the New Democratic Party, Angus is a longtime punk rocker and activist with ties to the Catholic Worker movement; he\u2019s also a sharp critic of the growing power of Big Tech. In late November, Angus attended a hearing in British Parliament in which representatives from nine countries took turns interrogating a Facebook vice president about the company\u2019s proliferating scandals (an empty chair sat before a Mark Zuckerberg nameplate, marking the chief executive\u2019s absence).\\r\\nFor Angus, fake news and data-based manipulation \u2014 exemplified by the shadowy work of Cambridge Analytica, whose voter-profiling scheme is often cited as an important factor in Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 victory \u2014 were mere symptoms of a larger malady. \u201cThe problem is Facebook,\u201d he declared. \u201cThe problem is the unprecedented economic control of every form of social discourse and communication.\u201d It was one of Angus\u2019s colleagues, the Canadian member of Parliament Bob Zimmer, who may be the one who gave the problem a name: \u201cSurveillance capitalism,\u201d he said, with its vast concentrations of data and influence over human life, required new laws and new forms of regulation.\\r\\nBoth Angus and Zimmer were right, but before we can establish a firm legislative or regulatory agenda, we have to learn what surveillance capitalism is, as we come to terms with the novel form of economic and social power represented by Facebook, Google and a handful of other tech behemoths privy to our every click and utterance. Enter, as a critical guide, Shoshana Zuboff, who has emerged as the leading explicator of surveillance capitalism. A Harvard Business School professor emerita with decades of experience studying issues of labor and power in the digital economy, Zuboff in 2015 published a paper, \u201cBig Other: Surveillance Capitalism and the Prospects of an Information Civilization,\u201d which has since become an essential source for anyone looking to reckon seriously with what she described as a distinct, emerging economic logic. Now she has followed up that paper with a doorstop of a book, an intensively researched, engagingly written chronicle of surveillance capitalism\u2019s origins and its deleterious prospects for our society.\\r\\nAccording to Zuboff, surveillance capitalism distinguishes itself from its industrial forebear as \u201ca new economic order that claims human experience as a free source of raw material.\u201d We are the resource to be mined; the billion-dollar profits of Facebook and Google are built on a general accounting of our lives and everyday behavior. But surveillance capitalism is also many other things: \u201ca parasitic economic logic \u2026 a rogue mutation of capitalism \u2026 a new collective order based on total certainty\u201d and \u201can overthrow of the people\u2019s sovereignty.\u201d All this may sound a little heady, like perhaps an overseasoned stew of po-mo economic jargon, but Zuboff will have you asking for another helping long before the book\u2019s end.\\r\\nSurveillance capitalism depends on the constant gathering of \u201cbehavioral surplus,\u201d or the data exhaust that we produce as part of the normal course of web browsing, app use and digital consumption. All of it is potentially revealing, allowing companies to make sophisticated inferences about who we are, what we want and what we\u2019re likely to do. As the economist Hal Varian noted in 2002, \u201cEvery action a user performs is considered a signal to be analyzed and fed back into the system.\u201d That means that there is potentially no end to a surveillance capitalist\u2019s extractive appetite, which is why \u2014 in the name of more efficient services and relevant ads \u2014 companies are constantly pursuing new, more granular data streams in our homes, workplaces and bodies. Unlike oil, to which it\u2019s often compared, personal data is potentially limitless, but its extraction and consumption may be just as toxic, as we\u2019re only beginning to understand.\\r\\nUnder the regime of surveillance capitalism, it is not enough simply to gather information about what people do. Eventually, you have to influence behavior, beyond the simple suasion practiced by targeted ads. It\u2019s not about showing someone the right ad; you have to show it at the right place and time, with the language and imagery calibrated for precise effect. You have to lead people through the physical world, making them show up at the sponsored pop-up store or vote for the preferred candidate. Armed with a veritable real-time feed of a user\u2019s thoughts and feelings, companies are beginning to practice just this kind of coercion, which is why you might see makeup ads before a Friday evening out or why inducements from a personal injury lawyer might pop up on your phone as you sit in a hospital waiting room. When we want things \u2014 health information, travel schedules, a date \u2014 is also when we are most vulnerable, when intimate data yield themselves for corporate capture. \u201cThe result,\u201d as Zuboff notes, \u201cis a perverse amalgam of empowerment inextricably layered with diminishment.\u201d We seem ever more exposed to and dependent on surveillance capitalists, our benevolent info-lords, but their operations are defined by opacity, corporate secrecy and the scrim of technological authority.\\r\\nIn the face of all this, Zuboff sees a disastrous overturning of the traditional capitalist order. We are being pushed \u201ctoward a society in which capitalism does not function as a means to inclusive economic or political institutions.\u201d With statements like these, Zuboff threatens to lose those readers who don\u2019t share her regard for a bygone halcyon era of industrial capitalism that produced what she calls \u201ctraditional reciprocities,\u201d defined by straightforward exchanges of money for goods and services, which in turn bound people together in ostensibly healthy social, economic and political arrangements. Zuboff\u2019s analysis would benefit from more emphasis on the role of deregulation, the declining power of organized labor and the gradual financialization of the economy. With its ability to create boutique investment products that are several degrees removed from any tangible asset, it\u2019s finance that seems like the most obvious ideological forebear of surveillance capitalism, which uses digitalization to render more of life as tradable commodities.\\r\\nBut Zuboff\u2019s capacious book has room for minority opinions and other forms of dissent. \u201cThe Age of Surveillance Capitalism\u201d may lack a straightforward political program \u2014 Zuboff comes across as a liberal, albeit not one who slots neatly on the left-right axis \u2014 but it is loaded with useful economic, technological and anthropological analysis. (In this political vacuum, I\u2019d recommend the work of Trebor Scholz, a New School professor who has made a winning case for what he calls platform co-ops \u2014 nonprofit, worker-owned tech platforms that would lack the perverse incentives of surveillance capitalism.)\\r\\nWe should, after all, avoid a belief in tidy solutions. Works of technology criticism are often expected to provide a few hundred pages of doomsaying before providing a concise final chapter in which the Gordian knot of our problems is neatly and improbably cut. \u201cThe Age of Surveillance Capitalism,\u201d with its near-700-page footprint, is thankfully not that kind of book. Light on prescriptivist notions, Zuboff does propose a \u201cright to sanctuary,\u201d based on universalist, if ever more threatened, humanitarian principles, like the right to asylum. But she\u2019s after something bigger, providing a scaffolding of critical thinking from which to examine the great crises of the digital age. Through her we learn that our friends to the north were indeed correct: Facebook is the problem (along with Google, Microsoft, Amazon, et al.). This is the rare book that we should trust to lead us down the long hard road of understanding.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1854252144,\"description\":\"Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s \u201cThe Age of Surveillance Capitalism\u201d looks at the new power of behemoths like Facebook and Google.\\r\",\"title\":\"Nonfiction: How Tech Companies Manipulate Our Personal Data\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"business.41.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"BEIJING \u2014 A beer in one hand, a microphone in the other, Meng Xiaoli stood in a crowded restaurant and began to sing.\\r\\nYour smile is as sweet as honey,\\r\\nJust like flowers blooming in the spring breeze.\\r\\nI wonder where I\u2019ve seen you.\\r\\nDuring the workweek, Mr. Meng, 53, a strait-laced budget analyst who wears a red Chinese Communist Party pin on his lapel, spends his days shuttling between meetings and poring over reports as a budget analyst for a state-owned firm.\\r\\nBut on weekends, he retreats to what he calls his \u201cspiritual home,\u201d a two-story restaurant and museum in Beijing that is a shrine to the woman he considers a goddess: the Taiwanese pop singer Teresa Teng, one of Asia\u2019s most celebrated artists.\\r\\n\u201cShe knows what it\u2019s like to be human \u2014 to find love and to make mistakes,\u201d Mr. Meng said.\\r\\nMs. Teng, who died suddenly in 1995 at age 42, was renowned for turning traditional Taiwanese and Chinese folk songs into maudlin Western-style hits. She was once banned in the mainland, her music denounced by the authorities as \u201cdecadent\u201d and \u201cpornographic.\u201d\\r\\nBut she never lost her base of rabid fans here, even as tensions have escalated between China and Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing considers part of its territory.\\r\\nHer most ardent followers now gather at the Teresa Teng Music-Themed Restaurant in a sprawling residential neighborhood in western Beijing, near liquor stores, barbecue joints and hot pot restaurants. An enormous portrait of Ms. Teng, smiling as she holds a white rose, graces its front door.\\r\\nInside, singers dressed in elegant gowns perform renditions of her signature ballads like \u201cThe Moon Represents My Heart\u201d and \u201cSweet as Honey.\u201d Customers sample dishes inspired by Ms. Teng\u2019s music, including \u201cmoon pancakes\u201d and fried pumpkin with honey sauce.\\r\\nMore than two decades after her death, Ms. Teng\u2019s mainland fans say her sugary voice and gentle personality are still one of a kind.\\r\\n\u201cShe\u2019s a storyteller,\u201d said Zheng Rongbin, the media executive who opened the restaurant in 2011. \u201cShe looks like the girl next door.\u201d\\r\\nAt a recent lunchtime performance, Wu Yingwei, 30, watched as her daughter, Muyao, 2, danced to a performance of \u201cAsk Yourself,\u201d a song that is a staple of karaoke bars in Asia.\\r\\nMs. Wu said her daughter liked listening only to Ms. Teng\u2019s songs and could sing several of her hits, including \u201cSweet as Honey.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cTeresa Teng\u2019s style never gets old,\u201d she said. \u201cHer songs are very gentle and make me feel really warm.\u201d\\r\\nMs. Teng is claimed by many mainlanders as one of their own, even though she was born in Taiwan.\\r\\nHer father, who grew up in the mainland in the northern province of Hebei, was part of the Nationalist forces that fought Mao Zedong\u2019s Communists in the Chinese Civil War. He retreated to Taiwan in 1949, four years before Ms. Teng\u2019s birth.\\r\\nMs. Teng was one of the first foreign singers whose music flowed into China after it began opening its economy to the world in the late 1970s.\\r\\nBut her music was quickly banned as part of a campaign by the Communist government to block \u201cspiritual pollution\u201d from the West. The Taiwanese government used her music as a psychological weapon, blasting it from loudspeakers positioned near the mainland.\\r\\nTapes of Ms. Teng\u2019s music circulated on a black market in the mainland, and her popularity was clear. Because of her surname, which in Chinese uses the same character as the Communist leader Deng Xiaoping\u2019s, she was sometimes referred to as Little Deng, reflecting her hold on the public imagination.\\r\\nMs. Teng occasionally veered into politics, holding concerts to show solidarity with the pro-democracy protesters who gathered at Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989. She never performed in the mainland.\\r\\nIn recent years, however, the government has warmed to her music, and the state-run media has celebrated her mainland roots.\\r\\nIn 2011, officials opened a memorial hall in honor of Ms. Teng in her father\u2019s hometown, Daming, where fans now converge on the anniversary of her death.\\r\\nThe mainland has at least two restaurants devoted to Ms. Teng, including the one in Beijing, which is at the center of a struggling cultural development known as Taiwan Street.\\r\\nMr. Zheng, the owner, said Ms. Teng\u2019s music was still popular in the mainland because it reminded people of hearing her songs for the first time in the years after the chaos of Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution.\\r\\n\u201cFor many people, it was a very new experience and very different from what they had heard in the Cultural Revolution,\u201d he said. \u201cNow when people hear it, they remember what it was like to be young.\u201d\\r\\nMs. Teng has been hailed as a symbol of commonality between China and Taiwan at a time when relations have deteriorated, with President Xi Jinping of China recently warning that efforts by Taiwan to assert independence could be met by armed force.\\r\\nBut Mr. Zheng said he did not have politics in mind when he opened the restaurant. \u201cMusic has no sense of borders,\u201d he said.\\r\\nThe Beijing restaurant, which is officially recognized by Ms. Teng\u2019s family in Taiwan, also includes a museum, on the first floor, displaying some of Ms. Teng\u2019s dresses, pianos and clocks. On the second floor is the performance hall, with a chandelier and a disco ball.\\r\\nOn busy nights, hundreds of people pack into the hall, gathering around tables covered with red-checkered tablecloths. Some guests opt for private rooms, where they sing karaoke versions of Ms. Teng\u2019s songs.\\r\\nOn a recent night, Wang Liang, 36, paid $15 to request a live performance of \u201cI Only Care About You\u201d for his wife and daughter.\\r\\n\u201cEver since I was a child, I\u2019ve always liked Teresa Teng\u2019s songs,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cHer songs aren\u2019t as flippant as pop songs now, and they really stick in your memory.\u201d\\r\\nOne of the singers at the restaurant, Wang Xin, 25, who was trained as a classical pianist, said Ms. Teng\u2019s supple singing style, rich with vibrato, is difficult to imitate.\\r\\n\u201cThe emotions are hard to capture,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to find the right tone.\u201d\\r\\nShe practices by listening to Ms. Teng\u2019s songs on repeat on her phone.\\r\\nAt a recent show, Ms. Wang, wearing fake eyelashes and red lipstick to evoke Ms. Teng, approached the microphone to sing one of the pop star\u2019s tougher standards, \u201cWhat Do You Have to Say?\u201d:\\r\\nI waited for more than a year,\\r\\nThree-hundred sixty-five days isn\u2019t easy,\\r\\nYou simply don\u2019t have me in your heart,\\r\\nGive me my love back!\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1438233615,\"description\":\"Rabid fans flock to a restaurant serving as a shrine to the singer Teresa Teng, whose music was banned in China for being \u201cdecadent.\u201d Long after her death, the government has warmed to her appeal.\\r\",\"title\":\"Beijing Dispatch: In the Heart of Beijing, a Taiwanese Pop Idol Makes Fans Swoon\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"world.26.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"For three years, terrorists controlled a huge stretch of territory in Iraq and Syria.

Jones, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the author of the center\u2019s recent study assessing ISIS\u2019 troop strength.\\r\\n\u201cWhen you lose territory, smart groups shift to guerrilla strategy and tactics, including targeted assassinations, ambushes, raids, bombings,\u201d he added. \u201cThat is how you wear the enemy down.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Trump\u2019s declaration that ISIS has been defeated is the second time the group has been described this way.\\r\\nA decade ago, the group then known as the Islamic State of Iraq had been pummeled so hard that officials estimated it was down to its last 700 fighters. Over one 90-day period, American forces arrested or killed 34 of the group\u2019s top 42 leaders.\\r\\nWith his troops exhausted and outnumbered, the emir of the terrorist group privately lamented that they could no longer hold ground.\\r\\n\u201cWe now have no place where we can stand for even a quarter of an hour,\u201d the emir, Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, is said to have told his deputies, according to the group\u2019s own account of the period before the American troop withdrawal from Iraq was completed in 2011.\\r\\nBut after that withdrawal, the group rapidly rebuilt itself, and just four years later succeeded in seizing a territory the size of Britain.\\r\\nRecent estimates indicate that the Islamic State has more than 20 to 30 times the fighters it had the last time it was left for dead.\\r\\nAlthough many of its leaders have been killed, the group\u2019s caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and several of his top deputies, are believed to be alive.\\r\\nBut the crumbling of the state has made it difficult to recruit and only a trickle of new members are believed to still be heading to the region from overseas, down from the thousands that were crossing into their territory before.\\r\\nMeanwhile, attacks have dropped in certain critical locations, like Iraq. That doesn\u2019t mean the group doesn\u2019t remain lethal there. In 2018 in the months after Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared victory over ISIS, the group carried out over 1,200 attacks just in Iraq, according to one data set.\\r\\nAlso, the group\u2019s acolytes continue to kill around the world, including last month in one of Europe\u2019s Christmas markets, in Strasbourg, France, where a gunman who had left a pledge of allegiance to ISIS on a USB stick killed five people, and on a trail in Morocco\u2019s Atlas Mountains, where a group of men who also had recorded a pledge killed two  Scandinavian tourists.\\r\\nWith the attack on the Syrian restaurant, the world was again reminded of the group\u2019s ability to carry out deadly attacks.\\r\\nTwo American troops were killed in that suicide bombing, doubling the death toll for United States forces killed in combat since the start of their four-year deployment to Syria.\\r\\n\u201cEveryone knows, and we have always said, that the battle against ISIS has not ended, the danger of ISIS has not ended,\u201d said Shervan Darwish, the spokesman for the Manbij Military Council, where the attack occurred. \u201cISIS still has power, still has cells and it is working to reorganize its ranks.\u201d\\r\\nThree different reports released late last year \u2014 by the Pentagon inspector general, the United Nations and the Center for Strategic and International Studies \u2014 estimated that ISIS has 20,000 to 30,000 members in Iraq and Syria alone.\\r\\nThose figures do not account for the thousands of fighters based in the caves of Afghanistan, in the scrubland of Niger and Mali, in the Sinai Desert, in lawless stretches of Libya and Yemen, and in the numerous other countries where affiliates of the group have taken hold.\\r\\nOnline, the terror group has repeatedly boasted about how the United States\u2019 pullout is evidence that the Islamic State has outlasted the American operation.\\r\\nIn one video narrated by a well-known ISIS propagandist, Turjman Aswarti, the terror group brags that they are stronger now than the last time American forces withdrew.\\r\\n\u201cWhen Obama announced America\u2019s flight from Iraq, the fire of our war was only burning in Iraq,\u201d he says, according to a translation provided by the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist content. \u201cToday the flames of war are still burning in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen, Sinai, East Africa and Libya,\u201d he said, naming the other countries where ISIS affiliates have flourished.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious that the group today is vastly more powerful than the Islamic State of Iraq was then,\u201d said Brian Fishman, a former director of research at the Combating Terrorism Center at the United States Military Academy in West Point and the author of book on the rise of ISIS.\\r\\nExperts say the White House is mistakenly equating the group\u2019s shrunken territorial holdings with its overall strength.\\r\\nFrom its peak four years ago, when it held almost half of Syria and a third of Iraq, the Islamic State has now lost all but a fraction of the land it once held in the region.\\r\\nBut it has made a tactical shift to a guerrilla strategy, as Mr. Jones of the strategic and international studies group described it.\\r\\nISIS announced this tactical shift as early as 2017, in an article in Naba, its weekly newsletter, said Hassan Hassan, a senior fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy in Washington.\\r\\nIn the newsletter, the Islamic State compared its situation now with the tatters it was in before the last American pullout.\\r\\n\u201cIt became impossible in early 2008 to continue the fight in its conventional ways,\u201d ISIS said in the essay.\\r\\nThe essay explained that fighting detachments were abolished and the group\u2019s remaining fighters were all trained in using improvised explosive devices.\\r\\n\u201cInstead of clashing with the heavily equipped American Army, compared to our small and underequipped one, the fight took an absolutely new shape,\u201d the article said.\\r\\nAt the height of its territorial power, ISIS resembled a conventional army, at times rolling into battle with T-55 tanks.\\r\\nMr. Hassan has argued the group began the transition back to an insurgency as far back as 2016, a full year before it lost the most important center under its control \u2014 the Iraqi city of Mosul.\\r\\nMr. Hassan documented how, in early 2016, the group stepped up hit-and-run attacks in towns it had lost. These hasty operations appeared aimed at inflicting harm on these towns\u2019 new rulers, with no intention of regaining territorial control.\\r\\nMichael Knights, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, documented how throughout Iraq the group has focused with laserlike precision on killing \u201cmoktars,\u201d or village chiefs, as well as tribal elders and local politicians.\\r\\nThere were, on average, 15 assassination attempts against local leaders each month in the first 10 months of 2018, by Mr. Knights\u2019 count.\\r\\nThese targeted assassinations drew little coverage in the international news media, and yet they have helped undercut the trust Iraqis place in their government\u2019s ability to protect them \u2014 as well as drive young men back into ISIS\u2019s fold, Mr. Knights said.\\r\\n\u201cIf ISIS can come to your town and kill the most important person in your town any night of the year, do you feel you\u2019ve been liberated?\u201d he asked.\\r\\nThe group\u2019s current tactics mirror ISIS\u2019 strategy a decade ago, which led to its rebirth.\\r\\n\u201cThey realized you don\u2019t have to mount 6,000 attacks per month,\u201d Mr. Knights said. \u201cYou just have to kill the right 50 people each month.\u201d\\r\\nIn its own literature, the Islamic State talks about now being in a phase of \u201crasd,\u201d or surveillance.\\r\\n\u201cThey spend time learning the routine of the new security forces in town,\u201d Mr. Hassan said. \u201cThey look for security gaps. They look for patterns.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cOnce you see gaps, you start working through these gaps,\u201d he added. \u201cThey don\u2019t just have a crazy guy run out, start shooting and get killed.\u201d\\r\\nIt is in that context that analysts are viewing the deadly attack last Wednesday on American forces in Manbij.\\r\\nWith its tiled walls, shiny tables and tasty shawarma sandwiches, the Palace of Princes restaurant had become a favorite haunt of the 2,000 American troops stationed in Syria. They would pop in to pick up takeout orders before heading back on patrol. Other times they parked their armored cars in front and sat at a table.\\r\\nThe soldiers seemed to have made little effort to hide their presence or vary their routine to make it harder for enemies to track them.\\r\\nIn a newsletter ISIS released shortly after the attack, the group quoted a member of its \u201cemni,\u201d or intelligence and security branch, based inside Manbij, who explained that the militant group had regularly tried to hit American forces in rural Manbij. Their efforts failed until last week.\\r\\nIn the article, the ISIS operative explained the surveillance the group had used, saying American forces were positioned at three small bases on the outskirts of Manbij. He said United States troops moved regularly among these bases in convoys of five to 10 armored cars, escorted by guard vehicles belonging to an American-backed Kurdish militia.\\r\\nWhile it is impossible to verify the claims made in the ISIS newsletter \u2014 and the Pentagon has released no further details on the attack \u2014 the surveillance described in the article is consistent with what is known about how the group is carrying out its insurgency.\\r\\nHe explained that American soldiers entered the city in convoys of Land Cruisers, but rarely appeared outside their armored cars, according to a translation provided by the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist content.\\r\\n\u201cTo conduct an attack like this means that ISIS was conducting intelligence and reconnaissance on the movement of U.S. soldiers and had someone pre-positioned in the city so that once they got info on timing and location they could get someone on the site pretty fast,\u201d said Mr. Jones of the strategic and international studies group. \u201cThat means that in Manbij, they have a cell structure.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Jones said strikes like the one on the American troops require militants to carry out intelligence, build the bomb, transport the bomb and deploy a suicide bomber.\\r\\n\u201cIt shows they have a clandestine network,\u201d he said.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1004328290,\"description\":\"All but 1 percent of the territory the Islamic State once held in Iraq and Syria is gone, but to suggest that the group has been defeated, as President Trump did, is to ignore the lessons of recent history.\\r\",\"title\":\"Described as Defeated, Islamic State Punches Back With Guerrilla Tactics\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"world.27.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Want climate news in your inbox?

And, because that data is so widely used, neither can some other governments.\\r\\nFor example, Britain\u2019s national weather and climate monitoring service, the Met Office, publishes its own global temperature estimates that incorporate NOAA data but use a slightly different analytical method. That\u2019s important because when many different analyses show the same trend \u2014 in this case, rising global temperatures \u2014 it helps give researchers confidence that their work is sound. But, the NOAA data that the Met Office needs is currently offline. \\r\\n\u201cUsually, we would have received it by now,\u201d said John Kennedy, a scientist at the Met Office Hadley Centre, which specializes in climate research. \u201cBut this month, we haven\u2019t.\u201d \\r\\nThe global temperature numbers aren\u2019t the only climate and environmental data we would have reported by now if not for the government shutdown.\\r\\nThis time last year, for example, Americans knew that 2017 ranked as the most costly year on record for natural disasters, many of them \u2014 like Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, and the drought that struck the Great Plains \u2014 linked to climate change. \\r\\nNOAA has issued the disaster-cost estimate since 1980, but that information is not yet available for last year, which saw Hurricanes Michael and Florence, and a wildfire season that some call the deadliest and most destructive in California\u2019s history.\\r\\nResearchers say those data delays are mostly just a nuisance. It\u2019s unlikely, for example, that when the temperature data is issued it will differ significantly from preliminary estimates that placed 2018 as the fourth-warmest year on record (The Japan Meteorological agency has issued its preliminary estimates saying as much). \\r\\nThey call the interruption of key scientific research, though, a much bigger problem that will have longer lasting repercussions.\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard stories of research projects that had to be discontinued or stopped and that\u2019s thousands of dollars and in some cases, thousands of hours of time that is lost, is wasted,\u201d said Bob Peterson, president of the Entomological Society of America and a professor at Montana State University.\\r\\nIt\u2019s a bit like a child with an ant farm who goes on vacation for a month and then comes back. It\u2019s unlikely those ants will fare well. Except, in this case, there\u2019s a lot more at stake. \\r\\nInsect research may seem obscure, but Dr. Peterson noted that it helps to protect homes from destructive bugs like termites and secures our food system by helping farmers mitigate crop pests. That\u2019s especially important in the era of climate change because farmers are having to deal with invasive pests as ecosystems shift. \\r\\nIt can even save lives. There are several insects, like mosquitoes and the invasive Asian longhorn tick, that transmit diseases \u2014 to people, livestock and pets \u2014 that are the focus of at least some of the roughly 500 federal entomologists currently furloughed.\\r\\n\u201cYou just can\u2019t turn the lights off and close the door and then when the government reopens, come back and turn on the lights and open the door and then turn the computer on and, O.K., now everything\u2019s fine and we\u2019re going again,\u201d Dr. Peterson said.\\r\\nEven researchers who don\u2019t work for the federal government are affected.\\r\\n\u201cWe have a researcher studying mosquitoes and her lab colony of mosquitoes collapsed,\u201d Dr. Peterson said. \u201cThe only way to resurrect it is to get mosquito eggs from a government stock.\u201d The shutdown, though, means the government isn\u2019t currently supplying them.\\r\\nPerhaps the greatest effect, cautioned Chris Horvat, a polar oceanographer based at Brown University, is the chilling effect the government shutdown is having on early-career researchers.\\r\\nAlthough Dr. Horvat is based at Brown, he is also part of the NOAA Climate & Global Change Postdoctoral Program, a competitive fellowship that the agency has offered since 1990 to help early-career scientists do climate research. Officially, the eight fellows are government contractors, not employees, which means they can\u2019t expect back pay for time they don\u2019t work. Their contract administrator has them on a reduced salary of roughly half pay, but that is set to run out in three weeks, Dr. Horvat said.\\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019re basically not able to, you know, pay for travel or go to do research stuff,\u201d Dr. Horvat said. \u201cWe\u2019re all super early career so having money is essential. We don\u2019t have grants, you know, we don\u2019t have support from anywhere else.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be the future of climate science and we can\u2019t do our jobs.\u201d\\r\\nFor more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-494168399,\"description\":\"A key global temperature report isn\u2019t coming out this week because of missing data, and some long-term research projects are at risk.\\r\",\"title\":\"Here\u2019s How the Shutdown Is Delaying Climate Data and Undercutting Scientists\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.36.txt\"}],\"labelMap\":[[744716624,\"health\"],[-771583032,\"technology\"],[-753305417,\"world\"],[-1898459496,\"business\"],[1657028483,\"world\"],[-783835124,\"technology\"],[-476441678,\"business\"],[-445713388,\"business\"],[-1490783143,\"world\"],[788528588,\"world\"],[2035964461,\"health\"],[-1414196775,\"technology\"],[-1413757249,\"business\"],[-2063294509,\"business\"],[-430270314,\"health\"],[-1094504659,\"science\"],[1589556157,\"science\"],[-713484201,\"world\"],[1827469542,\"world\"],[-394144843,\"technology\"],[-787975219,\"business\"],[-1525035125,\"technology\"],[-621936301,\"world\"],[-782052188,\"science\"],[857785162,\"science\"],[1261007473,\"health\"],[1446855515,\"world\"],[-1615598764,\"business\"],[-677372880,\"world\"],[-788369064,\"business\"],[-912019104,\"world\"],[-331952209,\"science\"],[1763094825,\"technology\"],[1691764127,\"technology\"],[-1720052767,\"health\"],[-929925753,\"world\"],[189579811,\"business\"],[1023035361,\"world\"],[-1138956957,\"technology\"],[430059624,\"science\"],[-242681196,\"health\"],[772145717,\"technology\"],[-81222030,\"business\"],[-1631127366,\"world\"],[-2008072080,\"technology\"],[996113641,\"world\"],[-621199876,\"business\"],[115072823,\"technology\"],[216869378,\"business\"],[979802475,\"technology\"],[951101460,\"business\"],[-259757828,\"science\"],[-1741665359,\"technology\"],[-1896161526,\"business\"],[-204444614,\"world\"],[-275112213,\"world\"],[-113826969,\"technology\"],[1909517249,\"health\"],[-1936711235,\"world\"],[484957069,\"world\"],[-1973712285,\"world\"],[571503521,\"technology\"],[309217200,\"world\"],[1485903018,\"business\"],[1247966159,\"business\"],[-1098402478,\"business\"],[1111125378,\"world\"],[1834607485,\"technology\"],[1398502267,\"business\"],[950150728,\"science\"],[-234580457,\"world\"],[854018702,\"world\"],[-1948748778,\"business\"],[-647669952,\"world\"],[-1170799488,\"health\"],[1305399972,\"business\"],[1308178059,\"business\"],[334877764,\"business\"],[2124488777,\"business\"],[1269534550,\"science\"],[1528840498,\"technology\"],[1903783804,\"science\"],[-1109331175,\"science\"],[-207050379,\"business\"],[-1273329071,\"world\"],[826245742,\"science\"],[922441747,\"business\"],[-1965193406,\"business\"],[-1080452082,\"world\"],[1613553776,\"health\"],[45788846,\"technology\"],[-1854252144,\"technology\"],[1438233615,\"business\"],[1004328290,\"business\"],[-494168399,\"world\"]],\"confusionMatrix\":[[11,0,0,4,3],[2,1,4,1,3],[4,1,3,2,5],[1,0,1,8,2],[7,0,0,1,7]],\"confusionLabels\":[\"business\",\"health\",\"science\",\"technology\",\"world\"],\"relabelingLabelMap\":[[-1413757249,\"business\"],[-783835124,\"technology\"],[-782052188,\"science\"],[2035964461,\"health\"],[744716624,\"health\"],[1589556157,\"science\"],[-1490783143,\"world\"],[-621936301,\"world\"],[-1720052767,\"health\"],[-912019104,\"world\"],[-713484201,\"world\"],[-242681196,\"health\"],[-677372880,\"world\"],[-1094504659,\"science\"],[-331952209,\"science\"],[-430270314,\"health\"],[1909517249,\"health\"],[-113826969,\"technology\"],[772145717,\"technology\"],[-275112213,\"world\"],[1398502267,\"business\"],[334877764,\"business\"],[-1080452082,\"world\"],[1261007473,\"health\"],[-234580457,\"health\"],[-1948748778,\"world\"],[-787975219,\"health\"],[-259757828,\"health\"],[-929925753,\"health\"]],\"accuracy\":0.5578947368421052,\"correctRelabeled\":[-1413757249,-783835124,-782052188,2035964461,744716624,1589556157,-1490783143,-1720052767,-912019104,-1094504659,-331952209,-430270314,1909517249,-275112213,-1080452082],\"labelingPrecision\":0.625,\"labelingRecall\":0.35714285714285715,\"correctAssignedItems\":[-1413757249,-783835124,-782052188,2035964461,744716624,1589556157,-1490783143,-621936301,-1720052767,-912019104,-713484201,-242681196,-1094504659,-331952209,-430270314,1909517249,-113826969,772145717,-275112213,1398502267,334877764,-1080452082,1261007473],\"assignmentPrecision\":0.625,\"openedItems\":[],\"numOpenedItems\":0,\"selectedItems\":[],\"selectedInCategory\":0,\"selectionRecall\":null},{\"modelOperation\":\"update\",\"changedFiles\":[{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Low blood levels of vitamin D are tied to bone loss that can lead to falls and fractures.

Usually when factories sit idle during a recession, there is a reasonable expectation that they will start cranking again once the economy returns to health.\\r\\nThe road rebuilding might be expensive, but at least that money is going to pay people and businesses to do their work. The cost for society over all is that the resources that go to rebuilding the road are not available for something else that might be more valuable. That\u2019s a setback, but it\u2019s not a permanent reduction in economic potential like the less fertile farmland. And in a recession, it might even be a net positive, under the same logic that fiscal stimulus can be beneficial in a downturn.\\r\\nBy contrast, new investment in the power grid could yield long-term benefits in energy efficiency and greater reliability. \\r\\nThere\u2019s some parallel with military spending. In the 1950s and \u201960s, during the Cold War, the United States spent more than 10 percent of G.D.P. on national defense (it\u2019s now below 4 percent).\\r\\nMost of that spending crowded out other forms of economic activity; many houses and cars and washing machines weren\u2019t made because of the resources that instead went to making tanks, bombs and fighter jets. But some of that spending also created long-term benefits for society, like the innovations that led to the internet and to reliable commercial jet aircraft travel.\\r\\nCertain types of efforts to reduce carbon emissions or adapt to climate impacts are likely to generate similar benefits, says Nicholas Stern, chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics.\\r\\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t provide sea defenses at large scale without very heavy investment, but it\u2019s not investment of the kind that you get from the things that breed technological progress,\u201d Mr. Stern said. \u201cThe defensive adaptations don\u2019t carry anything like the dynamism that comes from different ways of doing things.\u201d\\r\\nThere is more fertile ground in areas like transportation and infrastructure, he said. Electric cars, instead of those with internal combustion engines, would mean less air pollution in cities, for example. \\r\\nHow should we value the future compared with the present?\\r\\nSeeking a baseline to devise environmental regulations, the Obama administration set out to calculate a \u201csocial cost of carbon,\u201d the amount of harm each new ton of carbon emissions will cause in decades ahead.\\r\\nAt the core of the project were sophisticated efforts to model how a hotter earth will affect thousands of different places. That\u2019s necessary because a low-lying region that already has many hot days a year is likely to face bigger problems, sooner, than a higher-altitude location that currently has a temperate climate.\\r\\nMichael Greenstone, who is now director of the Becker Friedman Institute at the University of Chicago and of the Energy Policy Institute there, as well as a contributor to The Upshot, was part of those efforts. \\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019ve divided the world into 25,000 regions and married that with very precise geographic predictions on how the local climate will change,\u201d Mr. Greenstone said. \u201cJust having the raw computing power to be able to analyze this at a more disaggregated level is a big part of it.\u201d\\r\\nBut even once you have an estimate of the cost of a hotter climate in future decades, some seemingly small assumptions can drastically alter the social cost of carbon today.\\r\\nFinance uses something called the discount rate to compare future value with present value. What would the promise of a $1,000 payment 10 years from now be worth to you today? Certainly something less than $1,000 \u2014 but how much less would depend on what rate you use.\\r\\nLikewise, the cost of carbon emissions varies greatly depending on how you value the well-being of people in future decades \u2014 many not born yet, and who may benefit from technologies and wealth we cannot imagine \u2014 versus our well-being today.\\r\\nThe magic of compounding means that the exact rate matters a great deal when looking at things far in the future. It\u2019s essentially the inverse of observing that a $1,000 investment that compounds at 3 percent a year will be worth about $4,400 in 50 years, whereas one that grows 7 percent per year will be worth more than $29,000.\\r\\nIn the Obama administration\u2019s analysis, using a 5 percent discount rate \u2014 which would put comparatively little weight on the well-being of future generations \u2014 would imply a social cost of $12 (in 2007 dollars) for emitting one metric ton of carbon dioxide. A metric ton is about what would be released as a car burns 113 gallons of gasoline. A 2.5 percent rate would imply a cost of $62, which adds up to hundreds of billions of dollars a year in society-wide costs at recent rates of emissions.\\r\\nThe Obama administration settled on a 3 percent discount rate that put the social cost of carbon at $42 per metric ton. The Trump administration has subsequently revised that estimate to between one dollar and seven dollars.\\r\\nThat sharp decrease was achieved in part by measuring only the future economic costs to the United States, not factoring in the rest of the world. And the Trump administration analyzed a discount rate of up to 7 percent \u2014 a rate at which even costs far into the future become trivial.\\r\\nMr. Greenstone favors substantially lower discount rates, based on evidence that financial markets also place high value on investments that protect against risk. \\r\\nUnderstood this way, spending today to reduce carbon emissions tomorrow is like insurance against some of the most costly effects of a hotter planet \u2014 and part of the debate is over how much that insurance is really worth, given that the biggest benefits are far in the future. \\r\\n\\r\\nHow might climate change fuel inequality?\\r\\nWhen a government report raises the possibility of a 10 percent hit to G.D.P. as a result of a warming climate, it can be easy to picture everyone\u2019s incomes being reduced by a tenth.\\r\\nIn reality there is likely to be enormous variance in the economic impact, depending on where people live and what kind of jobs they have.\\r\\nLow-lying, flood-prone areas are at particularly high risk of becoming unlivable \u2014 or at least uninsurable. Certain industries in certain places will be dealt a huge blow, or cease to exist; many ski slopes will turn out to be too warm for regular snow, and the map of global agriculture will shift.\\r\\nAdaptation will probably be easier for the affluent than for the poor. Those who can afford to move to an area with more favorable impacts from a warmer climate presumably will.\\r\\nSo the economic implications of climate change include huge shifts in geography, demographics and technology, with each affecting the other.\\r\\n\u201cTo look at things in terms of G.D.P. doesn\u2019t really capture what this means to people\u2019s lives,\u201d said William Nordhaus, a Yale economist who pioneered the models on which modern climate economics is based and who won a Nobel for that work. \u201cIf you just look at an average of all the things we experience, some in the marketplace and some not in the marketplace, it\u2019s insufficient. The impact is going to be highly diverse.\u201d\\r\\nCan we adapt to a warmer climate?\\r\\nDespite all these risks, it\u2019s important to remember that humanity tends to be remarkably adaptable. A century ago, most people lived without an automobile, a refrigerator, or the possibility of traveling by airplane. A couple of decades before that, almost no one had indoor plumbing.\\r\\nChanges in how people live, and the technology they use, could both mitigate the impact of climate change and ensure that the costs are less about a pure economic loss and more about rewiring the way civilization works.\\r\\nMost capital investments last only a decade or two to begin with; people are constantly rebuilding roads, buildings and other infrastructure. And a warmer climate could, if it plays out slowly enough, merely shift where that reinvestment happens.\\r\\nBut a big risk is that the change happens too quickly. Adaptation that might be manageable over a generation could be impossible \u2014 and cause mass suffering or death \u2014 if it happens over a few years.\\r\\nImagine major staple food crops being wiped out for a few consecutive years by drought or other extreme weather. Or a large coastal city wiped out in a single extreme storm.\\r\\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s jobs, consumption patterns or residential patterns, if things are changing so fast that we can\u2019t adapt to them, that will be very, very costly,\u201d Mr. Nordhaus said. \u201cWe know we can adapt to slow changes. Rapid changes are the ones that would be most damaging and painful.\u201d \\r\\nIt\u2019s clear that climate change and its ripple effects are likely to be a defining challenge of the 21st-century economy. But there are wide ranges of possible results that vary based on countless assumptions. We should also recognize that the economic backdrop of society is always changing. Projecting what that will mean for ordinary people is not simply a matter of dollars.\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent the last 20 years trying to communicate it and it\u2019s not easy to process,\u201d Joseph Aldy, who teaches at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School for Public Policy, said of the connection between climate change and the economy. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to convey something that is long term and gradual until it\u2019s not.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1948748778,\"description\":\"Many of the big economic questions in coming decades will come down to just how extreme the

most afternoons, people arrive from across New York City with backpacks and plastic bags filled with boxes of small plastic strips, forming a line on the sidewalk outside a Harlem storefront.\\r\\nHanging from the awning, a banner reads: \u201cGet cash with your extra diabetic test strips.\u201d\\r\\nEach strip is a laminate of plastic and chemicals little bigger than a fingernail, a single-use diagnostic test for measuring blood sugar. More than 30 million Americans have Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, and most use several test strips daily to monitor their condition.\\r\\nBut at this store on W. 116th Street, each strip is also a lucrative commodity, part of an informal economy in unused strips nationwide. Often the sellers are insured and paid little out of pocket for the strips; the buyers may be underinsured or uninsured, and unable to pay retail prices, which can run well over $100 for a box of 100 strips.\\r\\nSome clinicians are surprised to learn of this vast resale market, but it has existed for decades, an unusual example of the vagaries of American health care. Unlike the resale of prescription drugs, which is prohibited by law, it is generally legal to resell unused test strips. \\r\\nAnd this store is far from the only place buying. Mobile phones light up with robo-texts: \u201cWe buy diabetic test strips!\u201d Online, scores of companies thrive with names like TestStripSearch.com and QuickCash4TestStrips.com.\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019m taking advantage, as are my peers, of a loophole,\u201d said the owner of one popular site, who asked that his name not be used. \u201cWe\u2019re allowed to do that. I don\u2019t even think we should be, frankly.\u201d\\r\\nTest strips were first developed in 1965 to provide an immediate reading of blood sugar, or glucose, levels. The user pricks a finger, places a drop of blood on the strip, and inserts it into a meter that provides a reading.\\r\\nThe test strips were created for use in doctors\u2019 offices, but by 1980 medical-device manufacturers had designed meters for home use. They became the standard of care for many people with diabetes, who test their blood as often as ten times a day.\\r\\nTest strips are a multi-billion-dollar industry. A 2012 study found that among insulin-dependent patients who monitor their blood sugar, strips accounted for nearly one-quarter of pharmacy costs. Today, four manufacturers account for half of global sales.\\r\\nIn a retail pharmacy, name-brand strips command high prices. But like most goods and services in American health care, that number doesn\u2019t reflect what most people pay.\\r\\nThe sticker price is the result of behind-the-scenes negotiations between the strips\u2019 manufacturer and insurers. Manufacturers set a high list price and then negotiate to become an insurer\u2019s preferred supplier by offering a hefty rebate. \\r\\nThese transactions are invisible to the insured consumer, who might cover a copay, at most. But the arrangement leaves the uninsured \u2014 those least able to pay \u2014 paying sky-high sticker prices out of pocket. Also left out are the underinsured, who may need to first satisfy a high deductible. \\r\\nFor a patient testing their blood many times a day, paying for strips out-of-pocket could add up to thousands of dollars a year. Small wonder, then, that a gray market thrives. The middlemen buy extras from people who obtained strips through insurance, at little cost to themselves, and then resell to the less fortunate.\\r\\nThat was the opportunity that caught Chad Langley\u2019s eye. He and his twin brother launched the website Teststripz.com to solicit test strips from the public for resale. Today they buy strips from roughly 8,000 people; their third-floor office in Reading, Mass., receives around 100 deliveries a day.\\r\\nThe amount the Langleys pay depends on the brand, expiration date and condition, but the profit margins are reliably high. For example, the brothers will pay $35 plus shipping for a 100-count box of the popular brand Freestyle Lite in mint condition.\\r\\nThe Langleys sell the box for $60. CVS, by contrast, retails the strips for $164.\\r\\nThe Langleys are mainly buying up excess strips from insured patients who have been flooded with them, sometimes even when not medically necessary. \\r\\nAlthough patients who manage their diabetes with non-insulin medications or with diet and exercise needn\u2019t test their blood sugar daily, a recent analysis of insurance claims found that nearly one in seven patients still used test strips regularly.\\r\\n\u2018It\u2019s a tiny little piece of plastic that\u2019s super cheap to manufacture, and they\u2019ve managed to make a cash cow out of it.\u2019\\r\\nGretchen Obrist\\r\\nThe market glut is also a consequence of a strategy adopted by manufacturers to sell patients proprietary meters designed to read only their brand of strips. If a patient\u2019s insurer shifts her to a new brand, she must get a new meter, often leaving behind a supply of useless strips.\\r\\nWhile some resellers use websites like Amazon or eBay to market strips directly to consumers, the biggest profits are in returning them to retail pharmacies, which sell them as new and bill the customer\u2019s insurance the full price.\\r\\nThe insurer reimburses the pharmacy the retail price and then demands a partial rebate from the manufacturer \u2014 but it\u2019s a rebate the manufacturer has paid already for this box of strips.\\r\\nGlenn Johnson, general manager for market access at Abbott Diabetes Care, which makes about one in five strips purchased in the United States, said manufacturers lose more than $100 million in profits a year this way, much of it in New York, California and Florida.\\r\\nThe company supported a new California law that prohibits pharmacies from acquiring test strips from any but an authorized list of distributors. Mr. Johnson said he has spoken with lawmakers about similar efforts in Florida, New Jersey, New York and Ohio.\\r\\nSuch measures leave intact the inflated retail prices that make the gray market possible and which critics say benefit manufacturers and their retail intermediaries, pharmacy benefit managers.\\r\\nIn a lawsuit against P.B.M.\u2019s and the dominant test strip manufacturers filed in New Jersey, consumer advocates presented data showing that the average wholesale price for test strips has risen as much as 70 percent over the last decade.\\r\\nThey alleged that this has allowed the defendants to pocket an unfair portion of the rebates. The price of a strip would be much lower if it wasn\u2019t fattened by profiteering, said Gretchen Obrist, one of the lawyers who brought the case.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tiny little piece of plastic that\u2019s super cheap to manufacture, and they\u2019ve managed to make a cash cow out of it,\u201d she said.\\r\\nTo justify the rising price of strips, manufacturers point to advances in engineering that have made the strips smaller and more convenient to use. But there is little evidence those features have improved health outcomes for people with diabetes \u2014 and with increasingly unaffordable prices, the newfangled test strips may be even less accessible.\\r\\nThe markups on strips look particularly stark when compared to the cost of producing them.\\r\\n\u201cTest strips are basically printed, like in a printing press,\u201d said David Kliff, who publishes a newsletter on diabetes. \u201cIt\u2019s not brain surgery.\u201d\\r\\nHe estimated the typical test strip costs less than a dime to make.

executive after two decades at the paper. Taking his place is Sean Giancola, The Post\u2019s chief revenue officer.\\r\\nMr. Angelo, 45, started out as a stringer for Page Six, the paper\u2019s saucy, celebrity-skewering gossip column. He became a staff reporter in 1999 and quickly moved up the ranks. By age 27 he was dispatching reporters to murder scenes as metropolitan editor.\\r\\nIn 2009, he was promoted to executive editor, and took charge of The Post\u2019s digital operation. Two years later, when journalism circles considered the iPad to be the delivery system of the future, he founded The Daily, a tablet-only subscription publication. Even with a $30 million budget, it crashed and burned, but that did not stop Mr. Angelo\u2019s rise.\\r\\nHe became publisher and chief executive of The Post in 2012. In 2017, he created \u201cPage Six TV,\u201d a syndicated daily TV show along the lines of \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d and \u201cAccess Hollywood.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cAfter 20 years at The Post, it is time for me to move on and let someone else write the next chapter of this storied institution,\u201d Mr. Angelo said in a statement. \u201cI love The Post with my whole heart and wish my colleagues all the best.\u201d\\r\\nRobert J. Thomson, the chief executive of News Corporation, praised Mr. Angelo for his \u201cvaried contributions to our company as a journalist, editor and publisher, and for his leadership during the digital transformation of The Post.\u201d\\r\\nA native of Manhattan, Mr. Angelo grew up on Central Park West. His mother, Judy Hart Angelo, co-wrote the theme songs for \u201cCheers,\u201d \u201cMr. Belvedere\u201d and \u201cPunky Brewster.\u201d His father, John Angelo, founded the investment firm Angelo, Gordon & Company.\\r\\nMr. Angelo has known Rupert Murdoch\u2019s younger son, James R. Murdoch, since kindergarten. The two attended Harvard together, and Mr. Angelo was the best man in the younger Mr. Murdoch\u2019s wedding. They are still close.\\r\\nJames Murdoch, the chief executive of 21st Century Fox, is expected to step away from the family media empire in the coming months, once the i\u2019s are dotted in the $71.3 billion merger agreement between Fox and the Walt Disney Company. A former chief executive of News Corporation, Mr. Murdoch has had political differences with his brother, Lachlan, and his father, Rupert, who both lean more conservative.\\r\\nAs staff members learned of Mr. Angelo\u2019s departure, they speculated that a former Post editor in chief, Col Allan, was preparing to come out of retirement. A veteran journalist from Rupert Murdoch\u2019s home country of Australia, Mr. Allan served as editor in chief of the tabloid from 2001 to 2016 as part of a 42-year career at News Corporation, which included a long stint at The Daily Telegraph in Sydney.

Nonetheless, the city puffed out its chest, put its downtown on lockdown and hoisted the flags of the 22 member states under a mercifully rainless sky.\\r\\nThe fourth economic and social summit of the Arab League \u2014 or most of it, anyway \u2014 was hereby called to order.\\r\\n\u201cWe wished for this summit to be an occasion to bring together all the Arabs, leaving no vacant seats,\u201d the host, President Michel Aoun of Lebanon, lamented in a speech that kicked off Sunday\u2019s gathering. \u201cYet the hurdles were unfortunately stronger.\u201d\\r\\nAs if on cue, the TV cameras panned to an empty dais on which a small Libyan flag was wilting, and an eloquent gap between the Egyptian delegation and the Lebanese one. Members of a Lebanese political party had threatened to physically block the Libyans from leaving the airport if they showed up.\\r\\nSyria\u2019s empty seat was just across the vast hall, a bone of contention in the form of a large wooden desk \u2014 and a reminder that, with a few member states reopening embassies in Damascus in recent months, Syria\u2019s pariah government appeared to be progressing toward rejoining the league.\\r\\nThat, of course, might first require unearthing some kind of Arab League consensus.\\r\\nFormed at the suggestion of the British during World War II, the league was supposed to strengthen ties among Arab countries from Morocco to Oman, with the Palestinian cause their most important shared mission. It united its members in shaking off colonialism and confronting Israel, helped broker an end to Lebanon\u2019s 15-year civil war and developed a significant Israel-Palestine peace plan.\\r\\nBut by now, enfeebled by regional rivalries and disagreements, the league has acquired an all-too-mockable reputation for dysfunction. Its aged leaders have been known to fall asleep during meetings. In one recent year, one leader mused that the only thing the members had in common was the Arabic language.\\r\\nIn 2016, the league hit what was perhaps a modern low point when Morocco announced that it would not be bothering to host the annual leaders\u2019 summit. It dismissed it as \u201cjust another occasion\u201d to \u201cpronounce speeches that give a false impression of unity.\u201d When Mauritania stepped up to host instead, only seven leaders attended.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s constitutionally incapable of addressing the real problems that are facing the Middle East,\u201d said James Gelvin, a professor of Middle Eastern history at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cThat\u2019s everything from bad governance and political violence to climate change, population growth, bad health care and bad educational systems.\u201d\\r\\nMatters have not improved much since 2016.\\r\\n\u201cHalf these countries are fighting each other in wars or undermining each other,\u201d said Rami G. Khouri, a Beirut-based political columnist who has covered several Arab League summits.\\r\\nIt is only a slight exaggeration.\\r\\nIn Yemen, Saudi Arabia and its partners in the United Arab Emirates are mired in a war against the Houthis, a rebel group, a conflict that has killed tens of thousands and thrust millions to the edge of famine. (Representatives of Yemen\u2019s Saudi-backed government attended the summit, but the league took no action to address the humanitarian crisis.)\\r\\nThere are hostilities between the Saudis and Emiratis and the Qataris, whom the Saudis and Emiratis have tried to ostracize politically and isolate economically, and between the Saudis and anyone linked to Iran. There is bad blood between Lebanon and Libya. No one has entirely forgotten that Egypt made peace with Israel in 1979, a move seen as such a historic betrayal of the bloc that Egypt was voted out for a decade.\\r\\nAnd when it comes to Syria and the several countries that have funded rebel groups taking on President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government, water is only just beginning to trickle under the bridge.\\r\\nSoon after the Syrian war broke out, the Arab League suspended Syria\u2019s membership, and it later welcomed representatives from the Syrian opposition. Almost eight years later, Mr. Assad has all but re-clinched control of the country.\\r\\nThe league\u2019s membership has had to wrestle with questions about how to rebuild Syria\u2019s shattered infrastructure and economy \u2014 an undertaking that could cost hundreds of billions of dollars \u2014 and what to do about the more than five million refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq.\\r\\nThose questions were always going to be extra-fraught at a summit meeting in Lebanon, where the three major political and religious camps \u2014 Christian, Shiite Muslim and Sunni Muslim \u2014 have been so deadlocked, in part over Lebanese-Syrian relations, that they have failed to form a government for eight months and counting.\\r\\nMr. Assad\u2019s government enjoys the support of Shiite-dominated factions in Lebanon and beyond, and in the weeks before the summit, Lebanon\u2019s Parliament speaker, Nabih Berri, a Shiite, called for the whole event to be postponed until Syria was invited. What was the point of discussing Syrian reconstruction and refugees, Mr. Berri asked, if Syria was absent?\\r\\nHe earned nothing but irritated shushings from Lebanon\u2019s Christian president and Sunni prime minister, who were anxious to present the host country in a good light.\\r\\nThere was not much either the president or prime minister could do, however, about the supporters of Mr. Berri\u2019s party, Amal, who threatened to block the Libyans at the airport if they tried to fly in, and then burned a Libyan flag for good measure.\\r\\nThe flag-burners were aggrieved about a four-decade-old incident in which a revered Lebanese Shiite leader, Musa al-Sadr, disappeared on a trip to see Libya\u2019s leader, Col. Muammar al-Qaddafi. Mr. Qaddafi was killed in the 2011 Libyan uprising, but Lebanese Shiites say Libya\u2019s current government could do more to investigate Mr. Sadr\u2019s disappearance.\\r\\nPerhaps understandably, Libya soon announced that it would decline to attend. One by one, the Arab presidents and kings also sent their regrets, until only the presidents of Mauritania and Somalia remained on the guest list. Then the Somali leader canceled. (A leaders\u2019 summit is held each year, but the economic and social development conference that Beirut was hosting takes place only periodically.)\\r\\nWhen the league\u2019s assistant secretary-general, Hussam Zaki, landed in Beirut to oversee preparations for the summit, he had a gravity-defying message: \u201cThe summit is on schedule,\u201d he said. \u201cThe internal political problems in Lebanon have nothing to do with the Arab League.\u201d\\r\\nMaybe not, but many Lebanese, from the president on down, had hoped that the league would help fix Lebanon\u2019s problems.\\r\\nThe Lebanese wanted Lebanon\u2019s Syrian refugees to go home. They wanted investment in Lebanon\u2019s gasping economy. They definitely did not want the military to shut down half the airport highway as delegations arrived on Saturday, leaving the road so congested that some people were reduced to getting out of their cars and dragging their suitcases the last half-mile to the terminal.\\r\\n\u201cThis summit cost Lebanon millions of dollars \u2014 what are we going to get from it?\u201d Mohamed Al Mawla, an athletic trainer from Beirut, said on Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be ink on paper. Nothing will happen.\u201d\\r\\nIn the end, the Arab leaders left without addressing the major issues at hand, promising merely to establish a regional fund to invest in technology and to support the youth of the Middle East.\\r\\nBut if the meeting did not provide much in the way of solutions, it was rich in wishful thinking. As the oratory flowed on Sunday, a rumor spread that the emir of Qatar, a major regional figure, had not only flown in on his private plane that morning but also announced that he was going to cover the entire $10 million cost of the summit and throw Lebanon an extra $1 billion \u2014 news tailor made to perk up every gloomy skeptic.\\r\\nSoon came the cold water and the official denials: There had been no such princely largess, and the emir was nowhere to be seen, the emir having left after a brief stop in Beirut on Sunday morning. Lebanon would pay. The flags came down, the delegates went home; the circumstance was over and the pomp, until the next summit, was put away.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":61844389,\"description\":\"The red carpet was there as the Arab League held its fourth economic and social summit.

They said that the missile had endangered a ski resort and other areas where civilians were present, but that it had been successfully intercepted by Israel\u2019s air defenses.\\r\\nThe Iranian missile, in turn, was fired shortly after a strike against a weapons store in Syria, for which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel strongly hinted that his country was responsible.\\r\\nIsrael\u2019s acknowledgment of its strikes reflect a shift in policy, with the country increasingly taking responsibility for specific attacks in Syrian territory after years of ambiguity.\\r\\nEight days earlier, Mr. Netanyahu said that Israeli forces had recently attacked Iranian weapons depots in Syria. Iran and Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Lebanese militia, are sworn enemies of Israel and have been crucial allies of the Syrian ruler, Bashar al-Assad, in his country\u2019s long and devastating civil war.\\r\\nAnalysts have warned that Israel\u2019s new openness could ratchet up tensions, making it harder for Iranian leaders to ignore attacks and pushing them to retaliate.\\r\\nIsrael\u2019s lifting of the veil on its fight against Iran in Syria came during a changeover of military chiefs of staff, and as Mr. Netanyahu is campaigning for re-election under a cloud of corruption investigations.\\r\\n\u201cLast night, the air force strongly attacked Iranian targets in Syria after Iran launched a missile from there at our territory,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said on Monday. \u201cWe will not ignore such acts of aggression as Iran attempts to entrench itself militarily in Syria.\u201d\\r\\nHe specifically noted comments on Monday by the Iranian Air Force commander, Aziz Nassirzadeh, though they differed little from countless previous Iranian threats against Israel.\\r\\nIran\u2019s \u201ccurrent and future generations are ready, impatiently, and with every fiber of their being, for battle with the Zionist regime and to wipe it off the face of the earth,\u201d Mr. Nassirzadeh told the Young Journalists Club, a hard-line Iranian news outlet.\\r\\nA hard-line Iranian news website, Tabnak, said that Iran and Israel were heading toward a dangerous confrontation over Syria, adding that Israel had recently changed what it called the unwritten rules of the conflict.\\r\\nThe Israeli military said the overnight targets included sites in Syria of the Iranian Quds Force, the branch of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps that is responsible for foreign operations, as well as a large weapons storage facility in the Damascus International Airport, an Iranian intelligence site and an Iranian military training camp.\\r\\n\u201cWe see a clear presence of Quds forces in Damascus International Airport, inside Syrian army bases and even Quds Force buildings right next to Syrian armed forces, which is a liability to the Syrian regime and its armed forces,\u201d Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesman, told reporters on Monday.\\r\\nColonel Conricus said Syria had ignored Israeli warnings to keep out of the hostilities overnight, firing dozens of surface-to-air missiles. In response, he said, Israel conducted three sorties and attacked several Syrian antiaircraft batteries.\\r\\n\u201cIran is exploiting Syria,\u201d Colonel Conricus said, adding, \u201cSyria paid a price for allowing Iran to conduct attacks from its soil.\u201d\\r\\nHe described the Iranian missile attack as \u201cpremeditated,\u201d and said it had been launched from an area in Syria that Israel had been promised would be free of Iranian forces. He refused to say who had made that promise.\\r\\nThe Israeli military was on an elevated level of alert on Monday and the popular ski site, on Mount Hermon, was closed for the day as a precaution.\\r\\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said in a Twitter post that Israel had destroyed warehouses and sites of the Iranians, Hezbollah, and the Syrian military and killed 11 fighters, without specifying their nationality.\\r\\nThe Syrian state news media said that Syria\u2019s air defenses downed most of the Israeli missiles before they reached their targets. The Defense Ministry of Russia, another country fighting for the Syrian government, said the Israeli strikes had killed four Syrian soldiers and asserted that Syrian forces had intercepted 30 Israeli missiles since Sunday.\\r\\nRussia supplied Syria with the sophisticated S-300 ground-to-air missile system after a Russian military plane was shot down over Syria in September, killing 15 Russian service members. Syrian forces shot the plane down accidentally, trying to hit an Israeli jet after an Israeli airstrike, and Russian officials blamed Israel.\\r\\nBut Israel and Russia have a system for communicating with each other to avoid accidental clashes in Syria. Colonel Conricus said the mechanism was being \u201chonored by both sides and continues as we speak,\u201d and that it was used overnight.\\r\\n\u201cThe Russians are dancing at every wedding possible,\u201d wrote Alex Fishman, a military affairs analyst, in the Monday issue of Yediot Ahronot, an Israeli newspaper. \u201cOn the one hand, they\u2019ve allowed Israel to continue to bomb while, on the other, trying to interfere with the Israeli air force\u2019s ability to do so.\u201d\\r\\nIsraeli officials have acknowledged carrying out hundreds of strikes against weapons convoys and Iranian targets in Syria, but had previously avoided confirming responsibility for specific attacks immediately after they took place in an effort to deter retaliation.\\r\\nBut soon after Sunday\u2019s strike against a weapons store in Damascus, Mr. Netanyahu, who was visiting Chad, said, \u201cWe have a permanent policy, to strike at the Iranian entrenchment in Syria and hurt whoever tries to hurt us.\u201d\\r\\nDuring the visit to Chad, the first by an Israeli prime minister in decades, the two countries announced a resumption of diplomatic relations.\\r\\nMany Israelis have questioned the motives of Mr. Netanyahu and the military for lifting some of the secrecy from Israeli strikes in Syria.\\r\\nYaakov Amidror, a former Israeli national security adviser, said he did not know if it was spurred by the departing military chief of staff\u2019s desire to sum up his four-year term, if it was meant as a signal to the Iranians that Israel is ready to take more risks to restrain Iran in Syria, \u201cor a combination of both.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cIf you want to make clear to the other side that you are determined to prevent something, either you escalate the operation,\u201d Mr. Amidror said, \u201cor you say in public I\u2019m doing it, meaning I\u2019m ready to take the risk.

In one case, it was an airplane day trip and train ride just to meet the man. \\r\\nMany others never met him, but remember the moment his investment and life philosophies  clicked, and suddenly thrust their minds into focus.\\r\\nWhen Mr. Bogle, the Vanguard founder who popularized the low-cost index mutual fund and helped put billions more dollars in the pockets of millions of people, died on Wednesday at the age of 89, he inspired an outpouring of memories.\\r\\nThese are the stories of those who learned from Mr. Bogle, a man so many knew simply as Jack \u2014 no last name required.\\r\\n\\r\\nForthright Humility\\r\\nWe may never know how many people were able to leave the full-time work force early after following Mr. Bogle\u2019s instructions, but Christopher DeMers was one of them.\\r\\nHis salary from working in marketing for Intel and good savings habits helped him retire at 51, but so did a big pivot he made years earlier. After encountering Mr. Bogle\u2019s writing, he went from having all of his money in a single, actively managed mutual fund to diversifying his holdings among many Vanguard index funds. \\r\\nHaving worked in technology as that industry\u2019s stocks climbed skyward in the 1990s, Mr. DeMers could have easily talked himself into the delusion that he had some special insight. But he resisted the urge, as Mr. Bogle counseled investors who thought they could outsmart Wall Street. \\r\\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Mr. DeMers, 63, said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to beat the market in the long run.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nCustomer Supremacy\\r\\nMellody Hobson was a young executive at the mutual fund company Ariel Investments when her boss, John Rogers, took her on a field trip. They hopped a flight from Chicago to New York, then made their way to the train station to catch John Bogle during the only time he had to spare: a train ride to Philadelphia.\\r\\nThen Mr. Rogers hit Mr. Bogle with his opening line: He really wanted Ms. Hobson to meet a legend like Mr. Bogle because she was going to be president of Ariel by the time she was 30. \\r\\nShe was taken aback \u2014 it was the first she\u2019d heard such a forecast. (It actually took her until she was 31.) \\r\\nAs they chugged through New Jersey, Ms. Hobson came face to face with a financial legend \u2014 if nominal competitor \u2014 who didn\u2019t care about his own bottom line. \\r\\n\u201cWhat I felt most of all was that his overriding North Star was caring about the customer,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd wanting what is best for the customer, that\u2019s what I wanted for Ariel clients.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nPatient Realism\\r\\nHarold Evensky was an early recruit in the growing army of financial planners and investment advisers who make money only through the fees that clients pay them directly, no commissions or kickbacks. Many adopted the Vanguard style of investing \u2014 low investment costs and simple index funds.\\r\\nThat philosophy leads to interesting conversations.\\r\\n\u201cOccasionally, an investor will say, \u2018I need X percent return to meet my goals,\u2019\u201d Mr. Evensky said. \u201cWhile that may be a true statement, market returns will be what they are, not what an investor may believe they need. Jack always reminded us that we needed to be realistic in our expectations.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Evensky, who met Mr. Bogle several times over the years, spoke to us via email because he was on a cruise ship between Los Angeles and Honolulu. He could afford the trip, he said, in part because of the long-term planning that Mr. Bogle helped inspire.\\r\\n\\r\\nLow Fees (Like, Really Low)\\r\\nJonathan Clements, who spent two decades at The Wall Street Journal preaching the virtues of low-cost investing, said that it was easy to forget Vanguard\u2019s innovation came in two parts.\\r\\nThe first is obvious: Vanguard customers paid less to own their investments than customers at other mutual funds. But people miss the second part: Mr. Bogle set Vanguard up so the company was owned by its funds, which were owned by their shareholders. That kept it from needing to raise fees to satisfy an aggressive profit target.\\r\\n\u201cIt was a competitive advantage that nobody else could match,\u201d said Mr. Clements, who met Mr. Bogle perhaps 20 times over the years.\\r\\nAnd those low fees added up to bigger gains. \\r\\n\u201cJack fought that battle for decades and decades,\u201d said Mr. Clements, the author of \u201cFrom Here to Financial Happiness\u201d and editor of humbledollar.com. \u201cAnd lesser mortals would have given up far earlier\\r\\nTrue Confidence \\r\\nBarbara Roper, the director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America, said Mr. Bogle didn\u2019t just bring low-cost investments to the average person \u2014 he ran Vanguard for the benefit of investors.\\r\\n\u201cThere has been thinly veiled resentment toward Bogle from other mutual fund leaders over the years because of his focus on reducing costs, which was a direct threat to their bottom line,\u201d said Ms. Roper, who met him once, when she was seated next to him at a dinner. \u201cHe always cared more about that vision \u2014 how the industry should be run \u2014 than making friends in the industry. Of course, he was rewarded with a following that was cultlike in its devotion.\u201d\\r\\nThe cultists call themselves the Bogleheads, a group of like-minded investors who consider Mr. Bogle the spiritual leader of their financial lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoral Compass\\r\\nEach year, the Bogleheads hold a conference. And Christine Benz, the director of personal finance at Morningstar, has interviewed him at each one for the past decade. She called him the conscience of the financial services industry.\\r\\n\u201cHis consistent belief that all investors deserve a fair shake was a core principle that I incorporated into my work and shaped my career path,\u201d she said. \u201cYou listen to Jack Bogle and you think, \u2018I want to be on this guy\u2019s team.\u2019 Whatever he is talking about, this is the right thing to do for people.\u201d\\r\\nSo strong was Mr. Bogle\u2019s belief, she said, that it remained firmly instilled in Vanguard long after he had given up control. And once investors convert to his ethos of simplicity and thrift, it\u2019s for life. \\r\\n\u201cInvestors come around to Vanguard, and then they never leave,\u201d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nEntrepreneurial Influence\\r\\nJon Stein met Mr. Bogle roughly a decade ago, as a student at Columbia Business School beginning to plot what would become Betterment, a robo-adviser that builds portfolios for customers.\\r\\nMr. Bogle was on campus to promote a book, and Mr. Stein stood in line for 20 minutes to have his copy signed. Mr. Stein seized the chance to share his best pitch for Betterment, which, in his eyes, would augment Mr. Bogle\u2019s favored index investments with low-cost, automated portfolio advice.\\r\\nMr. Bogle listened and told Mr. Stein he would help a lot of people. Inside the book, Mr. Bogle wrote, \u201cStay the course!\u201d\\r\\n\u201cHe could have written that in everyone\u2019s book,\u201d said Mr. Stein, chief executive of Betterment, which opened to customers in 2010. \u201cBut when he wrote it to me, it meant that we were onto something.\u201d\\r\\nThey met again years later at Mr. Bogle\u2019s invitation. Mr. Stein arrived at what looked like a professorial grandparent\u2019s study, and was shocked at how much Mr. Bogle had prepared for their meeting, marking up a stack of materials about Betterment.\\r\\n\u201cWe are standing on the shoulders of Jack,\u201d Mr. Stein said. \u201cWe would not be here, Betterment would not exist, without his example with the business he started.\u201d\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\nUnapologetic Boldness\\r\\nWhen Ramit Sethi won a pile of scholarship money for college, he invested some of it in the stock market. He lost big, so he began to learn.\\r\\n\u201cGoing through Wall Street is like playing a video game on the hardest level,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone is out to get you, and you don\u2019t even understand it.\u201d\\r\\nHe soon stumbled on the writings and speeches of Mr. Bogle. \u201cHe spoke in a very plain way,\u201d Mr. Sethi said. \u201cAnd it was heresy what he was saying, while having the courage to go up against a multibillion-dollar industry.\u201d\\r\\nWhen Mr. Sethi decided to make a career in advice about the psychology of money and career strategies, he began with his own bold promise in the title of his first book: \u201cI Will Teach You to Be Rich.\u201d \\r\\n\u201cI came out swinging,\u201d he said. \\r\\nIt was a New York Times best-seller. And on his book tour, Mr. Bogle received him in his office.\\r\\n\\r\\nPriceless Simplicity\\r\\nCarl Richards writes the Sketch Guy column for The New York Times. He never met Mr. Bogle, but found inspiration in his life\u2019s work. He offered this sketch, and the words below.\\r\\nMaking something simple sounds easy. Turns out it\u2019s not.\\r\\nThe world is full of simple hacks that are not even worth the hashtag often applied to them, but the real priceless jewels of simplicity, as Mr. Bogle once put it, are uncovered only after toiling about in the maddening nuance of complexity.\\r\\nYou consider your options. Listen to counterarguments. Push some edges.\\r\\nMy job is to find those jewels of simplicity and share them as sketches. Every once in a while, I get it right. And when I do it\u2019s because John Bogle, he of the elegant and downright simple index fund, gave me permission. I just have to do the work of cutting through the complexity first. \\r\\nRecognizing Enough\\r\\nThe ethos of the financial services industry was far different when Manisha Thakor began her career 25 years ago. \u201cThe drumbeat on Wall Street was Gordon Gekko\u2019s painfully memorable mantra of \u2018Greed is good,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Thakor, now vice president of financial wellbeing at Brighton Jones, a wealth management firm. \u201c\u2018More\u2019 was the word of the decade.\u201d \\r\\nAnd the most powerful lesson she may have learned from Mr. Bogle \u2014 whom she had heard speak at a variety of events over the years \u2014 was the concept of \u201cenough.\u201d \\r\\n\u201cEnough\u201d was also the title of one of his books, her personal favorite, and the idea underpinning Mr. Bogle\u2019s financial and personal way of life.\\r\\nShe called indexing the financial manifestation of the idea. \u201cIt\u2019s the notion that accepting your fair share of the market\u2019s return over the long run will do you just fine,\u201d she said.\\r\\nBut \u201cenough\u201d was also the mark of man who worked for the benefit of others, rather than himself. \\r\\n\u201cWhat is often missed when speaking about Jack\u2019s legacy,\u201d she said, \u201cis the way in which this concept of \u2018enough\u2019 also shaped his outlook on the way to live a life of meaning, rooted in character.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1643557620,\"description\":\"Personal finance luminaries and everyday investors share lessons from the late Vanguard

insidious scourge that has nothing to do with head trauma is ravaging retired N.F.L. players.\\r\\nIn the past few decades, the N.F.L.\u2019s emphasis on the passing game and quarterback protection has led teams to stock their offensive and defensive lines with ever-larger men, many of them weighing well over 300 pounds. But their great girth, which coaches encouraged and which helped turn some players into multimillion-dollar commodities, leaves many of them prone to obesity problems.\\r\\nIn retirement, these huge men are often unable to lose the weight they needed to do their jobs. Without the structure of a team and the guidance of coaches for the first time in decades, many of them lose the motivation to stay in shape, or cannot even try, as damage to their feet, knees, backs and shoulders limits their ability to exercise. \\r\\nThis is a big reason that former linemen, compared with other football players and the general population, have higher rates of hypertension, obesity and sleep apnea, which can lead to chronic fatigue, poor diet and even death. Blocking for a $25-million-a-year quarterback, it turns out, can put linemen in the high-risk category for many of the ailments health experts readily encourage people to avoid. \\r\\n\u201cLinemen are bigger, and in today\u2019s world, rightly or wrongly, they are told to bulk up,\u201d said Henry Buchwald, a specialist in bariatric surgery at the University of Minnesota who works with the Living Heart Foundation, a nonprofit organization that provides free medical tests to former N.F.L. players. \u201cTheir eating habits are hard to shed when they stop playing, and when they get obese, they get exposed to diabetes, hypertension and cardiac problems.\u201d\\r\\nMany linemen say they were encouraged by their high school and college coaches to gain weight to win scholarships and to be drafted by the N.F.L., where a lot of players were required to become even bigger. In some cases, players were converted from tight ends to down linemen, and needed extra weight to play the new position. Coaches often leave it up to the players to decide how to gain weight. \\r\\nJoe Thomas, an All-Pro lineman with the Cleveland Browns, said that as a freshman in college he ate every few hours to gain the 40 pounds he needed to get to 290 pounds. He gobbled burgers, frozen pizzas and large bowls of ice cream. \u201cIt was see food, eat food,\u201d Thomas said.\\r\\nThe Living Heart Foundation has examined several thousand former players since it was formed in 2001 with financial backing from the N.F.L. players\u2019 union. About two-thirds of those players \u2014 not just linemen \u2014 had a body mass index above 30, which is considered moderately obese. A third of those screened were at 35 or above, or significantly obese. The index, which is viewed as a general indication of weight relative to size, does not take into account muscle mass. \\r\\nLinemen have been getting heavier, faster. From 1942 to 2011, they have gained an average of three-quarters of a pound to two pounds a year, about twice the average gain for all N.F.L. players, according to a study published in The Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research.\\r\\nAnother study showed that the average weight of offensive linemen ballooned 27 percent, from 249 pounds in the 1970s to 315 pounds in the 2000s, as the passing game evolved. \\r\\nThe consequences can be dire. A study published in The American Journal of Medicine found that for every 10 pounds football players gained from high school to college, or from college to the professional level, the risk of heart disease rose 14 percent compared with players whose weight changed little during the same period.\\r\\nPlenty of linemen do lose weight. The former linemen Matt Birk and Nick Hardwick shed dozens of pounds after retiring and publicized their achievement. Thomas, who retired last year after 11 seasons with the Browns, gained roughly 30 pounds after entering the N.F.L. He has since lost about 50 pounds by eating less and eating healthier.\\r\\n\u201cI reversed everything I was doing,\u201d said Thomas, who weighed about 320 pounds in the N.F.L. \u201cNo more freezer pizzas before bed. I dialed back the carbs, added whole grains, couscous, quinoa.\u201d\\r\\nThe N.F.L. and the players\u2019 union, recognizing more must be done, offer retired players medical exams, health club memberships and other services. Dozens of retired players, for instance, get free health screenings at the Super Bowl.\\r\\nStill, many players are unreachable, said Archie Roberts, a former N.F.L. quarterback and retired heart surgeon who started the Living Heart Foundation. \u201cIf you don\u2019t guide players through it, they won\u2019t show up. If we can\u2019t get them to follow through, they won\u2019t get the health care they deserve.\u201d\\r\\nDerek Kennard: Sleep Apnea\\r\\nMany former linemen said they woke to the dangers of being obese when the Hall of Famer Reggie White died in 2004 of cardiac arrhythmia. White also had sleep apnea.\\r\\nLinemen are prone to the affliction, in which a person\u2019s breathing repeatedly stops and starts because the muscles in their neck press against the breathing passage as they sleep. This cuts off the flow of oxygen and wakes the player, often for a second or two. The continual sleep interruptions can make it difficult for those with sleep apnea to feel fully rested.\\r\\nFormer linemen have big necks, and as they age their throat tissue becomes flabby, so their tongues can block their airways, said Anthony Scianni, a dentist who runs the Center for Dental Sleep Medicine, which works with former N.F.L. players.\\r\\nThe lack of oxygen, Scianni said, stimulates the body to produce more sugars, which can cause Type 2 diabetes and lead to overeating and other problems.\\r\\nDerek Kennard, a guard for 11 seasons with the Cardinals, the Saints and the Cowboys, has battled to reverse this cycle. He snored so loudly \u2014 a common symptom of sleep apnea \u2014 that his roommate in his last season asked for a different room. After Kennard retired in 1996, the years of sleep deprivation led to other problems. He ate poorly and gained 100 pounds. He took Vicodin to deal with the pain of his football injuries. The pain, lack of sleep and extra weight made it difficult to exercise. His cholesterol levels and blood pressure jumped. He would fall asleep behind the wheel while stopped at traffic lights.\\r\\n\u201cYou\u2019re not sleeping well, so your body is not healing itself,\u201d said Kennard, whose son Devon is a linebacker for the Lions. \\r\\nAfter his brother died in 2009, Kennard, who is 6-foot-3 and whose weight peaked at 465 pounds, sought help. He was tested for sleep apnea and was told he woke 77 times per hour. One episode of not breathing lasted 1 minute 32 seconds. Because he flips in bed as he sleeps, Kennard had trouble wearing the mask of a CPAP machine, which delivers continuous positive airway pressure and is the standard treatment for sleep apnea. He switched to a mouthpiece that kept his airways open. He now wakes just twice an hour, and sleeps about seven hours a night. His weight fell to about 350 pounds, and he stopped taking painkillers.\\r\\n\u201cA hundred pounds came off quickly because I had energy to do exercise,\u201d he said at a conference for retired players in Phoenix, where he lives. \\r\\nKennard urges other former players to be checked for sleep apnea, and tries to convince them that wearing a mask does not make them weak.\\r\\n\u201cI had so much death in my life, I could see it in front of me,\u201d he said.\\r\\nVaughn Parker: Overeating, a Constant Battle\\r\\nVaughn Parker, a tackle who played 11 years, mostly with the Chargers, struggled with overeating, and after a dozen surgeries on his shoulders, ankles and triceps, he had a hard time exercising to shed weight. \\r\\nHe also got busy. Parker invested in real estate in San Diego until the market collapsed in 2008. He had two children, split with his wife and studied for an M.B.A., which he finished in May 2017. The stress led him to eat more, and before he knew it, he had added 90 pounds to his 6-foot-3 frame and weighed more than 400 pounds. \\r\\n\u201cEveryone has their cross to bear,\u201d said Parker, 47, who also has high blood pressure. \u201cFor some people, it\u2019s gambling or alcohol. For me, it\u2019s food.\u201d\\r\\nIn 2013, Parker received a phone call from Aaron Taylor, a former teammate, who encouraged him to work out with other retired N.F.L. players who received free gym memberships from the Trust, a group started by the N.F.L. and the players\u2019 union to assist retirees.\\r\\nParker started driving 40 minutes to Carlsbad, north of San Diego, several times a week to EXOS, a high-end fitness club, where a trainer tailored workouts to his abilities and injuries. Afterward, the handful of former players discussed their progress and drank nutritional shakes. They learned about portion control and shopping for healthy food. Parker knew he had lost his best chance to become fit, which is right after retirement, but he tried to catch up.\\r\\n His workouts were exhausting, but he stuck with the program, in part driven by the camaraderie of the other ex-players, and shed nearly 100 pounds the first year. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a day I didn\u2019t sit at the edge of my bed and say I\u2019m not going today,\u201d Parker said. \\r\\nKeeping the weight off has been a challenge. At home, he drinks protein shakes and eats made-to-order meals. But he also likes sugary drinks, and eating healthily on business trips has been tough. When he dines out with friends, he eats nachos, chicken wings and fried foods.\\r\\nBut the prospect of cascading health problems motivates Parker to keep exercising. He recently re-enrolled in a six-week training program at EXOS.\\r\\n\u201cHow many 400-pound offensive linemen are walking around in their 50s?\u201d he said.\\r\\nJimmie Giles: Avoiding Surgery, Managing Pain\\r\\nLinemen are not the only players who need to keep the pounds on to play their position. Tight ends and linebackers often do as well.\\r\\nThat was true for Jimmie Giles, who because of his size and soft hands was one of the best blocking tight ends of his day. Nearly 30 years after he retired, Giles, who lives in Tampa, Fla., where he starred for the Buccaneers, checks in at roughly 350 pounds, about 100 pounds above his playing weight.\\r\\nAfter 13 years in the N.F.L., ending in 1989, he had done lasting damage to his back, knees and feet. He had regular headaches, the result of about a dozen concussions. When he retired he took up golf to stay in shape. But the effects of his football injuries added up, limiting his activity. He had four degenerative disks in his back and no feeling in his right leg, and he had sleep apnea. His inability to exercise exacerbated his problems.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I gained 100 pounds right away,\u201d he said.\\r\\nTo relieve the pain in his back, Giles received five epidurals a year, an ordeal he gave up when he started taking painkillers. But they can be highly addictive and caused sluggishness.\\r\\n\u201cThat\u2019s not living \u2014 that\u2019s surviving,\u201d Giles said in his family\u2019s insurance office in Tampa.\\r\\nAbout two years ago, Giles quit taking painkillers. He now receives cortisone shots instead. He said he does not even take aspirin \u201cbecause I want to know when I hurt.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cAs long as I\u2019m at a 5 out of 10 in terms of pain, I\u2019m all right,\u201d he added.\\r\\nGiles, though, has put off back surgery for as long as possible, wary of the side effects. Every six months or so, he also receives radio frequency epidurals to deaden the nerves in his left leg, where he suffers shooting pain. \\r\\nGiles\u2019s father died from a heart attack, and his brother, who had congestive heart failure, is also dead. So Giles, who receives disability benefits from the N.F.L., regularly visits doctors to keep his high blood pressure and other vital signs in check.\\r\\nLosing weight has been difficult. He rode a bicycle until it affected his prostate. Now he swims for an hour several times a week. He tries to eat moderately, and he avoids sweets and breads.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for him,\u201d his wife, Vivian, said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the food \u2014 it\u2019s the injuries.\u201d\\r\\nDavid Lewis: Diabetes, Heart Condition\\r\\nWhen David Lewis played linebacker in the 1970s and early 1980s, he was 6-foot-4 and weighed 236 pounds. Like many other players, he was pushed out of the game by injuries.\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019ve had sprains, broken knuckles, hyperextended elbows, nerve problems in my neck, shoulders,\u201d Lewis, 64, said. \u201cI\u2019d be guessing how much concussions I had.\u201d\\r\\nBy about 40, he was receiving disability payments, and he has qualified for the 88 Plan, a league and union benefit that pays for medical care for players with dementia, including Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s. \\r\\nUnable to run or exert himself much, he now weighs about 300 pounds.\\r\\n\u201cAs time went on, all the sickness started to add up,\u201d he said.\\r\\nThe sickness includes Type 2 diabetes, a kidney ailment and a congested heart from hypertension. He receives iron transfusions to correct a deficiency. He takes a half-dozen pills each day.\\r\\nAside from taking medicine, combating those problems has not been easy. Lewis said he needed a knee replacement which should allow him to exercise more. But he said he could not have the surgery because of his heart condition.\\r\\nHe goes to a Y.M.C.A. to walk on the treadmill and ride a stationary bicycle. He has also tried to eat healthier, like dropping sausages in favor of oatmeal, egg whites and fruit.\\r\\nThis has helped him lose about 30 pounds this year and ease the stress on his knees and back.\\r\\nLewis knows he has to keep moving. Metabolically, the more weight you have, the harder it is to lose weight because the fat cells replicate, said Rudi Ferrate, a doctor who helps players with sleep apnea. \u201cWe\u2019re designed to store energy,\u201d he said.\\r\\nWillie Roaf: Injuries Accumulate\\r\\nWillie Roaf knew it was time to retire in 2005. After 13 years at left tackle with the Saints and the Chiefs, he was destined for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, which he entered in 2012. Many of the 189 games he played were on unforgiving turf, and his body was breaking down.\\r\\nRoaf, 48, tore his hamstring and had back and knee injuries, episodes of gout, a staph infection and periodic lymphatic swelling in his leg. Prediabetic, meaning his blood glucose levels were higher than normal, he was determined to keep his weight down and went to the gym after he retired. He weighed about 320 pounds, similar to during his playing career.\\r\\nBut within a few years, he became less mobile. Doctors told him he had spinal stenosis, a narrowing of the spinal canal. In 2013, a doctor told him he had the back of a 70-year-old. He had surgery to relieve pressure on the sciatic nerves. He wanted to keep the pounds off, but working out was difficult.\\r\\n\u201cI can\u2019t do anything more than stretching,\u201d he said in his Florida kitchen. He takes medicine to prevent gout and to regulate his blood pressure, cholesterol, arthritis and uric acid.\\r\\nHis mobility has increased, and he has returned to the gym, where he does 30 minutes on the treadmill or elliptical machine several times a week. He takes about 7,000 steps a day, which he monitors with a Fitbit. He competes with friends to see who can walk the most. He tries to drink smoothies, eat fewer sweets and take vitamins.\\r\\n\u201cThe more I move around, the better my numbers,\u201d Roaf said. \\r\\nStill, his injuries limit how much he can do, which has made it hard for him to lose 50 pounds to reach his target of 300 pounds.\\r\\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a bad day, I\u2019ll just sit in the recliner and not go anywhere,\u201d he said.\\r\\nAt the end of an hourlong conversation, Roaf\u2019s Fitbit buzzed to remind him to get up and move. He got out of his chair, walked to a couch in the living room and sat again. The gym would have to wait.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-259757828,\"description\":\"The effects of head trauma have gotten much of the attention, but huge weight gains have also damaged N.F.L. retirees.\\r\",\"title\":\"The N.F.L.\u2019s Obesity Scourge\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"health.23.txt\"}],\"labelMap\":[[744716624,\"health\"],[-771583032,\"technology\"],[-753305417,\"world\"],[-1898459496,\"business\"],[1657028483,\"world\"],[-783835124,\"technology\"],[-476441678,\"business\"],[-445713388,\"business\"],[-1490783143,\"world\"],[788528588,\"world\"],[2035964461,\"health\"],[-1414196775,\"technology\"],[-1413757249,\"business\"],[-2063294509,\"business\"],[-430270314,\"health\"],[-1094504659,\"science\"],[1589556157,\"science\"],[-713484201,\"world\"],[1827469542,\"world\"],[-394144843,\"technology\"],[-787975219,\"health\"],[-1525035125,\"technology\"],[-621936301,\"world\"],[-782052188,\"science\"],[857785162,\"science\"],[1261007473,\"health\"],[1446855515,\"world\"],[-1615598764,\"world\"],[-677372880,\"world\"],[-788369064,\"business\"],[-912019104,\"world\"],[-331952209,\"science\"],[1763094825,\"technology\"],[1691764127,\"technology\"],[-1720052767,\"health\"],[-929925753,\"world\"],[189579811,\"business\"],[1023035361,\"health\"],[-1138956957,\"technology\"],[430059624,\"science\"],[-242681196,\"health\"],[772145717,\"technology\"],[-81222030,\"business\"],[-1631127366,\"world\"],[-2008072080,\"technology\"],[996113641,\"world\"],[-621199876,\"business\"],[115072823,\"health\"],[216869378,\"world\"],[979802475,\"technology\"],[951101460,\"business\"],[-259757828,\"health\"],[-1741665359,\"technology\"],[-1896161526,\"business\"],[-204444614,\"world\"],[-275112213,\"world\"],[-113826969,\"technology\"],[1909517249,\"health\"],[-1936711235,\"world\"],[484957069,\"world\"],[-1973712285,\"world\"],[571503521,\"technology\"],[309217200,\"health\"],[1485903018,\"world\"],[1247966159,\"business\"],[-1098402478,\"business\"],[1111125378,\"world\"],[1834607485,\"technology\"],[1398502267,\"business\"],[950150728,\"science\"],[-234580457,\"health\"],[854018702,\"world\"],[-1948748778,\"world\"],[-647669952,\"world\"],[-1170799488,\"health\"],[1305399972,\"business\"],[1308178059,\"business\"],[334877764,\"business\"],[2124488777,\"business\"],[1269534550,\"health\"],[1528840498,\"technology\"],[1903783804,\"science\"],[-1109331175,\"health\"],[-207050379,\"business\"],[-1273329071,\"world\"],[826245742,\"science\"],[922441747,\"business\"],[-1965193406,\"business\"],[-1080452082,\"world\"],[1613553776,\"health\"],[45788846,\"technology\"],[-1854252144,\"technology\"],[1438233615,\"business\"],[1004328290,\"business\"],[-494168399,\"world\"],[1928581844,\"business\"],[61844389,\"world\"],[1823166894,\"world\"],[-1643557620,\"business\"]],\"confusionMatrix\":[[10,1,0,4,5],[1,4,1,0,2],[3,2,3,2,4],[1,0,1,8,2],[7,0,0,1,9]],\"confusionLabels\":[\"business\",\"health\",\"science\",\"technology\",\"world\"],\"relabelingLabelMap\":[[-1413757249,\"business\"],[-783835124,\"technology\"],[-782052188,\"science\"],[2035964461,\"health\"],[744716624,\"health\"],[1589556157,\"science\"],[-1490783143,\"world\"],[-621936301,\"world\"],[-1720052767,\"health\"],[-912019104,\"world\"],[-713484201,\"world\"],[-242681196,\"health\"],[-677372880,\"world\"],[-1094504659,\"science\"],[-331952209,\"science\"],[-430270314,\"health\"],[1909517249,\"health\"],[-113826969,\"technology\"],[772145717,\"technology\"],[-275112213,\"world\"],[1398502267,\"business\"],[334877764,\"business\"],[-1080452082,\"world\"],[1261007473,\"health\"],[-234580457,\"health\"],[-1948748778,\"world\"],[-787975219,\"health\"],[-259757828,\"health\"],[-929925753,\"health\"]],\"accuracy\":0.6060606060606061,\"correctRelabeled\":[-1413757249,-783835124,-782052188,2035964461,744716624,1589556157,-1490783143,-1720052767,-912019104,-1094504659,-331952209,-430270314,1909517249,-275112213,-1080452082,-787975219,-259757828],\"labelingPrecision\":0.6071428571428571,\"labelingRecall\":0.4358974358974359,\"correctAssignedItems\":[-1413757249,-783835124,-782052188,2035964461,744716624,1589556157,-1490783143,-621936301,-1720052767,-912019104,-713484201,-242681196,-1094504659,-331952209,-430270314,1909517249,-113826969,772145717,-275112213,1398502267,334877764,-1080452082,1261007473,-234580457,-787975219,-259757828],\"assignmentPrecision\":0.6071428571428571,\"openedItems\":[],\"numOpenedItems\":0,\"selectedItems\":[],\"selectedInCategory\":0,\"selectionRecall\":null},{\"modelOperation\":\"update\",\"changedFiles\":[{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"To casual observers of either military service or the practice of yoga, the path from Oorah to Om may not seem obvious. But the intersection of yogi and veteran is natural if unexpected, beginning with the five classic yoga poses known as warriors. \\r\\nWhile veterans make up a small percentage of yoga instructors, their ranks are growing. Many members of the military now often include yoga \u2014 sometimes taught by veterans \u2014 as an element of their workout routine, and veterans turn to the practice for therapeutic applications. The Department of Veterans Affairs has successfully used yoga to help treat opioid addiction and post-traumatic stress.\\r\\n\u201cA lot of vets have post-traumatic stress,\u201d said Thierry Chiapello, who served in the Marines and now teaches yoga at the National Defense University in Washington. \u201cBy lengthening the exhalation of breath, this gets people out of those fight-or-flight instincts that drain you,\u201d he continued, putting them in a mode of \u201crest and recovery that definitely is associated with less aggressive behaviors.\u201d\\r\\nVeterans, long schooled in discipline and concentration, also make excellent yoga teachers, both to other veterans, whose experiences they understand, and to active-duty military members, whose trust they often gain. They are becoming a welcome addition in civilian yoga studios, where students are usually attracted to their compassionate yet frequently no-nonsense approach. \\r\\nHere are some veterans who have become yoga teachers \u2014 from various service branches, eras and parts of the country \u2014 reflecting on the transition.\\r\\nHuntington Beach, Calif.\\r\\nChristian Allaire \\r\\n \u201cThere are huge synergies with the military and yoga,\u201d said Mr. Allaire, who discovered this as he learned yoga. \u201cThere is a stereotype that yogis are a bunch of hippie types of people who are not militaristic,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the whole system of yoga is about moral and ethical restraints on behavior and trying to stay calm in challenging conditions. Sometimes in a pose you feel pain and you have to say, \u2018Is that pain that is damaging or is that discomfort that I need to lean into?\u2019\u201d\\r\\nMr. Allaire teaches hot yoga, a power-driven practice that is popular with veterans because of its athletic nature, and his background shows in how he teaches. \u201cYour commanding officer is your breath,\u201d he said during a recent class in Huntington Beach.\\r\\n\u201cI don't do a lot of chanting,\u201d he said, acknowledging his special style. \u201cI step into class and say, \u2018O.K., folks, get into child\u2019s pose.\u2019 I believe this to be a discipline. Coming in late is not cool and not being serious about your practice is not cool.\u201d\\r\\nHe noted that yoga could benefit people on active duty. \u201cIn order to be skilled at a firearm, you have to be able to control your breathing,\u201d he said. \u201cSpecial Forces people train in breathing techniques all the time. That is one little thing that no one would ever connect.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Allaire experiences the service-driven life of yoga through his work for the Veterans Yoga Project, which provides yoga to roughly 1,000 veterans and their families per week as well as trains prospective teachers. \u201cWe will have four or five people in a conference room at a V.A.,\u201d he said. \u201cThere might be an Iraq war vet in his 20s, a Korean War vet in his 80s, some can barely move, some may be missing limbs and the teacher\u2019s job is to create space for a person to do a twist. Maybe all they can do is raise their hands above their heads, but we are creating a ritual.\u201d\\r\\nBloomfield, Conn.\\r\\nMichael Riley\\r\\n\u201cI teach veteran culture to civilian yoga teachers, which is important,\u201d Mr. Riley said. \u201cWith the V.A. accepting yoga as one of the methods for traumatic brain injuries or PTSD, there are more traditional yoga teachers coming in contact with veterans who may not understand the culture, and there can be some triggering. If I was to describe the average veteran, they are so stuck in their body that they are not really breathing. We teach them to breathe more deeply in their body.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Riley notes that teaching veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder requires precautions. \u201cFor instance, I teach with my back to the door,\u201d he said. \u201cBy allowing veterans to see the door, it gives them a little more ease in their body.\u201d\\r\\nHe added: \u201cAs I move, I try not to move too much. I don\u2019t do a lot of hands-on adjustments. There is a space with vets that I don\u2019t violate. I don\u2019t get too close sometimes, I allow them to feel what is coming up and sometimes it doesn\u2019t feel good and that\u2019s O.K. It is difficult, but you have to sit with it if you really want to heal. You want to just hold space and be able to recognize what is coming up in the moment and see what is my next move. \u201d\\r\\nLike many veteran yogis, he practiced what he now preaches. \u201cWhat I bring when I teach veterans is not just my yoga journey, but how I have been able to weave in other support techniques,\u201d he said. \u201cI have been done great with it. I know it works. Since 2012 when I went to the V.A. and started practicing yoga, my relationship with my children has improved tremendously. But, he noted, \u201cIt hasn\u2019t helped much with my relationships with my exes.\\\"\\r\\nCorpus Christi, TEX.\\r\\nLiz Corwin \\r\\n\u201cI found yoga in flight school in Meridian, Miss.\u201d Ms. Corwin said. \u201cThere was one yoga studio. This is when I found it was such an escape for me because flight school is so intense and they are critiquing everything you do. Nobody knew who I was and nobody cared who I was. I disappeared.\u201d\\r\\nSo what is the difference between teaching yoga to civilians and to active-military members and veterans?\\r\\n \u201cIn the studio I am a bit more esoteric,\u201d she said. \u201cI use a bit more flowy words.\u201d But being a veteran, she added, \u201cabsolutely adds a legitimacy in a competitive, stressful, critical world. They say, \u2018If she can learn to turn her brain off from all the spinning I can, too.\u2019\u201d \\r\\nMs. Corwin\u2019s work taps into the military-civilian divide in the United States. \\r\\n\u201cThe hard thing about teaching in the military \u2014 there is very much either you\u2019re in the military or you\u2019re a civilian,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is really hard as a yoga teacher who hasn\u2019t been in the military to step into that community and immediately garner the trust. When I teach the military, I teach a pretty power-focused class. I tend to hold poses longer and talk more specifically. They tend to like the direction \u2014 there is a sense of safety in the authority that they are used to. But I introduce a playfulness; I curse. I keep it real.\u201d\\r\\nSometimes people are skeptical at first, especially about yoga\u2019s ability to offer the intensity that military workouts entail. \u201cYou invite some humor in and give them something to find their edge with,\u201d Ms. Corwin said. \u201cWithin that community, I can use that different voice. With a bunch of PTSD vets, you wouldn\u2019t take them to those places. My entire intention is how do I get them to walk back into a yoga studio.\u201d\\r\\nNot everyone can get past the perception of yoga, of course. One guy simply had to call it \u201ccombat stretch.\u201d\\r\\nCypress, Tex.\\r\\nAndy Johnson\\r\\nA veteran himself, Mr. Johnson recognizes patterns with yogis, especially men, that he tries to address. \u201cWhat veterans try to do is pull themselves through the practice. It\u2019s the opposite of what you should be doing. I try to really focus on the breathing what would happen if you just let gravity take over,\u201d he explained\\r\\n\u201cMy passion is getting men into yoga and trying to get them connected to themselves, the pain they are feeling and the things they need to let go. It is incredible to see people learn that it is not about getting into the pose,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cSoldiers are very good at being in the moment, much better than I have seen with a lot of civilian yogis. But what I am learning is that it doesn\u2019t matter if you are a former military vet who served four terms in Iraq or a housewife with four kids and anxiety issues. We approach those issues the same way. You think you have all this control in yoga, but it\u2019s not about the control, it\u2019s about kind of letting go.\u201d\\r\\nThe studio attracts veterans, and sometimes it holds special classes, \u201cWarriors in Poses,\u201d focused on them. \u201cIt is a class for veterans taught by a veteran but opened to the entire community,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cI have been told that it is interesting to see a veteran teaching and I think they do appreciate it. I do bring a different point of view to my practice because we had to endure so much regimentation and structure that now I like to break

Forward, the 121-year-old Jewish publication that started as a Yiddish-language daily newspaper for those who had fled persecution in Europe, announced on Thursday that it planned to stop publishing print editions this spring.\\r\\n\u201cWhereas our readers once went to the newsstand with a nickel to read the news of the day, today, the vast majority of our community connects through the digital world,\u201d the publication said in a note to its readers. \u201cThat is where The Forward is and will be.\u201d\\r\\nIn addition to the move away from print, The Forward cut nearly 30 percent of its staff, including the editor in chief, Jane Eisner, and the executive editor, Dan Friedman.\\r\\n\u201cThe staff here is great, and it was a very difficult decision,\u201d Rachel Fishman Feddersen, the publisher and chief executive of The Forward, said in an interview. \u201cBut my job is to make sure The Forward is here for the next 120 years, and that means having an organization that is focused on digital readership.\u201d\\r\\nOnce known as The Jewish Daily Forward, the publication first put out supplements in English in the 1980s and started a weekly edition in English in 1990. Since 2017, The Forward has been a monthly magazine. It will continue to publish in both languages online after it stops appearing on newsstands.\\r\\nThe Forward reaches more than two million readers a month online, the publisher said. The English print edition has 16,000 subscribers; the Yiddish version has fewer than 1,000.\\r\\nOverseen by the Forward Association, a nonprofit, The Forward has been losing money since 1945, Ms. Feddersen said. Over the last several years, she said, the losses have been \u201cin the millions.\u201d\\r\\nMs. Eisner had been the editor since 2008. Before that she spent 25 years at The Philadelphia Inquirer, working as a reporter and editorial page editor. Under her leadership, The Forward broke several high-profile stories, including a 2017 investigation saying that Sebastian Gorka, a former national security spokesman for the Trump administration, was a member of Vitezi Rend, a Hungarian nationalist group with a history of Nazi collaboration. Ms. Eisner also interviewed President Barack Obama in the Oval Office in 2015.\\r\\n\u201cDuring more than 10 years as editor in chief, I have embraced visionary, fearless and impactful journalism that served our community with distinction,\u201d Ms. Eisner said in a statement. \u201cI was ready to continue to lead The Forward in its next, online phase but the board and publisher chose instead to make substantial personnel changes, including that I will no longer be editor in chief.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cI have cherished my time at The Forward, which has assembled the very best staff in Jewish journalism,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s been an honor to work with them.\u201d\\r\\nThe Forward was co-founded by the Belarus-born writer Abraham Cahan, who served as its editor for 43 years. For many decades, the Nobel Prize-winning author Isaac Bashevis Singer published his short stories and serialized his novels in its pages.\\r\\nThe publication \u201ccame to stand for the idea that the redemption of the Jews could be found in America and the ideas of social democracy. It fell in love with the way its utopian ideas could be pursued in America,\u201d Seth Lipsky, a former editor in chief of The Forward, said in an email.\\r\\nAt its height in the 1920s, the publication had a circulation of more than 250,000, with editions printed around the country. \u201cIt was huge,\u201d said Mr. Lipsky, who wrote \u201cThe Rise of Abraham Cahan\u201d and founded The New York Sun, a New York City daily broadsheet that lasted from 2002 to 2008.\\r\\nMr. Lipsky said he was not worried about The Forward leaving print for something less palpable. \u201cAll of us in one way or another are approaching this rendezvous,\u201d he said.\\r\\nThese days, he added, the manner of publication is not the main thing: \u201cI think the future of the paper will be secured by scoops, rather than the method of delivery.\u201d\\r\\nAt a time when print advertising has decreased and newsstands sell more candy bars and lottery tickets than newspapers, The Forward is not alone in making the shift to a digital-only format. Cond\u00e9 Nast recently put an end to the regular print editions of Glamour, Teen Vogue and Self, and Hearst Magazines made the venerable Seventeen magazine into an online-only publication.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":449058542,\"description\":\"In addition to moving away from newsstands, the publication is laying off roughly 30 percent of its staff, including the editor in chief, Jane Eisner.\\r\",\"title\":\"In Print Since 1897, The Forward Goes Digital Only\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"business.44.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"A branch of Al Qaeda in northwestern Africa claimed responsibility for an attack on a United Nations base in Mali that killed 10 Chadian peacekeepers on Sunday, saying it was in response to Chad\u2019s resumption of diplomatic relations with Israel.\\r\\nIn a statement, the United Nations mission in Mali said that a peacekeeping base had come under attack in the northeastern village of Aguelhok.

In reality, he was a 27-year-old shopkeeper and aspiring model named Naqeebullah Mehsud who was popular on social media, and had no links to militants.\\r\\nThe protests after the killing of Mr. Mehsud, an ethnic Pashtun, mushroomed into a movement in the country\u2019s northwest, which has a majority Pashtun population. The Pashtun Tahafuz Movement, as the campaign is known, has challenged the authorities over abuses, and accused the Pakistani military, especially, of human rights violations, mass killings and extrajudicial abductions.\\r\\nThe Pakistani military has denied the allegations and in recent months has imposed limits on the news coverage of the movement.\\r\\nCommander Rao is facing a Supreme Court-led inquiry, and is free on bail. Despite the arrest, few believe the police in this case or others will be made accountable.\\r\\nSardar Usman Buzdar, the chief minister of Punjab Province, promised justice when he visited the surviving children of the shooting Saturday at the hospital.\\r\\nOn Sunday, the Punjab law minister, Muhammad Basharat Raja, said at a news conference that intelligence agencies said Mr. Javed had had links to the Islamic State, and had been involved in abductions and killings.\\r\\nMr. Raja announced compensation of 20 million Pakistani rupees, or about $143,680, for the survivors of the shooting, and said an investigation would be completed within three days. He said the team that took part in the shooting and its supervisor were in police custody.\\r\\nThe authorities said that another police shooting, on Sunday, had killed two other men, whom they did not identify but said were linked to Mr. Javed. They described the men as terrorists who had been hiding in Mr. Javed\u2019s house in Lahore and escaped after they learned of his killing.\\r\\nThe Pakistani authorities deny that the Islamic State has an organized presence in the country, but several militant networks here have expressed their support for the terrorist group.\\r\\nAs public furor over the police has increased, opposition political parties have sharply criticized Mr. Khan\u2019s government.

He was 66.\\r\\nHis wife, the writer Deborah Davis, said that the cause was respiratory failure and that Mr. Urman had recently learned he had bone cancer.\\r\\nMr. Urman was an important part of two distribution companies that focused on independent films: ThinkFilm, which was founded in 2001 and essentially shuttered in 2008, and Paladin, which he founded in 2009.\\r\\nA distributor\u2019s job is to market movies and place them in theaters. What distinguished Mr. Urman was his devotion to independent movies that can hardly compete with Hollywood blockbusters; he had to persuade moviegoers and theater owners to choose films with subjects that were unfamiliar and, at times, seemingly unappealing.\\r\\nThe challenges facing independent distributors have become more pronounced in recent years as the number of small films produced annually has spiked and the number of distributors to place them has declined.\\r\\nWith more independent movies vying to be shown in the same number of art-house theaters, they are getting less screen time, making it much harder for them to develop an audience through word of mouth or critical acclaim.\\r\\nMr. Urman helped draw attention to films through creative promotional tie-ins and release schedules, sometimes arranging for openings in cities off the beaten paths of New York and Los Angeles.\\r\\nSome of his greatest successes were with nonfiction films. He distributed two Academy Award-winning documentary features: \u201cBorn Into Brothels\u201d (2005), Ross Kaufman and Zana Briski\u2019s look at children growing up in Kolkata\u2019s red-light district, and \u201cTaxi to the Dark Side\u201d (2007), Alex Gibney\u2019s examination of United States policies on torture as told through the story of an Afghan taxi driver who died in American custody at Bagram Airfield in 2002.\\r\\nAnother success was \u201cHalf-Nelson\u201d (2006), the story of a crack-addicted history teacher in Brooklyn, directed by Ryan Fleck, written by Mr. Fleck and Anna Boden, and starring a young Ryan Gosling as the teacher. The film\u2019s complex characters, political undertones and stark depiction of addiction scared away many distributors.\\r\\nMr. Urman pushed \u201cHalf-Nelson\u201d hard, sending out screener DVDs well in advance of awards season and enlisting a prominent publicist to alert critics and Motion Picture Academy members. Mr. Gosling was nominated for an Academy Award for best actor, and Mr. Urman told The New York Times\u2019s Carpetbagger blog in 2007 that he saw the nomination as vindication.\\r\\n\u201cWe needed to prove to the industry that we\u2019re real,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of actors make indie movies for prestige, not just money, to prove their chops.

His parents were Jewish Holocaust survivors who made their way to the United States from Poland after World War II.\\r\\nThe family moved to Brooklyn, and Mr. Urman graduated from James Madison High School there. He attended Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., where he studied English and film and met Ms. Davis. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree in English in 1973, and they married in 1976.\\r\\nMr. Urman\u2019s career in the movie business began in the mailroom at Universal Pictures and continued at companies like United Artists, Columbia Pictures, Cinepix Film Properties and Lionsgate Films. Before moving to ThinkFilm, he was an executive producer of \u201cMonster\u2019s Ball,\u201d for which Halle Berry won an Academy Award for best actress in 2002.\\r\\nIn addition to Ms. Davis, with whom he lived in Montclair, N.J., Mr. Urman is survived by a sister, Dorothy Urman Denburg; a son, Oliver Davis-Urman; and a daughter, Cleo Davis-Urman.\\r\\nTwo more of his notable releases at ThinkFilm were Werner Herzog\u2019s documentary \u201cEncounters at the End of the World\u201d (2007) and \u201cBefore the Devil Knows You\u2019re Dead\u201d (2007), Sidney Lumet\u2019s last film, which starred Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke and Albert Finney.\\r\\nMs. Davis said in a telephone interview on Wednesday that the connecting thread among the varied films Mr. Urman chose to distribute was the excitement he got from them.\\r\\n\u201cIf it seized his imagination and he couldn\u2019t stop talking about it,\u201d she said, \u201che had to have it.

Job Gains Show Employers Shrugged Off Government Shutdown\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"The economy added 304,000 jobs in January, the 100th consecutive month of payroll gains. Unemployment ticked up to 4 percent, possibly a shutdown-related anomaly.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>Add the recent government shutdown to the list of things that didn\u2019t slow the American job market.\\r\\n<br>Over the past eight years, the American economy has endured trade tensions, debt-limit standoffs, foreign-policy crises and all manner of natural disasters. Through it all, companies kept on hiring.\\r\\n<p>The resilience continued in January as employers shrugged off both the monthlong shutdown and fears of an economic slowdown to add 304,000 jobs, far more than forecasters had anticipated. The report from the Labor Department marked the 100th consecutive month of job gains, more than double the previous record.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThis jobs report is showing no evidence of an economy slowing, certainly not falling into recession,\u201d said Michelle Meyer, chief United States economist for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cIt\u2019s still a tight labor market. Employers are still actively looking for jobs, and with wages ticking up, it looks like workers are getting some more bargaining power.\u201d\\r\\n<p>Friday\u2019s report does not mean the economy escaped the shutdown unscathed. The Congressional Budget Office this week estimated that the funding lapse shaved $11 billion off total output, $3 billion of which will never be recovered. Those totals don\u2019t include indirect costs from permits not issued, loans not processed and flights not taken because of delays at airports.\\r\\n<p>The effects on spending, investment and output should show up in other government reports, some of which were themselves delayed by the shutdown.\\r\\n<p>Those disruptions didn\u2019t deter employers, however. The unemployment rate rose slightly, to 4 percent, at least partly because of the idling of hundreds of thousands of federal workers. But hiring in the private sector was strong and broad-based, with manufacturers, retailers and construction companies all adding jobs. Wage growth, which has picked up in recent months after years of sluggish gains, remained solid, and the strong labor market continued to pull in workers from the sidelines.\\r\\n<br>The Labor Department did revise downward its estimate of December hiring by 90,000 jobs, an unusually large adjustment. But the strong growth in January, combined with upward revisions to earlier months, meant that the pace of hiring, averaged over six months, actually rose.\\r\\n<br>That combination of strong hiring and modest wage gains has put the economy on a strong, sustainable footing. More jobs means more income for consumers, which leads to more spending, and in turn more hiring.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThe virtuous cycle continues,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist for Barclays. \u201cWhat\u2019s kept this recovery going, what\u2019s kept the U.S. economy so resilient to all the things that have clouded the outlook, is a virtuous cycle of a continuously growing U.S. labor market.\u201d\\r\\n<p>None of the threats to the economy over the past several years have disrupted that central pattern. The shutdown, for example, caused ripple effects throughout the private sector, but companies and businesses also found ways to cope. Ben Herzon, an economist for Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm, said that as a result, the shutdown\u2019s economic impact might be more muted than simple economic models might suggest. \\r\\n<br>\u201cThe economy is resilient,\u201d Mr. Herzon said. \u201cPeople and businesses find a way to work around these disruptions. People want to buy stuff, and businesses want to find a way to make that happen.\u201d\\r\\n<br>James Diana and his wife started JD\u2019s Canine Cruiser, a dog-walking and pet-sitting business in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, in 2012. The area\u2019s strong economy has allowed them to expand the business and bring on more contract employees, many of whom are at-home parents and others who might not find work in a less robust economy.\\r\\n<br>Many of Mr. Diana\u2019s customers are federal employees or contractors, and the shutdown hit his business hard. He said cancellations in January were roughly double their normal level, costing him thousands of dollars in lost business. Government workers, he noted, will get back pay, but that won\u2019t help him.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThat actually is lost income for us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to get their money back. I\u2019m not going to get my money back.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Mr. Diana said he pared his own spending, but he also tried to fill in the gap in his business. He doubled down on efforts to find new customers, including on Thumbtack, an online marketplace for hiring people to complete tasks. \\r\\n<br>\u201cIt forced me to go out there and get more clients,\u201d he said \u2014 to \u201creally get out there and start cranking.\u201d\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<h2>A Hidden Shutdown?\\r\\n<br>The relative invisibility of the shutdown in Friday\u2019s data wasn\u2019t a total surprise. Because federal workers will receive back pay, the figures counted all of them as having been on payrolls in January, even if they weren\u2019t actually on the job.\\r\\n<br>Government contractors generally won\u2019t receive back pay, so if they didn\u2019t work, they weren\u2019t counted. Ditto for other private-sector workers who were laid off (or weren\u2019t hired) because of the shutdown. But most economists expected those effects to be small in an economy that employs more than 150 million people. Sure enough, private employers added nearly 300,000 jobs last month.\\r\\n<p>The shutdown does help explain why the unemployment rate ticked up in January. Unlike the monthly hiring figures, which come from a survey of employers and are based on their payrolls, the unemployment rate is based on a survey of households. In that survey, 175,000 more people than in December reported themselves as being unemployed because of a \u201ctemporary layoff\u201d \u2014 a total that included government workers.\\r\\n<br>\u201cWhere\u2019s your shutdown impact? There it is,\u201d said Brett Ryan, an economist for Deutsche Bank in New York. \u201cIt just showed up in the unemployment rate.\u201d\\r\\n<h2>Cautious, but Still Hiring\\r\\n<br>Economists have become increasingly concerned in recent months about a range of possible threats to the United States economy. Growth has slowed in Europe and China; trade tensions are threatening the American manufacturing sector; stock market jitters could make consumers less likely to spend; and the shutdown, of course, could erode confidence among consumers and businesses.\\r\\n<br>None of that, however, has yet affected the job market.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThere\u2019s a caution or concern in people\u2019s voices, but it hasn\u2019t turned into action,\u201d said Teresa Carroll, executive vice president for Kelly Services, a staffing firm. \u201cAnybody in a hiring situation in a company is probably waiting for that next shoe to drop, but it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re stopping.\u201d\\r\\n<br>It isn\u2019t just Friday\u2019s data that looked strong. Claims for unemployment insurance recently hit a nearly 50-year low. Paychecks are growing \u2014 data released Thursday showed that wages and salaries rose 3.1 percent in the final three months of 2018 compared with a year earlier, the fastest growth since the recession ended a decade ago. And employers report in private surveys that they plan to keep on adding workers, at least if they can find them.\\r\\n<p>\u201cThe underlying foundation hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d said Becky Frankiewicz, president of ManpowerGroup North America, a staffing firm. She said what she was hearing from clients was \u201cnice, robust optimism continuing around hiring.\u201d\\r\\n<br>As the unemployment rate has fallen, companies have had to work harder to find workers. Ms. Frankiewicz said companies were increasingly offering training, rethinking job requirements and letting employees work remotely. \\r\\n<br>They are also raising pay \u2014 a factor that may be attracting people who had previously stopped looking for work. The labor force grew by nearly half a million people in January, suggesting that more Americans are willing and able to work than the low unemployment rate might indicate.\\r\\n<br>\u201cIf wages are rising, that gives a greater incentive for folks to come back into the labor force and look for jobs,\u201d Ms. Meyer of Bank of America Merrill Lynch said.\\r\\n<h2>More Complications for Policymakers\\r\\n<br>The Federal Reserve had signaled this week that it was pressing \u201cpause\u201d on plans to continue raising interest rates this year. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed\u2019s chairman, said that \u201cthe case for raising rates has weakened somewhat\u201d because of low inflation and slowing global growth.\\r\\n<br>Friday\u2019s report seemed to offer a sharp counterpoint to those comments. The economy, at least in the United States, still seems strong, and wage growth has been picking up.\\r\\n<br>Still, economists said the report was unlikely to lead the Fed to reverse course yet again. \\r\\n<br>\u201cThis is just one piece of news,\u201d Mr. Ryan of Deutsche Bank said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to see several more of these before they\u2019re comfortable hiking again.\u201d\\r\\n<p>For President Trump, whose approval ratings have been battered by the shutdown, the Russia investigation and other factors, Friday\u2019s data was welcome news.

Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.\\r\\n<br>China, the world\u2019s coal juggernaut, has continued to produce more methane emissions from its coal mines despite its pledge to curb the planet-warming pollutant, according to new research.\\r\\n<br>In a paper published Tuesday in Nature Communications, researchers concluded that China had failed to meet its own government regulations requiring coal mines to rapidly reduce methane emissions, at least in the five years after 2010, when the regulations were passed.\\r\\n<br>It matters because coal is the world\u2019s dirtiest fossil fuel, and China is, by far, the largest producer in the world.\\r\\n<br>Coal accounts for 40 percent of electricity generation globally and an even higher share in China, which has abundant coal resources and more than four million workers employed in the coal sector. Scientists and policymakers agree that the world will have to quit coal to have any hope of averting catastrophic climate change.\\r\\n<p>How quickly China can do that, therefore, is crucial. \\r\\n<br>The Chinese government in 2010 required the state-run coal sector to reduce methane emissions by putting the gas to use \u2014 coal methane emissions can be used for power generation, for instance \u2014 or by capturing methane from mines and flaring it, which is still polluting, but not as much as releasing the gas into the atmosphere, according to the researchers.\\r\\n<br>It required that 6.2 million tons  of methane produced from coal mining be put to use by 2015.\\r\\n<br>An examination of satellite data collected between 2010 and 2015 painted a different picture. Not only were the reductions not made, but Chinese methane emissions actually increased by 1.2 million tons per year during the five-year period. \\r\\n<br>\u201cOur study indicates that, at least in terms of methane emissions, China\u2019s government is talking the talk but has not been able to walk the walk,\u201d Scot Miller, a professor at Johns Hopkins University who led the research team, said in a statement.\\r\\n<br>The study highlighted the difficulties China faces in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The technology used in China to capture methane from coal mines is sometimes outdated, Dr. Miller said, and it is difficult to build gas pipelines from mines in mountain areas.\\r\\n<p>Facing public outcry over air pollution, the Chinese authorities have tried to slow down the construction of new coal-fired power plants, have begun shutting down some old plants and have made their country the world leader in solar and wind power installation. Still, Chinese coal consumption grew in 2017, though at a far slower pace than before, and was on track to grow again in 2018, after declining in previous years.\\r\\n<p>Coal mining produces both carbon dioxide and methane emissions. Coal accounts for about a third of China\u2019s methane emissions, according to the researchers.\\r\\n<br>China\u2019s global coal operations are as important as what it does at home. Its powerful coal sector is building and financing coal-fired power plants in 17 countries, according to Urgewald, an advocacy group based in Germany that is pushing for a global exit from coal.\\r\\n<br>China has added 40 percent of the world\u2019s coal capacity since 2002, a huge increase over just 16 years, according to the International Energy Agency.\\r\\n<br>For more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"technology.10.txt\",\"id\":1620813714},{\"title\":\"Taliban to Meet Afghan Politicians (but Not Ghani) in Moscow\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"President Ashraf Ghani\u2019s Afghan government has been shut out of the insurgents\u2019 peace talks with the United States, and the meeting in Russia could undermine him further.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>KABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 The Taliban are expected to meet with Afghan opposition leaders in Moscow in the coming days, a development that could further undermine the government of President Ashraf Ghani, which has found itself excluded from the talks seeking an end to the 17-year war.\\r\\n<br>Even as the insurgents say they are close to a deal on core issues with American diplomats, they have refused to meet with the Afghan government.

But the venue \u2014 the President Hotel, which is owned by the Kremlin \u2014 and the number of visas that would be required suggested that, at the very least, the organizers were working closely with the Russian government.\\r\\n<br>A senior Afghan official said that Zamir Kabulov, the Russian presidential envoy to Afghanistan, was behind the initiative. In several discussions about the possibility of such a meeting, the Afghan government made it clear that it would participate in direct talks only with the Taliban, not a situation in which the government was one of several parties at the table, according to the official.\\r\\n<p>In response to a question about who was organizing the event, a senior Taliban official said it was the Russian Federation.\\r\\n<br>In public, at least, Russia has sought to distance itself from the talks. Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, did not mention them while discussing Afghan developments during a weekly briefing.\\r\\n<p>Tass, the Russian state-run news agency, quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying that the talks were unrelated to formal negotiations that the Russian government previously hosted, including a November conference in Moscow hosted by Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov that Taliban representatives also attended.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Ahmadi, the Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Russia had formally acknowledged that talks to end the war must be Afghan-led if they were to deliver a lasting peace.\\r\\n<br>\u201cWe hope Russia will follow through with that promise,\u201d he said.\\r\\n<br>Among the many Afghan politicians going to Moscow are Hamid Karzai, the former president, and Atta Mohammad Noor, a former governor and leader of Jamiat-e-Islami, a major political party, their offices confirmed. Mohammad Mohaqiq, the leader of Wahdat, another major party, is considering attending, his office said.\\r\\n<br>The Taliban will send representatives from their political office in Doha, Qatar, which has been leading the negotiations with American diplomats, said a spokesman for the office, Suhail Shaheen.\\r\\n<br>When Mr. Karzai was in power, similar efforts by the United States to start talks with the Taliban \u2014 which he, like Mr. Ghani, saw as legitimizing the insurgency and cutting him out of the early steps toward a deal \u2014 so angered him that he briefly called off talks with the Americans over a strategic security agreement.\\r\\n<br>He lashed out at Afghan political leaders who went to France to meet with the Taliban, in talks that were much less direct than the Moscow talks are likely to be.\\r\\n<p>Officials close to Mr. Ghani, who is seeking a second five-year term in an election scheduled for July, say the opposition leaders have seen their ability to dispense political patronage reduced by reforms introduced by the Afghan president. They accuse the opposition leaders of rallying to a rushed peace process because they want a share of power in any interim government formed with the Taliban, even if that means jeopardizing the progress the country has made since the insurgents were driven from power in 2001.\\r\\n<p>Recent remarks by the Taliban\u2019s chief negotiator, Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanekzai, have contributed to such concerns. In a videotaped interview that has circulated in Afghanistan, Mr. Stanekzai said the Taliban did not recognize the government and expected the Afghan Army to be disbanded after a peace deal, stirring memories in Kabul of the anarchy that followed the Soviet Union\u2019s withdrawal.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThis force, this army \u2014 this was made by the Americans,\u201d Mr. Stanekzai said. \u201cWhen the Americans leave, they will naturally finish.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Mr. Stanekzai\u2019s remarks may have amounted to a negotiating stance, and he said the Taliban did not seek a political \u201cmonopoly\u201d in Afghanistan. But to some, his rhetoric \u2014 \u201cwe will involve the nation, we will give the nation shares,\u201d he said at one point \u2014 suggested that the insurgents saw themselves as the dominant force in a future government.\\r\\n<br>The opposition leaders, for their part, say Mr. Ghani, has alienated much of the country\u2019s political elite, including some of those who helped bring him to power. They say that he could squander a rare opening for peace, and that his resistance stems from a fear that if talks progress, he could lose his chance for five more years of power.\\r\\n<br>Fariba Ahmadi Kakar, a member of the Afghan Parliament from Kandahar Province in the south, said that while any dialogue on ending the war was welcome, the government\u2019s absence from the talks in Doha, and now in Moscow, would complicate the situation.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThe absence of the government in all these important talks hurts us \u2014 even if this government has made mistakes, this is our government, this is our leadership,\u201d Ms. Kakar said. \u201cThe absence of the government in meetings where the conversation is about the future of Afghanistan could lead to the Taliban taking advantage at the cost of the system here.\u201d\\r\\n<br>But Ms. Kakar said she was equally concerned about the divisions among the Afghan political elite.\\r\\n<br>\u201cI hope we don\u2019t reach a day where the Taliban are ready for peace, but our leaders on this side can\u2019t make peace with each other,\u201d she said.\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"world.2.txt\",\"id\":391006090},{\"title\":\"Trump\u2019s Policies, Not His Insults, Contributed to the Fed\u2019s Shift\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"The Fed\u2019s newfound patience on raising interest rates is just what President Trump wanted.

The central bank did not raise its benchmark rate at its first meeting of 2019, and said it had no plans to raise rates in the foreseeable future.\\r\\n<br>The Fed\u2019s newfound patience delighted the White House, and Wall Street. It was seen as a concession to the Fed\u2019s critics, and as a boost for an economic expansion that is on the verge of becoming the longest in the nation\u2019s modern history.\\r\\n<br>\u201cWe have, by far, the strongest economy in the world!\u201d Mr. Trump exulted Friday morning on Twitter.\\r\\n<br>But the details of the Fed\u2019s decision suggest less cause for celebration.\\r\\n<p>Jerome H. Powell, the Fed\u2019s chairman, said Wednesday that the Fed was pausing not because it embraced Mr. Trump\u2019s argument that the economy was in ruddy health, but because the expansion faced growing threats, including from the impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s own policies.\\r\\n<br>Among these, Mr. Powell listed the trade war with China and the risk of another government shutdown.\\r\\n<br>In effect, the Fed concluded the expansion might not survive the combination of more rate increases and Mr. Trump\u2019s economic policies, so it pulled off the road to reduce the risk of a crash.\\r\\n<br>For the moment, of course, there is little practical difference between the White House view that rates should stay low because the economy is strong and the Fed view that rates should remain low because the economy is fragile. The tension will resume if growth revives.\\r\\n<br>The Fed\u2019s shift also stopped well short of the president\u2019s stated preferences.\\r\\n<br>The central bank still raised rates four times in 2018, in the face of Mr. Trump\u2019s warnings, and Mr. Powell said Wednesday that he thought those increases were warranted. Friday\u2019s report that the economy added 304,000 jobs in January suggests that the Fed hasn\u2019t yet choked the economy.\\r\\n<p>The Fed similarly stopped short of accepting Mr. Trump\u2019s advice that it should \u201cstop with the 50Bs,\u201d referring to its policy of reducing its bond portfolio by about $50 billion each month.\\r\\n<br>While saying it would continue reducing its holdings for now, the Fed was at pains to reassure investors that it stands ready to adjust the policy as necessary and that it is likely to stop sooner than previously expected.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Trump picked Mr. Powell to serve as the Fed\u2019s chairman. But last year, as interest rates rose and the stock market declined, the president repeatedly attacked Fed policy as \u201ccrazy,\u201d \u201cwild\u201d and \u201cloco.\u201d He fretted to aides that Mr. Powell would \u201cturn me into Hoover,\u201d a reference to the president during the early years of the Great Depression, and he asked aides whether he could replace the chairman.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on the Fed are not easily assembled into a coherent critique. But some lieutenants have advanced the argument that the administration\u2019s economic policies are expanding the labor force and increasing productivity, resulting in economic growth without inflation.\\r\\n<br>In this view, the Fed should leave interest rates at a low level to allow the expansion to continue.\\r\\n<p>\u201cMy hope is that the Fed, under its new management, understands that more people working and faster economic growth do not cause inflation,\u201d Larry Kudlow, the head of the National Economic Council, said last year. He added that the Fed should increase interest rates \u201cvery slowly.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Administration officials also blamed the Fed\u2019s policies for causing the wobbles in financial markets last year.\\r\\n<p>Mr. Powell, by contrast, said on Wednesday that the economic outlook was deteriorating for reasons unrelated to the Fed\u2019s policies. He pointed to storm clouds including economic weakness in China and Europe and tightening financial conditions, as well as the impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies.\\r\\n<br>He made the nuanced point that the Fed still regards solid economic growth as the most likely outcome for the coming year but that result is now somewhat less likely.\\r\\n<br>\u201cAt such times, common-sense risk management suggests patiently awaiting greater clarity,\u201d he said.\\r\\n<br>The persistent sluggishness of inflation, which has remained below the Fed\u2019s preferred 2 percent annual pace since the 2008 crisis, also played a role. Mr. Powell said the Fed had the luxury of being patient because the risk of higher inflation \u201cappears to have diminished.\u201d\\r\\n<br>\u201cIt seems to me that what\u2019s happened is the Fed is saying, \u2018We\u2019re more concerned now about the secular stagnation issues than inflation at this moment,\u2019\u201d said Lewis Alexander, the chief United States economist at Nomura. \u201cAnd I think to be perfectly frank that\u2019s a perfectly reasonable place for them to be.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Analysts said the negative reaction of financial markets after the Fed\u2019s previous meeting, in December, was a particularly important factor. The Fed raised rates and predicted two more increases in 2019. Mr. Powell also emphasized the Fed\u2019s commitment to reducing bond holdings, which some investors saw as overly aggressive.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThey were planning on roaring forward with this balance sheet roll-off, and the market is like: \u2018Oh, my God! That will crush the economy!\u2019\u201d said Julia Coronado, a former Fed economist and the president of MacroPolicy Perspectives. \u201cAnd so they recalibrated. Good.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser at the financial firm Allianz, said the Fed\u2019s decision Wednesday \u201ccame as absolutely no surprise.\u201d Since the global financial crisis, he said, the Fed has backed down each time investors objected to the tightening of monetary policy.\\r\\n<p>Among those moments: the 2013 \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d and the decision to postpone rate increases in 2016.\\r\\n<br>\u201cIt\u2019s watching the same movie over and over again,\u201d he said.\\r\\n<br>The question, Mr. El-Erian said, is whether the Fed should be listening to the markets.\\r\\n<br>\u201cIf you believe that the market is signaling something genuine about the economy that the Fed has not yet understood, then it\u2019s not a bad thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIf, however, you believe that the market has gotten used to having the Fed as its rich uncle, then this is a bad thing.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Some Fed officials appear more receptive to the kind of arguments advanced by Mr. Kudlow, notably Richard Clarida, who became the Fed\u2019s vice chairman in September and said in a November speech that he saw some signs of a stronger trend in productivity growth.\\r\\n<br>Other Fed officials said last summer, when there were fewer risks to the economic outlook, that the central bank should keep raising rates into restrictive territory to slow what they saw as unsustainable growth.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Powell has sought to push the question into the future, suggesting he is open to either possibility. He has said the Fed will not respond to wage growth as a sufficient sign of inflationary pressure. Similarly, he said Wednesday that evidence of inflation would be a \u201cbig part\u201d of any case for more rate increases.\\r\\n<br>The problem for Mr. Powell is that monetary policy exerts a gradual influence on economic conditions, meaning that policymakers must calibrate policy based on forecasts.\\r\\n<br>Sooner or later, Mr. Powell will need to decide what he thinks about Trumponomics.\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"business.7.txt\",\"id\":1668447843},{\"title\":\"Woman Killed by Fire in Menstruation Hut, as Nepal Fights a Tradition\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"Despite a ban and efforts to educate Nepalese about a centuries-old practice of banishing menstruating women to isolated huts, the tradition stubbornly lives on.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>KATHMANDU, Nepal \u2014 Parbati Bogati knew what to do when her period came.\\r\\n<br>Ms. Bogati, 21, sequestered herself in an abandoned house, in keeping with a centuries-old taboo that declares menstruating women impure, officials from her area in rural western Nepal said.\\r\\n<br>As the temperature dropped below freezing on Wednesday evening, she tried to keep warm, apparently burning wood and clothing.\\r\\n<br>By the next morning, her legs were charred and she was dead.\\r\\n<br>\u201cIt seems she also died from suffocation,\u201d said Lal Bahadur Dhami, the deputy superintendent of the area\u2019s police.

During women\u2019s periods, it bars them from touching neighbors\u2019 food or entering temples. They cannot use communal water sources or kitchen utensils. It is considered bad luck to touch them.\\r\\n<p>Instead, women who observe the taboo are banished to mud or stone huts, some of them no bigger than closets.

It\u2019s a live performance that lights up your creativity \u2026 a sweat session that sends your endorphins coursing ... a visionary who expands your way of thinking.\u201d From this point of view, not only does one never stop hustling \u2014 one never exits a kind of work rapture, in which the chief purpose of exercising or attending a concert is to get inspiration that leads back to the desk.\\r\\n<p>Ryan Harwood, the chief executive of One37pm\u2019s parent company, told me that the site\u2019s content is aimed at a younger generation of people who are seeking permission to follow their dreams. \u201cThey want to know how to own their moment, at any given moment,\u201d he said.\\r\\n<br>\u201cOwning one\u2019s moment\u201d is a clever way to rebrand \u201csurviving the rat race.\u201d In the new work culture, enduring or even merely liking one\u2019s job is not enough. Workers should love what they do, and then promote that love on social media, thus fusing their identities to that of their employers. Why else would LinkedIn build its own version of Snapchat Stories?\\r\\n<br>This is toil glamour, and it is going mainstream. Most visibly, WeWork \u2014 which investors recently valued at $47 billion \u2014 is on its way to becoming the Starbucks of office culture. It has exported its brand of performative workaholism to 27 countries, with 400,000 tenants, including workers from 30 percent of the Global Fortune 500.\\r\\n<br>In January, WeWork\u2019s founder, Adam Neumann, announced that his start-up was rebranding itself as the We Company, to reflect an expansion into residential real estate and education. Describing the shift, Fast Company wrote: \u201cRather than just renting desks, the company aims to encompass all aspects of people\u2019s lives, in both physical and digital worlds.\u201d The ideal client, one imagines, is someone so enamored of the WeWork office aesthetic \u2014 whip-cracking cucumbers and all \u2014 that she sleeps in a WeLive apartment, works out at a Rise by We gym, and sends her children to a WeGrow school.\\r\\n<br>From this vantage, \u201cOffice Space,\u201d the Gen-X slacker paean that came out 20 years ago next month, feels like science fiction from a distant realm. It\u2019s almost impossible to imagine a start-up worker bee of today confessing, as protagonist Peter Gibbons does, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m lazy. It\u2019s that I just don\u2019t care.\u201d Workplace indifference just doesn\u2019t have a socially acceptable hashtag.\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<h2>\u2018It\u2019s grim and exploitative\u2019\\r\\n<br>It\u2019s not difficult to view hustle culture as a swindle. After all, convincing a generation of workers to beaver away is convenient for those at the top.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThe vast majority of people beating the drums of hustle-mania are not the people doing the actual work. They\u2019re the managers, financiers and owners,\u201d said David Heinemeier Hansson, the co-founder of Basecamp, a software company. We spoke in October, as he was promoting his new book, \u201cIt Doesn\u2019t Have to Be Crazy at Work,\u201d about creating healthy company cultures.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Heinemeier Hansson said that despite data showing long hours improve neither productivity nor creativity, myths about overwork persist because they justify the extreme wealth created for a small group of elite techies. \u201cIt\u2019s grim and exploitative,\u201d he said.\\r\\n<p>Elon Musk, who stands to reap stock compensation upward of $50 billion if his company, Tesla, meets certain performance levels, is a prime example of extolling work by the many that will primarily benefit him. He tweeted in November that there are easier places to work than Tesla, \u201cbut nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week.\u201d The correct number of hours \u201cvaries per person,\u201d he continued, but is \u201cabout 80 sustained, peaking about 100 at times. Pain level increases exponentially above 80.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Mr. Musk, who has more than 24 million Twitter followers, further noted that if you love what you do, \u201cit (mostly) doesn\u2019t feel like work.\u201d Even he had to soften the lie of T.G.I.M. with a parenthetical.\\r\\n<br>Arguably, the technology industry started this culture of work zeal sometime around the turn of the millennium, when the likes of Google started to feed, massage and even play doctor to its employees. The perks were meant to help companies attract the best talent \u2014 and keep employees at their desks longer. It seemed enviable enough: Who wouldn\u2019t want an employer that literally took care of your dirty laundry?\\r\\n<br>But today, as tech culture infiltrates every corner of the business world, its hymns to the virtues of relentless work remind me of nothing so much as Soviet-era propaganda, which promoted impossible-seeming feats of worker productivity to motivate the labor force. One obvious difference, of course, is that those Stakhanovite posters had an anticapitalist bent, criticizing the fat cats profiting from free enterprise. Today\u2019s messages glorify personal profit, even if bosses and investors \u2014 not workers \u2014 are the ones capturing most of the gains. Wage growth has been essentially stagnant for years.\\r\\n<p>Perhaps we\u2019ve all gotten a little hungry for meaning. Participation in organized religion is falling, especially among American millennials. In San Francisco, where I live, I\u2019ve noticed that the concept of productivity has taken on an almost spiritual dimension. Techies here have internalized the idea \u2014 rooted in the Protestant work ethic \u2014 that work is not something you do to get what you want; the work itself is all. Therefore any life hack or company perk that optimizes their day, allowing them to fit in even more work, is not just desirable but inherently good.\\r\\n<br>Aidan Harper, who created a European workweek-shrinkage campaign called 4 Day Week, argues that this is dehumanizing and toxic. \u201cIt creates the assumption that the only value we have as human beings is our productivity capability \u2014 our ability to work, rather than our humanity,\u201d he told me.\\r\\n<br>It\u2019s cultist, Mr. Harper added, to convince workers to buy into their own exploitation with a change-the-world message. \u201cIt\u2019s creating the idea that Elon Musk is your high priest,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going into your church every day and worshiping at the altar of work.\u201d\\r\\n<br>For congregants of the Cathedral of Perpetual Hustle, spending time on anything that\u2019s nonwork related has become a reason to feel guilty. Jonathan Crawford, a San Francisco-based entrepreneur, told me that he sacrificed his relationships and gained more than 40 pounds while working on Storenvy, his e-commerce start-up. If he socialized, it was at a networking event. If he read, it was a business book. He rarely did anything that didn\u2019t have a \u201cdirect R.O.I.,\u201d or return on investment, for his company.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Crawford changed his lifestyle after he realized it made him miserable. Now, as an entrepreneur-in-residence at 500 Start-ups, an investment firm, he tells fellow founders to seek out nonwork-related activities like reading fiction, watching movies or playing games. Somehow this comes off as radical advice. \u201cIt\u2019s oddly eye-opening to them because they didn\u2019t realize they saw themselves as a resource to be expended,\u201d Mr. Crawford said.\\r\\n<br>It\u2019s easy to become addicted to the pace and stress of work in 2019. Bernie Klinder, a consultant for a large tech company, said he tried to limit himself to five 11-hour days per week, which adds up to an extra day of productivity. \u201cIf your peers are competitive, working a \u2018normal workweek\u2019 will make you look like a slacker,\u201d he wrote in an email.\\r\\n<br>Still, he\u2019s realistic about his place in the rat race. \u201cI try to keep in mind that if I dropped dead tomorrow, all of my acrylic workplace awards would be in the trash the next day,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand my job would be posted in the paper before my obituary.\u201d\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<h2>Lusty for Monday mornings\\r\\n<br>The logical endpoint of excessively avid work, of course, is burnout. That is the subject of a recent viral essay by the BuzzFeed cultural critic Anne Helen Petersen, which thoughtfully addresses one of the incongruities of hustle-mania in the young. Namely: If Millennials are supposedly lazy and entitled, how can they also be obsessed with killing it at their jobs?\\r\\n<br>Millennials, Ms. Petersen argues, are just desperately striving to meet their own high expectations. An entire generation was raised to expect that good grades and extracurricular overachievement would reward them with fulfilling jobs that feed their passions. Instead, they wound up with precarious, meaningless work and a mountain of student loan debt. And so posing as a rise-and-grinder, lusty for Monday mornings, starts to make sense as a defense mechanism.\\r\\n<br>Most jobs \u2014 even most good jobs! \u2014 are full of pointless drudgery. Most corporations let us down in some way. And yet years after the HBO satire \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d made the vacuous mission statement \u201cmaking the world a better place\u201d a recurring punch line, many companies still cheerlead the virtues of work with high-minded messaging. For example, Spotify, a company that lets you listen to music, says that its mission is \u201cto unlock the potential of human creativity.\u201d Dropbox, which lets you upload files and stuff, says its purpose is \u201cto unleash the world\u2019s creative energy by designing a more enlightened way of working.\u201d\\r\\n<br>David Spencer, a professor of economics at Leeds University Business School, says that such posturing by companies, economists and politicians dates at least to the rise of mercantilism in 16th-century Europe. \u201cThere has been an ongoing struggle by employers to venerate work in ways that distract from its unappealing features,\u201d he said. But such propaganda can backfire. In 17th-century England, work was lauded as a cure for vice, Mr. Spencer said, but the unrewarding truth just drove workers to drink more.\\r\\n<br>Internet companies may have miscalculated in encouraging employees to equate their work with their intrinsic value as human beings. After a long era of basking in positive esteem, the tech industry is experiencing a backlash both broad and fierce, on subjects from monopolistic behavior to spreading disinformation and inciting racial violence. And workers are discovering how much power they wield. In November, some 20,000 Googlers participated in a walkout protesting the company\u2019s handling of sexual abusers. Other company employees shut down an artificial intelligence contract with the Pentagon that could have helped military drones become more lethal.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Heinemeier Hansson cited the employee protests as evidence that millennial workers would eventually revolt against the culture of overwork. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t going to stand for this,\u201d he said, using an expletive, \u201cor buy the propaganda that eternal bliss lies at monitoring your own bathroom breaks.\u201d He was referring to an interview that the former chief executive of Yahoo, Marissa Mayer, gave in 2016, in which she said that working 130 hours a week was possible \u201cif you\u2019re strategic about when you sleep, when you shower, and how often you go to the bathroom.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Ultimately, workers must decide if they admire or reject this level of devotion. Ms. Mayer\u2019s comments were widely panned on social media when the interview ran, but since then, Quora users have eagerly shared their own strategies for mimicking her schedule. Likewise, Mr. Musk\u2019s \u201cpain level\u201d tweets drew plenty of critical takes, but they also garnered just as many accolades and requests for jobs.\\r\\n<br>The grim reality of 2019 is that begging a billionaire for employment via Twitter is not considered embarrassing, but a perfectly plausible way to get ahead. On some level, you have to respect the hustlers who see a dismal system and understand that success in it requires total, shameless buy-in. If we\u2019re doomed to toil away until we die, we may as well pretend to like it. Even on Mondays.\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"world.1.txt\",\"id\":-727259249},{\"title\":\"U.S. Midwest Freezes, Australia Burns: This Is the Age of Weather Extremes\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"Numbing cold hit parts of the United States as wildfires raged in Australia\u2019s record-breaking heat. Here's the climate change connection.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.\\r\\n<br>In Chicago, officials warned about the risk of almost instant frostbite on what could be the city\u2019s coldest day ever. Warming centers opened around the Midwest. And schools and universities closed throughout the region as rare polar winds streamed down from the Arctic.\\r\\n<br>At the same time, on the other side of the planet, wildfires raged in Australia\u2019s record-breaking heat. Soaring air-conditioner use overloaded electrical grids and caused widespread power failures. The authorities slowed and canceled trams to save power. Labor leaders called for laws that would require businesses to close when temperatures reached hazardous levels: nearly 116 degrees Fahrenheit, or 47 Celsius, as was the case last week in Adelaide, the capital of South Australia.\\r\\n<br>This is weather in the age of extremes. It comes on top of multiple extremes, all kinds, in all kinds of places.\\r\\n<br>\u201cWhen something happens \u2014 whether it\u2019s a cold snap, a wildfire, a hurricane, any of those things \u2014 we need to think beyond what we have seen in the past and assume there\u2019s a high probability that it will be worse than anything we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Crystal A. Kolden, an associate professor at the University of Idaho, who specializes in wildfires and who is currently working in Tasmania during one of the state\u2019s worst fire seasons.\\r\\n<p>Consider these recent examples: Heat records were toppled from Norway to Algeria last year. In parts of Australia, a drought has gone on so long that a child in kindergarten will hardly have seen rain in her lifetime. And California saw its most ruinous wildfires ever in 2018, triggering a bankruptcy filing this week by the state\u2019s largest utility, Pacific Gas and Electric.\\r\\n<br>Is it climate change?\\r\\n<br>Heat and drought extremes are consistent with scientific consensus: More greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere bring a greater likelihood of abnormally high temperatures. Also, broadly speaking, scientists say, a hotter planet makes extreme weather more frequent and more intense.\\r\\n<br>The real-life numbers bear out the climate models. Concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are higher than they have been in 800,000 years, and average global temperatures have risen. The last four years have been the hottest on record, according to the World Meteorological Organization, and the 20 warmest years on record have all come in the past 22 years. Ocean temperatures have broken records several straight years.\\r\\n<p>As for the extremely low temperatures this week in parts of the United States, they stand in sharp contrast to the trend toward warmer winters. They may also be a result of warming, strangely enough. \\r\\n<br>Emerging research suggests that a warming Arctic is causing changes in the jet stream and pushing polar air down to latitudes that are unaccustomed to them and often unprepared. Hence this week\u2019s atypical chill over large swaths of the Northeast and Midwest.\\r\\n<p>Friederike Otto, an Oxford University climate scientist who studies how specific weather events are exacerbated by global warming, said that while not all of these extreme events can be attributed to climate change, the profound changes in the earth\u2019s atmosphere raise \u201cthe likelihood of a large number of extreme events.\u201d\\r\\n<br>\u201cThis means it becomes crucial to understand well where your community is vulnerable and this can be something that was not on the agenda without climate change,\u201d she said.\\r\\n<br>Take Chicago, for instance. It woke up to the hazards of heat two decades ago, when a five-day heat wave in the summer of 1995 killed hundreds of people, particularly those who lived alone. The city developed a heat action plan. It planted thousands of trees, set up neighborhood cooling centers and created a text messaging system so residents could request that city officials check on vulnerable people. \\r\\n<br>Now comes a cold spell that a generation of Chicago residents has never experienced, with Wednesday night temperatures that dipped to minus 21 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 29 Celsius (the city\u2019s record low is minus 27 Fahrenheit, recorded in January 1985). The city said it would send out five buses to cruise the streets as mobile warming centers for homeless people. It has issued instructions on how to warm pipes so they don\u2019t freeze.\\r\\n<p>Extreme heat, though, is the bigger problem overall. \\r\\n<br>Heat records have been broken twice as often as cold records in the United States since the 2000s.\\r\\n<br>One recent study in the journal PLOS Medicine projected a fivefold rise in heat-related deaths for the United States by 2080. The outlook for less wealthy countries is worse; for the Philippines, researchers forecast 12 times more deaths. Extreme heat is already devastating the health and livelihoods of tens of millions of people, especially in South Asia. \\r\\n<br>Extreme heat also affects the nutritional value of many crops. Even some of our most precious indulgences, like coffee, are in danger as temperatures rise.\\r\\n<p>This year, heat has been a problem in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. In Alaska, warmer-than-usual temperatures forced the cancellation of sled dog races, while cities in New Zealand, where the weather is generally so temperate that most homes don\u2019t have heating or air-conditioners, broke heat records. On Tuesday, Wellington, the capital, soared past 87 degrees Fahrenheit, the highest since record-keeping began in 1927, and Hamilton topped 91 degrees, the highest since record-keeping began in 1940.\\r\\n<br>Bob Henson, a meteorologist at Weather Underground, a forecasting service, said that in preparing for how climate change affects the weather, \u201cwe have to be prepared for a wider range of possibilities.\u201d\\r\\n<p>Some preparation is connected to resiliency. Mayors promise to make their cities more resilient to climate change after one disaster or another. Scientists experiment with crop seeds that are more resilient to the vagaries of extreme heat and drought.\\r\\n<br>Dr. Kolden, the fire specialist, noted that as a species, we pride ourselves on being resilient. But that human trait can also have a downside. It\u2019s why, often, even when officials tell us to evacuate from a fire zone or a flood plain, we don\u2019t. We think we\u2019ll make it, because we\u2019ve made it before. Or that the forecasters are wrong.\\r\\n<br>\u201cIn our DNA, we\u2019ve got this extreme resilience baked in,\u201d Dr. Kolden said. \u201cThat ends up being our downfall when it comes to the changing conditions.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Livia Albeck-Ripka and Charlotte Graham-McLay contributed reporting. \\r\\n<br>For more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"technology.4.txt\",\"id\":1884837133},{\"title\":\"Apple Says It Has Fixed FaceTime Security Bug\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"A software update will be released next week for owners of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers, the company said.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>Apple said Friday that it had fixed a security flaw in iPhones that allowed people to call another iPhone via FaceTime and listen in on conversations even if the recipient didn\u2019t answer, resolving an alarming vulnerability that undermined the company\u2019s public commitment to security. A software update will be released next week, the company said.\\r\\n<br>The new update will allow owners of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers to re-enable Group FaceTime, the feature that had allowed the potential eavesdropping, Apple said.

She even keeps daily records of conversations, activities and meals.\\r\\n<br>But none of this bookkeeping is for her job as a marketing professional. It\u2019s all for her children\u2019s preschool \u2014 before she can even head to the office.\\r\\n<br>Like so many working mothers in Japan, Ms. Nishimasa, 38, is swamped by onerous, bureaucratic tasks that have nothing to do with her profession but constrain her participation in the work force at a time when the country says it desperately needs more from women like her.\\r\\n<br>Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has an explicit goal of energizing his nation\u2019s puttering economy by elevating women in the labor force, an initiative catchily referred to as \u201cwomenomics.\u201d\\r\\n<p>At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January, Mr. Abe boasted that 67 percent of women were working in Japan, an all-time high and \u201chigher than, say, in the United States.\u201d\\r\\n<br>But many of those women are stuck in limited roles in the workplace, and one of the biggest hindrances to their ambitions \u2014 and the nation\u2019s as a whole \u2014 is the disproportionate burden women shoulder at home.\\r\\n<br>It is a legacy of the country\u2019s exacting domestic expectations and rigid gender roles for who performs them. While Japanese women have entered the work force at historic levels, their avalanche of domestic responsibilities is not shrinking \u2014 and men are typically not helping.\\r\\n<br>In fact, men in Japan do fewer hours of household chores and child care than in any of the world\u2019s wealthiest nations.\\r\\n<br>According to an analysis of government data by Noriko O. Tsuya, an economics professor at Keio University in Tokyo, women who work more than 49 hours a week typically do close to 25 hours of housework a week. Their husbands do an average of less than five.\\r\\n<p>\u201cCompared with what happened in women\u2019s employment,\u201d said Ms. Tsuya, \u201cthere has been so little change, or a lack thereof, in gender relations at home.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Consider Ms. Nishimasa\u2019s daily routine. The preschool her two youngest children attend requires the family to keep daily journals recording their temperatures and what they eat twice a day, along with descriptions of their moods, sleeping hours and playtime. On top of that, her 8-year-old son\u2019s elementary school and after-school tutoring class require that a parent personally signs off on every homework assignment.\\r\\n<br>The paperwork, of course, is just the beginning. There is cooking, cleaning and laundry, often at a scale that far exceeds what most Westerners do. Cooking a typical Japanese dinner often involves preparing multiple small dishes. Packed lunches can be works of art. Dishwashers are not yet ubiquitous. And as for laundry, few families own dryers big enough for large loads, so wet clothes are generally hoisted on clotheslines.\\r\\n<br>She does the vast majority of it all.\\r\\n<p>Her husband, a management consultant, often stays late at the office or goes out drinking with clients \u2014 which are also deeply entrenched expectations in Japan, particularly for men.\\r\\n<br>But Japan\u2019s economy needs educated women like Ms. Nishimasa to work to their full potential. After World War II, as the nation entered a period of rapid economic growth, Japanese women typically quit work when they married or gave birth, taking care of the home while their husbands worked punishingly long hours to power Japan Inc.\u2019s industrial expansion.\\r\\n<br>In the late 1970s, married women slowly started to enter the work force. Then, when Japan\u2019s stock and property bubbles popped in the early 1990s, large numbers of them went back to work to keep their families afloat financially.\\r\\n<br>After that, Japan, once the economic powerhouse of Asia, struggled to lift itself from a protracted period of stagnation. It was overtaken by China as the world\u2019s second-largest economy in 2011, and Mr. Abe has staked much of his reputation on returning the economy to steady growth and keeping it from becoming a global afterthought.\\r\\n<p>Now, with a declining and rapidly aging population, Japanese employers are struggling with a severe labor shortage. And while the government has expanded some visa categories for foreigners, the country is still opposed to increasing immigration significantly. So Mr. Abe has underscored the importance of working women to shore up the economy for the long term.\\r\\n<br>But more than half of working women are employed part time, and about a third are on temporary contracts, reinforcing a large pay gap between men and women.\\r\\n<br>According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, women in Japan represent fewer than 1 percent of management positions, compared with an average of 4.6 percent among the world\u2019s most developed nations.\\r\\n<br>Kathy Matsui, a Goldman Sachs strategist who wrote influential papers that Mr. Abe relied on when formulating his \u201cwomenomics\u201d policy, said that raising women\u2019s employment rates to the same level as men\u2019s could increase the country\u2019s economic output by more than 10 percent.\\r\\n<br>But the boost to the Japanese economy would be much larger if women could pursue higher-level careers and were appropriately paid, Ms. Matsui added.\\r\\n<br>\u201cHow do we make that happen?\u201d she said.\\r\\n<p>At the moment, Japanese women often face a double-edged sword.\\r\\n<br>Like many Japanese companies, Ms. Nishimasa\u2019s employer accommodates her towering domestic responsibilities. Until her youngest child, now 2, enters second grade, she can work a shortened seven-hour day, albeit for 30 percent lower pay. She is never asked to do the kind of overtime she regularly put in before her children were born, when she was often at the office until 10 p.m. or later.\\r\\n<p>But because of that, she has not been promoted in eight years and has received scant pay raises.\\r\\n<br>\u201cWhen I asked why,\u201d she said, \u201cmy boss said my output was lower because I work fewer hours.\u201d\\r\\n<h2>Overstretched at Home and Work\\r\\n<br>After Ms. Nishimasa graduated from a top university in Tokyo, she worked for a textbook publisher as a sales associate. With a sunny disposition and her ease at striking up conversations, she quickly excelled.\\r\\n<br>She married four years later. Much to her shock, the company automatically converted her employment status to part-time, she said.\\r\\n<br>\u201cMy boss started saying, \u2018You are not long for this job because you\u2019re probably just going to go off and have kids, right?\u2019\u201d she recalled.\\r\\n<br>She looked for another job, but prospective employers said, \u201cYou probably can\u2019t work late, right?\u201d or \u201cDoes your husband understand how busy you will be?\u201d\\r\\n<br>The publisher where she landed did not ask her marital status. But the hours were intense, and when she did get pregnant, at 29, she did not slow down, often remaining in the office until midnight. She miscarried in the final month of her pregnancy.\\r\\n<br>She got pregnant again, yet continued working long hours, anxious not to appear to be shirking her share of the work. When she left at 10 p.m., she recalled, \u201cI was the earliest one leaving and I would have to beg my colleagues for forgiveness.\u201d\\r\\n<p>After giving birth, Ms. Nishimasa never thought of quitting. But because her husband is expected to meet rigorous targets for raises and promotions, Ms. Nishimasa cut back on work to take care of the children.\\r\\n<br>\u201cTheoretically, it sounds ideal to have me work fewer hours and Yoshiko work more,\u201d said her husband, Kazuhiro Nishimasa. \u201cBut realistically, it is not feasible.\u201d\\r\\n<p>The juggle took a toll. One rainy morning, Ms. Nishimasa wrestled with the children while rushing down the stairs with two big bags of clothes, towels, washcloths and water bottles required by their day care. In her hurry, she slipped and fell, breaking a leg.\\r\\n<br>\u201cI was pushing myself too much,\u201d she said.\\r\\n<br>After the accident, Mr. Nishimasa came home early in the evenings for two months and agreed to drop off the children at day care on his way to work, one of the few tasks he still handles for the family.\\r\\n<br>Now, Mr. Nishimasa is back to working long hours to keep up with their mortgage payments. He rarely makes it home before 10 p.m., and is often out much later. On Saturdays, he sleeps in while his wife shuttles the three children to piano lessons or sports activities before he wakes up.\\r\\n<br>Since Ms. Nishimasa broke her leg, her husband has never left work in the middle of the day. If a child gets sick or hurt, or if school ends early, she gets the call every time.\\r\\n<br>Ms. Nishimasa tries getting to work early once a week. She helps get the children dressed, makes breakfast and then heads to the office to snag some quiet time before most of her colleagues arrive.\\r\\n<p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t strictly reserve that time,\u201d she said, \u201cmy husband will leave everything to me.\u201d\\r\\n<h2>Gender Equality a Distant Dream\\r\\n<br>Just over half of Japanese mothers go back to work after the birth of their first child. But they often have part-time jobs while their husbands continue to work brutal hours, contributing to a phenomenon known as \u201ckaroshi,\u201d or \u201cdeath from overwork.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Some experts argue that Japan\u2019s culture of overwork is unnecessary, leading to inefficiencies and low productivity. If everyone worked fewer hours, women might be able to catch up and Japanese society as a whole would benefit, they contend.\\r\\n<br>Despite some efforts to modify the work culture, excessive hours remain the norm, helping explain why men contribute so little to housework or child care: They simply do not have much time.\\r\\n<br>\u201cIf the work day could be shortened in Japan, I think a younger generation of men would do more as fathers,\u201d said Margarita Estevez-Abe, associate professor of political science at Syracuse University.\\r\\n<br>Entrenched cultural expectations are another obstacle.\\r\\n<br>Last year, when Daiwa House, a homebuilder, conducted a survey of 300 working couples, most of the respondents said that women completed close to 90 percent of the chores at home, many of them unacknowledged by their husbands. The results went viral on social media under the hashtag \u201cnamonaki kaji,\u201d which roughly translates as \u201cinvisible house chores.\u201d\\r\\n<br>\u201cThe awareness of men is still so low,\u201d said Kazuko Yoshida, 38, a graphic designer and mother of two young children in Tokyo. \u201cMy husband does not have a gender equality concept.\u201d\\r\\n<p>Ms. Yoshida drops off and picks up the children every day, and cooks, cleans, bathes and puts them to bed each night. When the preschool asked parents to make a handmade doll for each child, Ms. Yoshida stayed up nights sewing them.\\r\\n<p>Her husband, Takahisa Yoshida, says he wants to be more involved with his children than his own father, who did nothing at home. But he says he does not have the confidence to handle two young children on his own.\\r\\n<br>\u201cI work so hard,\u201d he said. \u201cI come home late at night and am exhausted in the morning.\u201d\\r\\n<br>As Ms. Yoshida left the office to pick up her children, she sat on the platform at the train station and let two trains go by before climbing into a packed car to head to the day care center. It was her only break all day.\\r\\n<h2> Multitasking Moms\\r\\n<br>On a Friday afternoon, Ms. Nishimasa dashed out of the office to pick up her daughter Mei, 5, and youngest son, Haruki, 2, heading straight for the child-size mattresses stacked in their preschool.\\r\\n<br>She grabbed their nap pads, stripped off the sheets and blankets and put on a fresh set she had washed at home. She planned to come back with even more sheets the next day \u2014 a Saturday \u2014 to make the scramble of the workweek a little more manageable.\\r\\n<br>Then she retrieved Mei\u2019s indoor shoes \u2014 they also needed washing \u2014 before a teacher handed her some construction paper: a weekend homework assignment to make a flag.\\r\\n<br>Outside, with the wind gusting, Ms. Nishimasa loaded both children onto a bicycle, shoved a teddy bear into a bag of laundry, hiked up her skirt and climbed on for the ride home.\\r\\n<p>They arrived just after 6 p.m. Ten minutes later, her oldest son, Kazuaki, 8, breezed in from an after-school program, dumping his backpack and snatching candy from Haruki\u2019s hands, prompting the toddler to bleat in protest.\\r\\n<p>Ms. Nishimasa strapped on an apron and began chopping, fixing an array of dishes: marinated cucumber and tomato salad, mustard greens with sesame seeds, steamed squash and hot bowls of miso soup and rice.\\r\\n<br>The children, indifferent to the spread, gazed at cartoons. Ms. Nishimasa snatched bites of dinner while loading the washing machine and drawing a bath. She checked Kazuaki\u2019s homework for the corrections ordered by his teacher, rinsed the dishes and put the leftovers away.\\r\\n<br>One after another, the children popped in and out of the bath. She tried, unsuccessfully, to coax them to bed. It was after 9 p.m., but she made herself a cup of coffee, hoping she might actually get to drink it before it got cold.\\r\\n<br>Just before 10 p.m., her phone buzzed with a text. It was not her husband, who was out drinking with clients. It was another mother, asking for a breakfast play date the next morning, while their husbands would be sleeping in.\\r\\n<p>Ms. Nishimasa then got back to work, reviewing the preschool journals. In a final burst, she zipped the vacuum cleaner around the living room.\\r\\n<br>Eventually, they all crammed into the master bedroom, the children squirming acrobatically.\\r\\n<br>\u201cI\u2019m fed up!\u201d Haruki chirped.\\r\\n<br>\u201cI\u2019m fed up too,\u201d Ms. Nishimasa responded, good-naturedly. \u201cLet\u2019s sleep!\u201d\\r\\n<br>The house finally quieted down close to 11 p.m. Her husband was still not home.\\r\\n<p>\u201cThe ones who work long hours get the promotions,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the bosses have full-time housewives.\u201d\\r\\n<p>\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"world.0.txt\",\"id\":-634690071},{\"title\":\"Trilobites: Flying Squirrels That Glow Pink in the Dark\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"While ultraviolet fluorescence is common in birds, butterflies and sea creatures, scientists haven\u2019t often observed it in mammals.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>One spring night in Wisconsin, John Martin, a biologist, was in his backyard with an ultraviolet flashlight.

After examining more than 100 specimens of flying squirrels across two museum collections and spotting five more squirrels under UV light in the wild, the researchers and their colleagues reported surprising results last week in the Journal of Mammalogy: The pink is real.\\r\\n<p>[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\\r\\n<br>Three different species of flying squirrel \u2014 southern, northern and Humboldt\u2019s flying squirrel \u2014 turned that color under ultraviolet illumination. \\r\\n<br>What the flying squirrels get out of it is still a mystery. Confirming that the squirrels are even capable of seeing in ultraviolet wavelengths will require additional study, Ms. Kohler said.\\r\\n<br>While ultraviolet fluorescence in mammals has not been closely studied, it is not unheard-of in other parts of the animal kingdom. \\r\\n<br>Birds and butterflies have many brilliant markings that are usually invisible to humans, who can\u2019t see ultraviolet wavelengths except under special lighting, but that are easily spotted by other members of their species. Fluorescence is common in the oceans, too.\\r\\n<br>Studies have found that birds may use fluorescent markings when choosing a mate, and fish flash at other members of their species while darting through reefs. \\r\\n<p>The researchers have some hypotheses concerning what\u2019s behind the squirrels\u2019 Day-Glo displays. Ultraviolet rays are abundant during the dawn and dusk periods when the squirrels are moving around. So it is reasonable to expect that the fluorescence is visible to other organisms even when there are no biologists with UV flashlights in the vicinity.\\r\\n<br>The vivid pink color might have evolved to confuse the owls who prey on the squirrels. Those birds of prey fluoresce in precisely the same hue themselves; a flying squirrel may look, superficially at least, like a flying owl.\\r\\n<br>Or, if it\u2019s confirmed that the squirrels see UV, the color might have something to do with mating or signaling to other flying squirrels.\\r\\n<br>\u201cIt could also just be not ecologically significant to the species,\u201d Ms. Kohler said, noting that future work will delve into the question. \u201cIt could just be a cool color that they happen to produce.\u201d\\r\\n<p>\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"science.0.txt\",\"id\":1125083330},{\"title\":\"As Pelvic Mesh Settlements Near $8 Billion, Women Question Lawyers\u2019 Fees\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"More than 100,000 women are resolving claims against companies that made pelvic mesh products to treat urinary problems. Lawyers have found ways to take big chunks of their payouts.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>When Sherise Grant filed a claim against the manufacturer of her pelvic mesh implant, she hoped to use the money from a settlement to pay for its removal.\\r\\n<br>Ms. Grant, 51, was among the millions of women around the globe whose urinary problems were treated with pelvic mesh. But not only has the surgically implanted device done little to help her, it frequently causes Ms. Grant discomfort, including pain during sex with her husband.\\r\\n<br>But the settlement wasn\u2019t enough. After lawyers\u2019 fees and other expenses, the $12,000 payout was whittled away to only $3,500.\\r\\n<br>Ms. Grant said she had called her lawyer\u2019s office to discuss those fees, and gotten nowhere. \u201cThey won\u2019t let me talk to the attorney,\u201d said Ms. Grant, of Hemet, Calif. \u201cI just want everything to be fair. I think they took way more than they should have.\u201d\\r\\n<p>Litigation over pelvic mesh, also called transvaginal mesh, ranks as one of the biggest mass tort cases in United States history, in terms of claims filed, number of corporate defendants and settlement dollars. Seven medical device manufacturers, including Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson, are paying nearly $8 billion to resolve the claims of more than 100,000 women.\\r\\n<br>A decade ago, doctors were quick to implant synthetic mesh to deal with health issues caused by a woman\u2019s bladder pressing against her vagina. But then women began complaining of complications like bleeding and searing pain. Lawyers aggressively advertised for women who had received mesh implants, and they signed up women by the thousands to file claims against the device manufacturers.\\r\\n<br>The result is a supersized federal court litigation that hasn\u2019t paid off as expected \u2014 the average settlement is less than $60,000, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times and interviews with more than a dozen women. That is less than settlements reached in other mass torts, even though the jury verdicts some women have won in pelvic mesh cases suggest the figure should be higher.\\r\\n<br>And those settlements are worth a lot less after the lawyers take their shares and other fees \u2014 cuts that became unusually hefty even for the world of mass tort litigation.\\r\\n<br>Retainer agreements and confidential documents permit some lawyers to take 40 percent of each settlement, and in some cases 45 percent. And generous expense provisions allow some firms to add costs not only for meals and hotel stays but travel by private plane. Some lawyers have found yet another way to pad their bottom lines: Hire companies they have a financial interest in to review a client\u2019s medical records, a crucial part of assessing the potential value of a claim.\\r\\n<p>Now some women are considering suing their lawyers over how their cases were handled. Lawyers have begun scouting for women willing to sue, and a Dallas firm has set up a website seeking women who feel their lawyers didn\u2019t drive a hard enough bargain.\\r\\n<br>\u201cEight billion dollars sounds like a lot in theory, but once you start divvying it up, it\u2019s less so,\u201d said Elizabeth Burch, a professor at the University of Georgia School of Law who specializes in studying mass tort litigation and is surveying women for their views on the litigation to be used in a study.\\r\\n<br>Lawyers in the mesh litigation defended their work. They said women with more severe injuries, which required the mesh to be removed in sometimes risky procedures, received the most money.\\r\\n<br>\u201cWe did everything possible to get as many cases to trial as possible,\u201d said Clayton Clark, a partner with Clark Love & Hutson, which settled thousands of complaints and was involved in a half-dozen jury trials. \u201cYou see these giant verdicts in a number of places, and that sort of skews the thought process.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Mr. Clark, whose firm used a retainer agreement that gives it the right to \u201clease private aircrafts\u201d and employ a medical records review firm it had an ownership stake in, said the expenses charged to clients were fair. He said the fees were fully disclosed and generally reviewed by a special master working for the court.\\r\\n<br>The medical records review firm was not profitable and has since closed, Mr. Clark added. \u201cThere was no potential for double-dipping,\u201d he said.\\r\\n<br>Pelvic mesh litigation began in earnest in 2011, the year the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about complications with some products. Studies have shown at least 15 percent of women who had mesh implants encountered problems, and more are expected to develop them in coming years. The F.D.A. is continuing to evaluate the situation and is scheduled to hold a hearing on Feb. 12 on the \u201crisks and benefits\u201d of pelvic mesh. Though the device has not been banned, some manufacturers have removed versions of it from the market.\\r\\n<p>Settlement details are often kept confidential by gag orders, but some women have spoken out about the offers they received.\\r\\n<br>Michelle Hedgcoth, 43, who received her settlement in 2014, said she was fortunate that her $140,000 payout was at the higher end of the scale. But she said the implant and the surgery to remove it left her with permanent injuries and a compromised immune system because parts of the mesh are \u201cembedded\u201d in her body.\\r\\n<br>Ms. Hedgcoth, who lives in Manteca, Calif., with her husband and two teenage children, said that after fees and expenses, she had received about $50,000.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThe money we are being offered is not enough for the rest of our lives,\u201d said Ms. Hedgcoth, who had to leave her job at a bill collecting company because of her injuries. She is now on disability.\\r\\n<br>Mass tort litigations can be difficult to compare. The complications experienced by patients can vary, and so can their outcomes at trial. But the mesh settlements are notable because of their size relative to the awards granted by juries, lawyers and experts said.\\r\\n<br>To date, 32 women have gone to trial in state or federal court, and 24 have obtained verdicts against mesh manufacturers totaling $345 million, for an average award of $14 million, according to court filings.\\r\\n<br>Ms. Burch said a 40 percent fee \u2014 at the high end of personal injury fees \u2014 might be justified for those cases, which went to trial and yielded multimillion-dollar verdicts. But for simply settling cases, that rate is on the high side, she said.\\r\\n<p>The settlement a decade ago over complications associated with the pain medication Vioxx is a good measuring stick, Ms. Burch said. Merck, the drug\u2019s manufacturer, created a nearly $5 billion fund, which gave an average award of $147,000 to more than 30,000 litigants. The judge in that case capped the legal fees at 32 percent.\\r\\n<br>And higher fees are coming out of smaller settlements: Compared with other medical device settlements, the $60,000 average for mesh cases is on the low end. In 2015, Biomet paid an average of about $79,000 to settle just under 2,000 claims from people who had faulty hip implants, according to court filings. Six years ago, Johnson & Johnson settled claims arising from its flawed hip implant product for $2.5 billion \u2014 or roughly $250,000 a person.\\r\\n<br>In one pelvic mesh agreement between Boston Scientific and 3,400 women, the average payout before fees was $53,000, documents show. Just 800 had offers of $100,000 or more, while roughly half received offers of $13,000 or less. And in a $244.7 million settlement negotiated last year between Johnson & Johnson and 4,000 women, the average offer was $59,000, according to court documents.\\r\\n<br>Henry Garrard, a lawyer with Blasingame, Burch, Garrard & Ashley, an Athens, Ga., law firm that handled both trials and settlements and another firm that sometimes uses a private plane, said focusing on average settlements was \u201cmisleading\u201d and ignored all the work the lawyers had done. Women who did not have the mesh removed got smaller offers because their injuries were less severe, he said.\\r\\n<br>Settlements in mesh cases have tended to be negotiated for a few thousand women at a time, as opposed to one big global deal. Most of the bulk settlements have played out in federal court under the supervision of a judge in West Virginia.\\r\\n<br>One lawyer who both took cases to trial and handled settlements said he believed many lawyers who settled cases in federal court took on too many clients to properly investigate their claims and push for adequate settlements.\\r\\n<br>\u201cNever in the field of mass tort litigation has there been such a yawning gap between success in the courtroom and failure at the settlement table,\u201d said Shanin Specter, whose Philadelphia firm, Kline & Specter, has won more than $140 million in jury verdicts in mesh cases.\\r\\n<p>On Thursday, Mr. Specter\u2019s firm scored one of its biggest courtroom victories yet \u2014 a $41 million verdict against Johnson & Johnson.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Specter said he had settled about 1,500 cases at an average of $75,000, and estimated the average settlement reached in the federal court cases was closer to $40,000.\\r\\n<br>Given what he called the \u201cpuny\u201d size of those settlements, Mr. Specter argued in court filings that lawyers should take less in so-called common benefit fees \u2014 up to 5 percent of the $8 billion that will be shared among the firms that did the most work on the federal litigation. But Judge Joseph Goodwin of Federal District Court in Charleston, W.Va., rejected that argument on Wednesday and approved the 5 percent fee request.\\r\\n<br>That pool of money \u2014 roughly $366 million \u2014 was taken out of the settlements before final checks are cut to clients, and will be split among nearly 100 firms in addition to the fees the clients paid directly.\\r\\n<br>Some law firms getting a big piece of the common benefit fund have said they will reduce the average fee they are charging individual clients to 36 percent. But that rate is still higher than the cap in the Vioxx case.\\r\\n<br>Ms. Burch, the professor surveying women involved in the cases, said some had told her that they felt pressured to accept a settlement and were not aware they could pursue their own lawsuits instead.\\r\\n<br>Barbara Shepard, 53, is considering doing just that.\\r\\n<br>She rejected a $100,000 offer because, she said, she would have been left with almost nothing after deducting lawyers\u2019 fees and repaying the high-interest loan she took out to cover a mesh removal operation.\\r\\n<p>Ms. Shepard, who lives in Bradenton, Fla., and drives a school bus, said that her loan carried an interest rate of about 50 percent, and that she would owe $69,000 to the finance firm. She is considering suing the device manufacturer and replacing her lawyers.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThe mesh didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d said Ms. Shepard, who had mesh implanted to treat frequent urination. \u201cGetting the mesh out has made it worse.\u201d\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"business.1.txt\",\"id\":1229292121},{\"title\":\"As Chances of No-Deal Brexit Rise, British Companies Scramble to Prepare\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"A lack of clarity over the terms of Britain\u2019s looming departure from the European Union has British businesses stockpiling products and components, and delaying new investments.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>TELFORD, England \u2014 Filtermist, a company flush with business across Europe, is scrambling to fix a problem whose contours are maddeningly unknown.

Investment in the British auto industry plunged by nearly half last year as companies waited to see how Brexit would play out, a leading trade association said this week.\\r\\n<p>That uncertainty is intensifying in the face of an epic stalemate. Parliament voted down an unpopular exit deal that Prime Minister Theresa May had negotiated with European leaders. Some lawmakers oppose Mrs. May\u2019s agreement because it takes Britain out of the European common marketplace; others because it ties Britain too closely to Europe.\\r\\n<p>Parliament may yet approve Mrs. May\u2019s deal \u2014 she survived a critical vote Tuesday that could have delayed Brexit \u2014 especially if the primary alternative is a tumultuous no-deal departure. Britain might extend the deadline, hold another referendum on the question of leaving the European Union or even call the whole thing off. But barring the emergence of a majority behind a negotiated arrangement, Britain will crash out.\\r\\n<br>That could profoundly alter the European single market, a free trade area running from Ireland to Greece. Customs checks would almost surely be revived at British and European ports, bringing paperwork, inspections and other bureaucratic elements not likely to speed up the transit of goods.\\r\\n<br>Many companies that trade across the English Channel have been planning for a messy divorce while hoping to be pleasantly surprised by a smoother separation.\\r\\n<p>Multinational banks now depend on rights within the European market that allow them to legally use offices in Britain to serve customers on the Continent. Brexit is likely to end that arrangement, so global banks have been shifting thousands of jobs from Britain to European banking centers.\\r\\n<br>Novo Nordisk, a Danish pharmaceutical company, provides more than half the insulin used by British residents with diabetes. The company makes most of its insulin near Copenhagen, trucking the product to the French port of Calais, where ferries carry it to the English port of Dover.\\r\\n<br>Normally, Novo Nordisk holds seven weeks\u2019 worth of stock at cold storage facilities in Britain. As the risk of a no-deal Brexit has risen, the company has increased that stockpile to a 16-week supply, said Pinder Sahota, the drugmaker\u2019s vice president for the United Kingdom.

The supplier is obliged to deliver parts to Nissan every half-hour or face fines.\\r\\n<p>Pressmark has increased its reserves of steel by half to ensure that it has enough to last 15 days. The coils lie in a corner of the factory, on a grease-stained patch of concrete.\\r\\n<br>The company borrowed 200,000 pounds (about $263,000) to finance the additional steel. This, combined with a dip in British auto sales, prompted Mr. Nollett to delay buying newer presses.\\r\\n<br>\u201cWhy would we want to invest in a plant if we are going to lose volume?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the uncertainty over Brexit.\u201d\\r\\n<br>At Filtermist, which employs about 90 people in Britain, Brexit has posed a distraction from the company\u2019s surging growth. Sales increased by nearly a third from 2017 to 2018, as factories around the world sought to protect workers from the hazards of industrial air. Filtermist automated part of its production and found jobs for the workers displaced by robots.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Stansfield, the chief executive, does not lack for other worries, among them an economic slowdown in China. But Brexit presents an especially acute danger: Manufacturers could leave Britain for industrial areas in Europe, especially in the key industries of aerospace and automotive. This was the point the Airbus chief brought home.\\r\\n<br>\u201cHe voiced what many people were thinking,\u201d Mr. Stansfield said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to affect us.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Filtermist is owned by a Swedish conglomerate. Mr. Stansfield has grown accustomed to phone calls from incredulous Swedish board members who assume that he, by dint of being English, must be able to divine the mysteries of Brexit.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThey call us and ask, \u2018What\u2019s happening? What\u2019s going to happen?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we have to tell them, \u2018We don\u2019t know.\u2019\u201d\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"health.4.txt\",\"id\":411863084},{\"title\":\"Times Insider: An Inmate\u2019s Death in Jail and a Journalist\u2019s Search for Why\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"For the county prosecutor, the case was closed.

Instantly, the journalist\u2019s ever-present question pinged through my head: Why?\\r\\n<br>Why was no one charged in the death of Lamekia Dockery, which occurred while she was in custody at the Goshen, Ind., work-release center? And a much bigger question: Why did a 36-year-old woman jailed for a probation violation, for shoplifting at a Walmart, die?\\r\\n<br>I was posted to The New York Times\u2019s Chicago bureau, on loan for a month to the National desk from the Metro section, where I cover the intersection of the president and New York City. Most national correspondents are posted to one of our 15 bureaus, each of which covers a swath of states. Every morning, my colleague Mitch Smith did the painstaking work of reading about 200 news sites and sending a list of the most interesting stories to our many correspondents across the country. When the story from Elkhart came along in his daily roundup, I was intrigued and disturbed.\\r\\n<p>My first call was to Vicki E. Becker, the Elkhart County prosecutor, to ask why no one would be charged in the death, which was a result, according to the coroner\u2019s office, of sepsis from an untreated perforated ulcer. As I later reported, she said the guards were not culpable because \u201cnone of them expressed any belief that a stomachache could result in her death.\u201d\\r\\n<br>For Ms. Becker, the case was closed. But for a reporter, the story of how Ms. Dockery died still needed to be told.\\r\\n<br>With the blessing of Monica Davey, the Chicago bureau chief, I jumped into my rental car and sped to Goshen to find out more. By the edge of Rock Run Creek, I found the work-release center, and outside it inmates hustling back from their jobs at area factories to make curfew. Nevertheless, when I asked them what happened, many stopped to speak to me, risking penalization for being tardy.\\r\\n<br>Ms. Dockery had died over the course of six days, begging for help from guards who did not listen in the open-ward jail. Her fellow inmates all heard her screams, and they wanted the world to know.\\r\\n<p>Around the corner from the center is St. Mark\u2019s United Methodist Church, where prisoners in good standing can attend services. They crowded the sanctuary with their babies, partners and other visiting family members as I joined them for prayers one Sunday. The week Ms. Dockery died \u2014 the pastor, Tony Brinson, told me \u2014 inmates stood up during services to speak of what they had witnessed, many in tears. I interviewed several as we sat in the pews; each was wearing a GPS-tracking ankle monitor.\\r\\n<p>Other inmates, such as Nini Mora, who used her own money to buy Ms. Dockery Tylenol \u2014 some of the only medical care she received during her ordeal \u2014 were not eligible for outside privileges. So I interviewed Ms. Mora over Facebook Messenger, asking her to record her thoughts as diary entries and send me the audio clips. I also spoke with Ms. Dockery\u2019s mother, her sisters and her aunt, who all told me of their searing loss.\\r\\n<br>Eyewitness testimony, I knew, was not enough. So I reached out to the Elkhart Board of Commissioners, which runs corrections in the county. Not once was I allowed to speak with a member; over the months I was working on the article, the board responded solely through a lawyer, Michael DeBoni of the Goshen law firm Yoder, Ainlay, Ulmer & Buckingham.\\r\\n<br>Typically, a reporter and a representative of a public entity will engage in on-background conversations to answer simple questions of fact, such as: How many inmates are there? And how many guards? But Mr. DeBoni refused to ever get on the phone with me. Nearly every snippet of conversation was conducted through formal legal letters, each delayed by several days.\\r\\n<br>It was such an unusual correspondence that I have since initiated a freedom of information request to find out how many hours Mr. DeBoni\u2019s firm spent working on responses to my questions and the hourly rate the firm has charged the county. (I may report back when and if that request is fulfilled.)\\r\\n<br>Nonetheless, little by little, my editor Shaila Dewan and I found that the official picture of what Ms. Dockery endured was emerging. It came via documents I obtained through the Indiana Access to Public Records Act.\\r\\n<br>The contents were so startling that, as I read the documents back in The Times\u2019s headquarters in New York, I gasped, startling my colleagues beside me.\\r\\n<br>What the inmates had told me \u2014 that when Ms. Dockery became irate at not receiving medical help she was put in solitary confinement, or \u201cthe box\u201d; that when she kicked the door there, she was shackled \u2014 was backed up completely in corrections officers\u2019 logs. And there was more: When she went to find help from a caseworker, she was punished. When she vomited into a cup of noodle soup in a day room, she was castigated. When she said she was dying, she was ignored.\\r\\n<br>Ms. Dockery\u2019s death was likely preventable. But she died because, experts told me, as a drug user, a black woman and an incarcerated person, her human anguish was dismissed. My hope is that, by telling her story, Lamekia Dockery can finally be seen and heard.\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"health.8.txt\",\"id\":-1361980079},{\"title\":\"It\u2019s Still Cold. Our Midwest Readers Tell Us How to Make the Most of the Polar Vortex.\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"Our readers found novel ways to entertain themselves in weather so cold, even the mail was not delivered.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>As the polar vortex bore down on the Midwest on Wednesday and Thursday, many residents heeded the warnings of officials to hunker down indoors and stay there. But that doesn\u2019t mean there was no fun to be had, inside or even outside (with proper layers, of course). \\r\\n<br>While frigid temperatures set in, some took the opportunity to hone their soup-making skills and introduce their kids to beloved movies. Some even used their phones to, of all things, talk. Others went cross-country skiing or hiking, and one ventured outdoors just to freeze his pants (not the ones he was wearing). \\r\\n<br>Below, readers give their recommendations for the best ways to brave the elements, mostly from the safety of one\u2019s own home. They have been condensed and edited for clarity.\\r\\n<h2>Perform science experiments outside\\r\\n<p>Polar Science Experiments: Ice bubbles! Recipe: 1\/2 cup Dawn dish detergent, 1\/4 cup corn syrup and 1 1\/2 cups water. After you make the mixture, chill it in the freezer. \\r\\n<p>We used a straw and found that a bubble suspended on the straw works better than one blown on the plate. Isaac and I enjoy science! \\r\\n<h2>Bundle up and take a hike\\r\\n<br>This is winter. Take a hike. I went for a three-mile walk with my lab. He rolled in the snow, chased a squirrel, stood at the top of a hill facing the wind. He loved it and so did I. \\r\\n<br>If you don\u2019t get out, then cabin fever sets in. And winter is so quiet. How could you not want to stand in the woods and wonder at the beauty of it all? No bad weather, just bad clothes.\\r\\n<h2>Have a potluck with neighbors\\r\\n<br>My husband and I invited our neighbors over for a polar vortex potluck, and we ate and drank and talked till the wee hours! It definitely broke the monotony of the two of us staring at each other. \\r\\n<br>Invite people over who live close by but that you might not know well. It will make the time fly by.\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<h2>Freeze your pants for a laugh\\r\\n<br>Freeze some pants outside. It only takes a few minutes (you won\u2019t freeze) and it\u2019s just a silly thing to help make light of a seriously cold day.\\r\\n<h2>Watch a movie marathon \\r\\n<br>This is a perfect time to introduce my daughters \u2014 Lila, 10, and Mya, 7 \u2014 to the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d trilogy. There are movies I love that I want to introduce my daughters to, but we never seem to have long stretches of time to do this. Snow days are perfect for this. \\r\\n<br>Also, every time my kids complain about being bored, I make them put a toy in the Goodwill box. \u201cIf you\u2019re bored, that means you\u2019re tired of the toys we have, and it\u2019s time to get rid of them,\u201d I tell them. That stops the complaining and gets rid of stuff; it\u2019s a win-win. \\r\\n<h2>Invent new games\\r\\n<br>Invent new games. We have one called \u201cWill She Poop on the Stoop?\u201d We bet if our dog, Zoey, will make it past the stoop to do her business. Five dollars says she\u2019ll poop on the stoop. \\r\\n<br>The result: Zoey just sort of stood there in terror, while we watched from a window to see if she would venture past the stoop. I\u2019m out five dollars so far. \\r\\n<h2>Spend more time on each pose\\r\\n<br>While I know I should not rush through my yoga practice, I frequently do so I can move on to the next thing on my to-do list. Wednesday while marooned inside, I spent more time on each pose, conscious of breath and body throughout. The polar vortex turns out to be a teacher.\\r\\n<h2>Take a walk (in lots of layers)\\r\\n<br>I just walked four blocks to get lunch at our bar, mostly to say I did it. I was wearing a wool union suit, long underwear, two shirts, a wool sweater, wool legwarmers, two pairs of wool socks, a long down coat, gloves, leather hunting mittens, a balaclava, a neck gaiter, a wool hat, a scarf and sunglasses to trap my breath and keep my eyeballs from freezing. It\u2019s sunny and beautiful out, so it was a cozy walk!\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<h2>Use the phone to \u2014 wait for it \u2014 talk \\r\\n<br>The weather is so bad that I am using the phone to actually have a conversation with friends. I\u2019m using a phone to talk. It\u2019s like junior high all over again, except instead of talking about junior high things, my friend and I had to confirm we had the same brand of Brazil nuts from Whole Foods, and whether or not the nuts smell funny. Adulthood.\\r\\n<h2>Go cross-country skiing\\r\\n<br>I went cross-country skiing on Wednesday and got really warm. Just keeping yourself moving and having enough layers prevents the coldness. I\u2019m originally from Finland, and as a Finn I\u2019m just enjoying the real winter but amazed how poorly the coldness is handled here and sorry for those who are suffering because of it.\\r\\n<br>Natural materials like wool are warmer than synthetic like fleece. Also, air between the clothes increases a warm feeling. You can wear two gloves or two hats at the same time, too. Drinking something hot during the day helps gives a nice warm feeling from inside.\\r\\n<h2>Cook hot soup\\r\\n<br>Soup-making! Work on some sweet knife skills, turn your stove on, get your house warm \u2014 and yummy, warm soup at the end of it!\\r\\n<h2>Play cards and hit the gym\\r\\n<br>Rather than watching TV like we always do, my girlfriend and I played cards (Rummy 500). It\u2019s been a lovely way to avoid cabin fever.\\r\\n<h2>Prepare a warm dish and a mixed drink\\r\\n<br>This lemony chicken spring veggie soup has been soothing to make and comforting to eat when facing another day stranded inside.\\r\\n<br>I\u2019m pairing it with a gin and tonic, while watching \u201cNarcos: Mexico\u201d on Netflix. Gotta make the best of it!\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<h2>Checking out the snowmobilers\\r\\n<br>I had cabin fever Wednesday and went outside for a two-block walk (bundled up for it), and saw people still going into their usual routines. I dress in layers with long-sleeved fleece shirts, jeans or fleece-lined leggings, three pairs of socks, lined gloves, and I use hand and toe warmers in gloves and boots.\\r\\n<br>I wanted to capture the natural beauty of the Northwoods in the midst of the polar vortex, and maybe see the snowmobilers (a trail runs behind my building on a lake) since that's normal this time of year \u2014 our town is known for year-round tourism and most of Chicago comes here to vacation. \\r\\n<br>Northern Wisconsin is used to living through this type of weather, but this is extreme even for here.\\r\\n<h2>Most of all, don\u2019t panic\\r\\n<br>There was some fairly impressive wind Tuesday night here near the southern shore of Lake Erie. I\u2019m able to work from home, so this polar vortex basically involves bundling up a bit, staying inside and waiting for warmer weather to return on Friday and Saturday. We had a similar but colder arctic blast a few years back that left me sitting in front of a fireplace in warm clothes, with a cup of tea and a book. \\r\\n<br>In short, don\u2019t panic, it will be over soon.\\r\\n<br>A note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.\\r\\n<br>Follow the @ReaderCenter on Twitter for more coverage highlighting your perspectives and experiences and for insight into how we work.\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"science.13.txt\",\"id\":489669537},{\"title\":\"Goldman Sachs Suggests Current and Former Executives Could Lose Money Over 1MDB\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"The investment bank\u2019s board adopted a provision to claw back, or reduce, some of the pay packages they received last year, depending on the outcome of a federal inquiry into a fraud in Malaysia.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>The fallout for Goldman Sachs from a scandal tied to a Malaysian investment fund could mean lower pay for several senior executives at the Wall Street bank, including the chief executive, David Solomon, and his predecessor, Lloyd Blankfein.\\r\\n<br>The bank\u2019s board, in approving year-end compensation for Mr. Solomon and Mr. Blankfein, adopted a provision giving it the ability to claw back, or reduce some of that pay package, depending on the outcome of a federal investigation into the fraud at the 1Malaysia Development Berhad fund, known as 1MDB.\\r\\n<br>The 1MDB investigation represents one of the most significant scandals to hit Goldman in years, which has taken a reputational hit in Malaysia and elsewhere in Asia. As the American authorities continue to build a case, prosecutors in Malaysia have already accused Goldman, which raised money for the $6 billion fund, of enriching itself at the expense of the Malaysian public.\\r\\n<br>The decision by bank\u2019s board to potentially claw back compensation, which was disclosed in a regulatory filing on Friday, reveals a degree of uncertainty within Goldman as to how the criminal investigation will shake out. The new provision is more specific than an existing rule that allows the board to claw back compensation from executives.\\r\\n<p>The bank is looking at paying several billion dollars in fines and restitution. Toward the end of last year, Goldman began setting aside money for the case, which is being pursued by federal prosecutors and bank regulators, as well as authorities in Malaysia.\\r\\n<br>Goldman is eager to avoid a more punitive resolution, like a deferred prosecution agreement. In a deferred prosecution, the authorities ultimately decline to pursue charges if a company complies with certain requirements such as overhauling its compliance operation and paying hefty fines.\\r\\n<br>One former top Goldman banker has already pleaded guilty to federal charges in connection with the investigation, and a junior banker has also been charged. Federal prosecutors have said that at least $2.7 billion was looted from the fund by people close to Malaysia\u2019s former prime minister, Najib Razak. A financier, Jho Low, who was charged in the fraud, is a fugitive believed to be in China.\\r\\n<br>Goldman Sachs was the primary banker for 1MDB, helping to sell nearly $6 billion in bonds. The bank has said it regretted the fraud carried out by its former partner, Tim Leissner, but has said it followed appropriate procedures and was cooperating with the investigation. The bank has said the scheme was carried out by rogue employees who deceived management at Goldman.\\r\\n<br>The bank said the clawback provision would give the board the \u201cflexibility to reduce the size of the award\u201d to senior executives, if necessary, as a result of the 1MDB case. Mr. Solomon replaced Mr. Blankfein as Goldman\u2019s chief executive on Oct. 1; Mr. Blankfein stayed on as chairman of the board through the end of the year.\\r\\n<p>The board set Mr. Solomon\u2019s total compensation package for 2018 at $23 million, a $2 million increase from the prior year. Mr. Blankfein\u2019s total compensation for 2018 was $20.5 million.\\r\\n<br>The filing on Friday seemed to be aimed, in part, at Mr. Blankfein. The board said it would \u201cdefer its decision\u201d on some awards for its long-term incentive plan for retired executives until more information is known about the investigation.\\r\\n<br>Under most compensation plans, top executives are awarded a bonus but then receive it in parts over the next three to five years. The system allows boards to \u201cclaw back\u201d pay before the executive receives it, in cases where missteps have occurred.\\r\\n<br>But compensation specialists said it was rare for a board to announce that it might take back pay for a specific cause.\\r\\n<br>\u201cIt\u2019s very unusual,\u201d said Alan Johnson of Johnson Associates, a compensation consulting firm. \u201cThey wanted to send a signal.\u201d\\r\\n<br>The forfeiture and clawback provision could cover about five top current and former executives at the bank, said a person familiar with the matter but not authorized to speak publicly on board matters. The holdback on the long-term compensation plan could apply to up to three retired executives, including Mr. Blankfein, Michael Sherwood and J. Michael Evans, the person said.\\r\\n<br>The grants under the long-term compensation plan go back to 2011, around the time Goldman began underwriting bond deals for 1MDB.\\r\\n<p>One former executive, Gary Cohn, who left Goldman to join the Trump administration, is not affected by the decision to defer compensation because he received a lump payout when he left the bank, the person familiar with the matter said.\\r\\n<br>The scandal has threatened to tarnish the tenure of Mr. Blankfein, who helped navigate Goldman through the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. Blankfein attended at least one meeting with Mr. Low, in December 2012. That meeting was held at Goldman\u2019s headquarters in Lower Manhattan.\\r\\n<br>The meeting, which was facilitated by Mr. Leissner, took place even though others at Goldman had expressed wariness about Mr. Low.\\r\\n<br>Speaking at a conference in November, when the charges against the two former Goldman employees were made public, Mr. Blankfein said, \u201cThese are guys who evaded our safeguards, and lie.\u201d\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"business.2.txt\",\"id\":-1709632295},{\"title\":\"Gigantic Cavity in Antarctica Glacier Is a Product of Rapid Melting, Study Finds\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"Scientists discovered an underwater cavity with an area about two-thirds of Manhattan in the Thwaites Glacier. They say it\u2019s a direct impact of climate change.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>The Thwaites Glacier on Antarctica\u2019s western coast has long been considered one of the most unstable on the continent. Now, scientists are worried about the discovery of an enormous underwater cavity that will probably speed up the glacier\u2019s decay.\\r\\n<br>The cavity is about two-thirds the area of Manhattan and nearly 1,000 feet tall, according to a study released Wednesday by NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The hulking chamber is large enough to have contained about 14 billion tons of ice \u2014 most of which the researchers say melted in three years.\\r\\n<br>The Thwaites Glacier, which is about the size of Florida, holds enough ice that if it all melted, it would raise the world\u2019s oceans by over two feet, a change that would threaten many coastal cities. Climate scientists tend to watch this glacier closely, usually alongside the nearby Pine Island Glacier, which is also flowing rapidly into the Amundsen Sea.\\r\\n<br>Rising sea levels, among the most obvious threats of global warming, are caused by the melting of ice sheets, as well as the thermal expansions of the ocean. A separate study released last week found that Antarctica was contributing more to rising sea levels than previously thought.\\r\\n<p>The Thwaites Glacier is one of the epicenters of this rapid deterioration. Already, the glacier is responsible for about 4 percent of the world\u2019s rising sea levels, according to a NASA news release. \\r\\n<br>The size and shape of water-filled cavities like the one discovered play an important role in the melting of glaciers, said Pietro Milillo, the NASA study\u2019s lead author. A cavity is created by relatively warm oceanwater melting the ice shelf. As the glacier becomes exposed to more warm-water currents, the ice will probably melt faster.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThis is the ocean eating away at the ice,\u201d said Eric Rignot, an author of the study and a professor of Earth system science at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cIt\u2019s a direct impact of climate change on the glacier.\u201d\\r\\n<br>NASA\u2019s study found that the ice shelf in that area melted at a rate of more than 650 feet per year between 2014 and 2017. That is enormous by Antarctica\u2019s standards, Professor Rignot said.\\r\\n<br>Before the researchers collected this data, they had no idea the cavity existed, said Dr. Milillo, a radar scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The first clues of the cavern\u2019s existence were revealed about three years ago in data collected by NASA\u2019s radar technology, which is flown above the glacier on airplanes and can penetrate deep below the surface of the ice.\\r\\n<p>Sridhar Anandakrishnan, a professor of geosciences and glaciology at Penn State who was not involved in the study, said that much of the area beneath glaciers\u2019 ice sheets remains a mystery to scientists. But the size and shape of underwater cavities, including the detailed bumps and hollows in the ice, are important in forming accurate models for the rate at which glaciers are melting and will melt in the future.\\r\\n<br>Professor Anandakrishnan said in a phone interview that he returned this week from a monthlong expedition in Antarctica, where he spent time living on and studying the Thwaites Glacier. He lived in a tent and traveled part of the time on skis, studying the mystery of what lies beneath the ice.\\r\\n<br>\u201cIt\u2019s flat and white and there\u2019s nobody there,\u201d he said of the glacier.\\r\\n<br>The gigantic cavity revealed in the study is at the junction between grounded and floating ice. It is shaped like an elongated irregular oval, not unlike the island of Manhattan.\\r\\n<br>There is still a lot more beneath the surface for scientists to understand, but studies like this have made headway, Professor Anandakrishnan said. That is because of improved tools for determining the physical properties beneath the ice, as well as a heightened urgency surrounding the melting glaciers in western Antarctica.\\r\\n<br>\u201cWe\u2019re just now starting to get a handle on that complexity,\u201d he said.\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"science.11.txt\",\"id\":326879815},{\"title\":\"What the \u201810-Year Challenge\u2019 Might Say About You, and Me\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"It couldn\u2019t have been easier: Post an early profile photo on Facebook from 2009 next to a recent one \u2014 as proof positive of how you\u2019ve aged or, miraculously, not aged.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>Earlier this month out of nowhere came the \u201cHow Hard Did Aging Hit You Challenge\u201d that flooded Instagram and Facebook.

One he called \u201cage defying.\u201d Positive call outs would appeal to a person\u2019s \u201cpure vanity, with a superficial, narcissistic, ageist bent.\u201d The other he called \u201ccelebrating aging,\u201d or embracing an older self, wrinkles be damned. For those people, comments like \u201colder and wiser\u201d might resonate most.\\r\\n<br>Not surprisingly, actors\u2019 challenge photos got a good bit of media attention, with most falling into the \u201cage defying\u201d bucket. Reese Witherspoon uploaded two striking head shots \u2014 then and now \u2014 and wrote: \u201cTime sure does fly by when you\u2019re having fun!\u201d Most of her Twitter followers responded along the lines of: \u201cYou actually got younger. What a vision.\u201d\\r\\n<p>Amy Gorely, a director at Carolina Meadows, a retirement community in Chapel Hill, N.C., who started the \u201cBe Bold, Claim Old\u201d campaign, said such responses reflect the ageist nature of the game. \u201cThe challenge is inherently based on the societal belief that youth is the gold standard. If we look as youthful or \u2014 gasp! \u2014 better than we did 10 years ago, then society bestows value and we are \u2018successfully aging,\u2019\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cIf we do not look as good, then we failed or were hit hard.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Padma Lakshmi, the host of \u201cTop Chef,\u201d wore a tiny two-piece in her current photo, set against a \u201cbefore\u201d photo that was 20 years old. The vast majority of the comments on her photos praised her \u201cnatural beauty.\u201d But then came the naysayers: \u201cThat don\u2019t even look like the same person with her eyes lips and cheeks done,\u201d noted joshuatrophywife. Another poster quoted Vivienne Lewis, a clinical psychologist who specializes in body image: \u201cThe message seems to be: women are rising up to be strong, fearless, and vibrant \u2014 we are here for the long haul! But you\u2019ll never see us age.\u201d\\r\\n<p>Dr. Lewis told me she worries that \u201ccomparing your life now to how it was 10 years ago can leave a person feeling hopeless, helpless, depressed and anxious.\u201d I hadn\u2019t really thought about those people who weren\u2019t posting: those who might have struggled with illness, divorce, or the death of a spouse or a child, or who don\u2019t like how they\u2019ve aged (weight gain, thinning hair, wrinkles, saggy skin). \\r\\n<p>But Dr. Lewis also sees an upside: \u201cFor those who perceive it as an opportunity to showcase personal growth or enduring social relationships, it can foster an enhanced sense of well-being that can positively contribute to the collective wisdom that accompanies aging.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Still, most of the criticism of the challenge goes back to its ageism. Dr. LaBar is especially concerned about the impact of the challenge on older adults, whom he says are \u201cparticularly susceptible to the impact of negative implicit biases\u201d of ageist attitudes. He explained that \u201cin older adults, performance on memory tests and other cognitively-demanding tasks is impaired after participants had been given verbal reminders of negative aging stereotypes, like older adults are generally slow\u2019 and \u2018older adults tend to be forgetful.\u2019\u201d\\r\\n<br>But Dr. LaBar wasn\u2019t ready to write the challenge off. He told me that some people who have \u201cowned\u201d this challenge have used it to mark major life transitions\u201d \u2014 beating cancer, surviving a trauma, graduating from college. \u201cIn these cases, the challenge is used as a means of self-actualization, self-affirmation and pride, which is extremely powerful.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Maybe in joining the challenge I was \u201ccelebrating\u201d my age rather than \u201cdefying\u201d it. Yes, my skin is dryer, my hair thinner and my cheeks succumbing to gravity. Under the hood my cholesterol is higher, as is my calcium level, an indicator of heart attack risk.

She was discharged from the hospital, but instead of getting better, she recalls, she kept feeling \u201cworse and worse and worse.\u201d\\r\\n<br>Five weeks after she had her child, Ms. Leon\u2019s husband came back early from work and found her barely able to breathe. \u201cI hate to use the word panic, because so many people say if it\u2019s a woman she is just having a panic attack, but I was terrified,\u201d she said.\\r\\n<br>Her husband called 911, and she was taken to the emergency room where, after a few tests, the physicians told her there was nothing wrong with her. She went home but continued to have bouts of chest pain and kept laboring to breathe.\\r\\n<br>Things came to a head several days later, she said, when she developed \u201cthat impending doom feeling.\u201d Reluctantly, she called 911 again. Things went differently in the emergency room this time.\\r\\n<p>\u201cThere was a young woman doctor who took care of me,\u201d said Ms. Leon. \u201cHer reaction was totally different. She knew that there was something definitely wrong.\u201d\\r\\n<br>A few days later, she underwent an explorative cardiac catheterization procedure and received a devastating diagnosis: She had a critical blockage in the main artery supplying her heart. She would need emergency heart bypass surgery.\\r\\n<br>She remembers thinking at the time: \u201cAre you kidding me? I have two babies and I was going to do the whole mom thing, with playgroups and a jog stroller, and take classes. I may have tried one cigarette in my life. I didn\u2019t have cholesterol issues. I didn\u2019t have blood pressure issues.\u201d\\r\\n<br>She received what at the time was considered one of the rarest possible diagnoses: spontaneous coronary artery dissection, or SCAD. The condition occurs when one of the arteries supplying the heart with oxygen spontaneously tears open, leading to a heart attack that can sometimes be fatal. It occurs most often in women, and can be exacerbated by pregnancy.\\r\\n<br>But at the time, few doctors knew that SCAD even existed, or knew much about it. \u201cYou are never going to meet anyone else who has this,\u201d Ms. Leon remembers one doctor telling her. Another told her, \u201cYou need to move on and enjoy your children.\u201d\\r\\n<p>Her doctors also told her that the only thing she could do to avoid SCAD in the future was to never get pregnant again. But seeking to learn more about the disease that had almost taken her life, she went online and started to find other women with similar symptoms around the world.\\r\\n<br>In 2009, Ms. Leon went to the WomenHeart Science and Leadership Symposium at the Mayo Clinic, where she met Dr. Sharonne N. Hayes, a professor of cardiovascular medicine at Mayo. At that time, the largest study on SCAD included 43 patients. \u201cI walked up to Dr. Hayes and told her we had 70 people, and we wanted research,\u201d Ms. Leon recalled. \u201cShe was like, \u2018Wow.\u2019\u201d\\r\\n<br>\u201cEverything I learned about SCAD in my medical training was wrong,\u201d Dr. Hayes said.\\r\\n<br>By 2010, with the help of Dr. Hayes, and subsequently SCAD Research Inc., an organization founded by Bob Alico, who lost his wife to SCAD, Dr. Hayes devised an innovative way to do research, using online networks of far-flung patients and analyzing genetic and clinical data. \u201cWe never imagined there would be 1,000 female patients in our virtual registry,\u201d Dr. Hayes said.\\r\\n<br>That fortuitous meeting between Ms. Leon and Dr. Hayes has helped transform SCAD from being an unknown, unrecognized condition to something all physicians are taught about during medical school and in later training. SCAD is now recognized as the most common cause of heart attacks in women under 40.\\r\\n<br>Why did it take so long for physicians and researchers to recognize SCAD? The most important reason might have been that the condition predominantly affects women. \u201cWe listen less well to women,\u201d said Dr. Hayes. \u201cWe are much more likely to associate their symptoms with psychological causes.\u201d A heart attack is more likely to be fatal in a young woman than a young man, perhaps because women\u2019s cardiac symptoms are more often misattributed to anxiety or depression than men\u2019s.\\r\\n<br>The bias that many women feel they face in the clinic or the emergency room has led some, like Ms. Leon, to take action and advocate for themselves and others. \u201cPeople are activated by injustice, by unanswered questions,\u201d said Dr. Hayes\\r\\n<br>She offers this advice: \u201cDon\u2019t walk out of a doctor\u2019s office without answers. Find a doctor who is committed to listening to you and does not think they know everything about anything.\u201d\\r\\n<br>The story of SCAD underscores how much we doctors still don\u2019t understand, including about heart disease in women. Too often those in the medical profession downplay women\u2019s complaints, telling them nothing is wrong. Women are often expected to take care of others but too often neglect themselves. Indeed, women take much longer to seek medical care for a heart attack than men. As we embrace new technologies to peer ever deeper inside the human body to find answers, perhaps the better route might be simply to attend to the patient in front of us. Often what we need to do is listen.\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"health.9.txt\",\"id\":494067761},{\"title\":\"How NASA\u2019s Curiosity Rover Weighed a Mountain on Mars\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"With a bit of technical improvisation, scientists worked out that the bedrock of Mount Sharp appeared to be less dense than had been expected.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>A mountain on Mars that is almost as tall as Denali in Alaska appears to be surprisingly light, scientists reported on Thursday.\\r\\n<br>For more than four years, NASA\u2019s Curiosity rover has been exploring Mount Sharp, located within an ancient meteor impact crater known as Gale and rising more than three miles high. Now measurements of tiny changes in gravity, recorded by the rover as it climbed in elevation, could help solve the question of how the mountain formed.\\r\\n<br>The official name of the mountain is Aeolis Mons, but mission scientists have nicknamed it after Robert P. Sharp, a Mars expert who died in 2004. It consists of layer upon layer of sedimentary rock, which offer an easy-to-read history book of Martian geology. That was one of the attractions that led NASA to choose the site for the Curiosity mission, which landed on Mars in 2012.\\r\\n<br>But sedimentary rocks typically form at the bottoms of lakes and oceans, not at the tops of mountains.\\r\\n<p>Some scientists surmised that the 96-mile-wide Gale crater was once a lake that slowly filled to the brim with sediment, which was then blown away by winds, leaving Mount Sharp. Others suggested that particles blew in from other parts of the planet and piled up at the center of the crater in the shape of a mountain.\\r\\n<br>[Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.]\\r\\n<br>In the new research, published on Thursday in the journal Science, the gravity measurements indicated that the rocks beneath Curiosity were not solid but porous, lowering their density. This finding suggested that the crater was never completely filled with sediment, because the porous rocks would not have been strong enough to support all of the weight without being compressed.\\r\\n<br>That conclusion fits in with the notion that both hypotheses of Mount Sharp\u2019s formation are true in part, said Ashwin R. Vasavada, the mission\u2019s project scientist and an author of the Science paper. Its bottom may consist of carved-out lake sediments, while the top part may have built up from windblown particles.\\r\\n<br>\u201cThat\u2019s an idea that\u2019s been gaining strength,\u201d Dr. Vasavada said.\\r\\n<p>The findings were the result of a clever technical improvisation, using sensors that were intended to provide engineers with information on the status of the rover. Doing so effectively added a new scientific instrument to Curiosity, years after the rover landed on Mars.\\r\\n<br>The brainstorm came from Kevin W. Lewis, a professor of earth and planetary sciences at Johns Hopkins University and a member of the mission team. He realized that modern devices such as smartphones have chips that measure the forces of acceleration. That\u2019s how an iPhone knows to rotate the screen depending on whether you are holding it vertically or horizontally.\\r\\n<p>This kind of sensor, known as an accelerometer, can measure changes in the pull of gravity. On Earth, geologists use variations in gravity to probe for underground features such as earthquake faults and ore deposits. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be wild if we had something like that on Mars?\u201d said Dr. Lewis, the lead author of the Science paper.\\r\\n<br>Then he realized that there were indeed accelerometers on Mars. The Curiosity rover was using such devices to track the tilt of the vehicle as it moved across the surface.\\r\\n<br>Those measurements provided a record of the force of gravity on Curiosity. \u201cLuckily, the engineers had already been taking a perfect data set, basically since day one,\u201d he said.\\r\\n<br>Because the sensors were not meant for Dr. Lewis\u2019s purpose, the data were \u201cquite noisy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe data would jump around pretty severely from day to day.\u201d\\r\\n<br>After calibrating the measurements and averaging out the variations, the researchers found that gravity indeed waned slightly as Curiosity climbed about 1,000 feet in elevation. But it was less than what would have been measured if Curiosity had been hoisted 1,000 feet into the air. That is because of the additional gravitational attraction from the mass of the mountain.\\r\\n<br>The change in the force was small. For a person who weighs 150 pounds on Earth (and just 57 pounds on Mars because of the weaker gravity), climbing 1,000 feet up Mount Sharp would shed about one-tenth of an ounce.\\r\\n<p>The researchers calculated that the bedrock under Curiosity had a density of about 100 pounds per cubic foot. However, the minerals that make up the rocks were about 70 percent more dense than that. This led Dr. Lewis and his colleagues to conclude that the rocks must be porous.\\r\\n<p>John P. Grotzinger, a geology professor at the California Institute of Technology who served as the project scientist during Curiosity\u2019s first three years on Mars, said Dr. Lewis\u2019s idea to tap into the engineering data was \u201ca great example of real scientific creativity.\u201d\\r\\n<br>But he was less certain of the conclusions. \\r\\n<br>Curiosity\u2019s examination of the rocks at the surface suggest that sediment grains are tightly cemented together, not porous. Dr. Grotzinger also noted sizable swings in the gravity measurements, even when Curiosity was moving on roughly level ground. That means that the material beneath Mount Sharp might not be as uniform as assumed in the calculations by Dr. Lewis and his colleagues. The gravity data might reflect low-density geological structures deeper underground, not the properties of the Mount Sharp rocks.\\r\\n<br>\u201cYou just have to somehow invent a geologically plausible scenario,\u201d Dr. Grotzinger said. \u201cTo me, it leaves some wiggle room.\u201d\\r\\n<p>\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"science.1.txt\",\"id\":1957449218},{\"title\":\"Net Neutrality Repeal at Stake as Key Court Case Starts\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"A lawsuit challenging the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s repeal of rules meant to ensure internet users open access to all websites and services is one of several fronts in a broader battle.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>Oral arguments were presented Friday in the most prominent lawsuit challenging the federal government\u2019s repeal of broadband access rules known as net neutrality. \\r\\n<br>The Federal Communications Commission approved the rules in 2015 to ensure internet users equal and open access to all websites and services. The commission, under new leadership, rolled the rules back in 2017.\\r\\n<br>The plaintiffs in the suit, led by the internet company Mozilla and supported by 22 state attorneys general, say the commission lacked a sound legal reason for scrapping the regulations. The government was expected to argue that the rules were repealed because of the burden they imposed on broadband providers like Verizon and Comcast.\\r\\n<br>The case, before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, could wind through the courts for years. If the commission loses, it might try to rewrite its order rolling back the rules to avoid further legal challenges.\\r\\n<p>The case is just one front in the fight over net neutrality. Here are two other forums where the subject continues to be fiercely debated.\\r\\n<h2>In the States\\r\\n<br>Immediately after the commission voted to repeal the rules, state officials jumped into action. More than 30 states have introduced bills to add their own net neutrality protections. Nine, including California, New York, Rhode Island and Washington, have approved such regulations.\\r\\n<br>That means people in those states are theoretically protected against moves by companies like AT&T and Charter that block or slow some web traffic. California even bans promotions for free streaming apps, a practice that can stifle the businesses of other websites that do not have the resources to offer such promotions. \\r\\n<br>But court battles have complicated the enforcement of the laws. California\u2019s attorney general said the state would not enforce its rules until the federal appeals court ruled on the challenge to the commission\u2019s 2017 repeal.\\r\\n<br>The state laws are being challenged in lawsuits filed by the Justice Department and USTelecom, the telecommunications industry\u2019s main trade group.\\r\\n<p>In repealing the net neutrality rules, the commission included a provision barring states from creating their own regulations. The goal was to avoid a patchwork of rules across the country. Traditionally, states had authority over telecommunications within their borders, but companies and the federal government have argued that the internet\u2019s global nature makes it harder to regulate state by state. \\r\\n<h2>In Congress\\r\\n<br>Members of Congress are expected to introduce net neutrality laws this year that would create nationwide rules, overriding whatever states have adopted. Democrats are pushing the issue, and some Republicans have voiced support for minimal rules.\\r\\n<br>Any legislation is unlikely to pass this year, with Republicans still controlling the Senate. But net neutrality will certainly continue to be a political talking point. It became a campaign issue in the 2018 midterms for Democrats, and the party sees it as a winning issue, particularly among young voters, heading toward the 2020 presidential election.\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"technology.13.txt\",\"id\":-582939649},{\"title\":\"Ask Well: Are \u2018Natural Flavors\u2019 Really Natural?\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"Food manufacturers add flavorings to a surprising number of basic products, like Breyers Natural Vanilla ice cream.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>Q. I heard that \u201cnatural flavors\u201d added to flavored seltzer water are not natural, because of a loophole in the regulations covering additives. Is that true?\\r\\n<br>A. Government regulations define natural flavors as those that derive their aroma or flavor chemicals from plant or animal sources, including fruit, meat, fish, spices, herbs, roots, leaves, buds or bark that are distilled, fermented or otherwise manipulated in a lab. This distinguishes them from artificial flavors, which use man-made chemicals to give a product its particular flavor or aroma. \\r\\n<br>The loophole, as it were, is that for nonorganic foods, the regulations do not restrict the dozens of other ingredients like preservatives and solvents that can go into a so-called natural flavor. Ultimately, because of the wide variety of ingredients that typically go into \u201cnatural\u201d flavorings, \u201cthere does not seem to be much of a difference between natural and artificial flavors,\u201d said David Andrews, a scientist at the Environmental Working Group, a research and advocacy organization.\\r\\n<br>While food processors must list all of the ingredients on a food label, flavor manufacturers do not have to disclose their ingredients. They can add synthetic solvents, preservatives, emulsifiers, carriers and other additives to a flavor that qualifies as natural under current regulations. Natural flavors allowed for use in certified organic foods are subject to a different, far more restrictive set of regulations. They cannot contain a long list of ingredients, including synthetic solvents, carriers and emulsifiers or artificial preservatives, said Gwendolyn Wyard, the Organic Trade Association\u2019s vice president of regulatory and technical affairs. They must use non-petroleum-based solvents, cannot be irradiated and cannot use flavor extracts derived from genetically engineered crops.\\r\\n<p>Flavors labeled \u201corganic flavors\u201d or \u201corganic natural flavors\u201d are even more strictly regulated, consisting almost entirely of organic ingredients; the latter may contain a small amount of natural flavor as well.\\r\\n<br>Some food safety advocates recommend people with food allergies or dietary restrictions avoid food flavorings because the ingredients are not disclosed, but that is a difficult task. Food manufacturers add them to a surprising number of basic items, not just highly processed foods like candy, granola bars and frozen dinners but also to some cold cereals, flavored yogurts, canned soups and spaghetti sauces and even to some apple sauces and ice creams (including Breyers Natural Vanilla).\\r\\n<br>Do you have a health question?

One legislator from the governing Likud party compared the Shin Bet to the K.G.B. Four of the youths were ultimately released.\\r\\n<br>Mr. Netanyahu did rebuff the attacks on the Shin Bet, praising its successes in thwarting Palestinian terrorism.\\r\\n<br>For over a decade, radical young settlers known as the hilltop youth have practiced the doctrine known as \u201cPrice Tag,\u201d which calls for exacting a price through violence or vandalism in revenge for Palestinian attacks on Jews or for army or police moves against rogue settlement activity.\\r\\n<br>A week before the stoning attack, a Palestinian gunman fatally shot two Israeli workers in an Israeli-run factory in the West Bank. In December, two Palestinian attacks on a West Bank road killed two Israeli soldiers and critically wounded a third soldier and a pregnant woman. Her baby was delivered early and died three days later.\\r\\n<p>Violence is endemic around settlements deep in the West Bank, and Jewish attacks often follow Palestinian ones, said Shlomo Fischer, an expert in radical religious Zionism at the Jewish People Policy Institute in Jerusalem. \u201cThe right is tending to view this in terms of a vendetta,\u201d he said.\\r\\n<br>Security officials partly attribute the surge in settler violence to the recent lifting of restrictions from some main activists.\\r\\n<br>The authorities had imposed antiterrorism measures after the 2015 Duma attack and the subsequent exposure of a shadowy militant network known as \u201cthe Revolt.\u201d The group seeks the collapse of the state of Israel and its replacement with a Jewish kingdom based on religious law.\\r\\n<p>The extraordinary steps included administrative detentions and orders keeping key radicals out of the West Bank. Those temporary orders have now run out.\\r\\n<br>The Shin Bet pointed to links between the yeshiva, or religious school, attended by the suspect in the stoning case and the kind of anti-Zionist, messianic ideology behind the Revolt. An Israeli flag scrawled with \u201cdeath to the Zionists\u201d and a swastika was found in a yeshiva dorm.\\r\\n<br>Some of the rabbis teaching at the yeshiva, Pri Haaretz, are associated with the extremist margins of the settlement movement. One of the yeshiva\u2019s founding directors, a senior officer in Israel\u2019s military reserves, was suspected of killing a Palestinian man in disputed circumstances in late 2017.\\r\\n<br>The links became apparent the morning after the killing of Ms. al-Rabi, when a car set out from the settlement of Yitzhar to coach the students in how to deal with Shin Bet interrogations. The occupants included Meir Ettinger, the alleged leader of the Revolt and a grandson of Meir Kahane, the slain American-Israeli rabbi considered the father of far-right Jewish militancy, and Akiva HaCohen, considered one of the architects of the Price Tag policy.\\r\\n<p>Pri Haaretz sits in a scruffy compound at the entrance of the settlement of Rehelim, a small community with neat rows of houses and a boutique winery.\\r\\n<br>On a recent weekday, chickens scratched around in the dirt outside a dozen or so trailers housing classrooms and living quarters. Pupils sported the flowing side-locks associated with the hilltop youth. Two severed goats\u2019 heads were impaled on a chain-link fence, gruesome trophies from an apparent practice session in ritual slaughter.\\r\\n<br>Some residents of Rehelim now want to expel Pri Haaretz from the settlement. One said the school\u2019s ideology was too extreme and was bound to cause trouble. Yeshiva leaders refused to comment.\\r\\n<p>The suspect whose DNA was found on the rock denied any involvement, according to his lawyers. He has not been publicly identified because he is a minor. One rabbi provided law enforcement with an apparent alibi, declaring that he had been eating and singing with the pupils at the yeshiva, including, to the best of his memory, the one who was later charged, till midnight.\\r\\n<br>Recounting the events of that night in an interview, Ms. al-Rabi\u2019s widower, Yacoub, described how the stone smashed through the front windshield, striking his wife in the head and causing her brains and blood to spill out \u201clike a waterfall.\u201d She died on the spot.\\r\\n<br>Mr. al-Rabi said it was incomprehensible that only one person had been charged in her death since many heavy stones were thrown at the car and it was \u201cimpossible that only one person was throwing them all.\u201d\\r\\n<br>The Israeli military and police are now investigating the death of Mr. Naasan.\\r\\n<br>The settlers say the clash started with an attack on a Jewish teenager who was staying in the settler outpost of Adei Ad over the Sabbath.

To the naked eye, they are not much to look at \u2014 a few teeth, bits of bone. \\r\\n<br>But the fossils contain DNA dating back tens of thousands of years. That genetic material shows that Denisovans were a distinct branch of human evolution, a lost lineage.\\r\\n<br>At some point in the distant past, the Denisovans disappeared \u2014 but not before interbreeding with modern humans. Today, people in places like East Asia and New Guinea still carry fragments of Denisovan DNA.\\r\\n<br>One of the biggest obstacles to understanding the Denisovans is their age. Standard methods for dating these fossils have left scientists perplexed.\\r\\n<p>\u201cEveryone said, \u2018These Denisovans, we have no idea how old they are,\u2019\u201d said Katerina Douka, an archaeologist at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Germany. \\r\\n<br>Over the past six years, Dr. Douka and other experts have been creating a sort of history of the Denisova Cave. They have dated 103 layers of sediment on the cave floor, as well as 50 items found in them, including bones, pieces of charcoal and tools.\\r\\n<br>The scientists unveiled this chronology in a pair of papers published on Wednesday. That timeline shows that humans occupied the cave for perhaps as long as 300,000 years. And it raises some intriguing hints that Denisovans may have been capable of sophisticated thought, on par with modern humans.\\r\\n<br>In an accompanying commentary, Robin Dennell of the University of Exeter in England wrote that Dr. Douka and her colleagues have created \u201ca rigorous and compelling timeline.\u201d\\r\\n<p>Denisova Cave sits about 30 yards above the Anuy River. The cave has a large main chamber with a high ceiling; from there, passageways lead to smaller chambers. Over the past few hundred thousand years, sediment has slowly built up on the cave floor.\\r\\n<p>In the 1970s, Russian scientists began digging into that sediment, finding fossils of animals like hyenas and bears, fragments of humanlike bones and thousands of stone tools, as well as bracelets, beads and other ornaments.\\r\\n<br>In 2010, researchers at the Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Anthropology announced they had found DNA in teeth and bones from the cave. In addition to Denisovan DNA, they found a few bone fragments that contained Neanderthal DNA.\\r\\n<br>By comparing the mutations in this DNA, the scientists got a better sense of how Denisovans and Neanderthals fit into the human family tree. \\r\\n<br>As it turned out, modern humans share a common ancestor with Denisovans and Neanderthals that lived roughly 600,000 years ago. Later \u2014 approximately 400,000 years ago \u2014 the Neanderthal and Denisovan lineages split.\\r\\n<br>Ever since the digging began, Russian researchers have carefully mapped the sedimentary layers in which they found bones and tools. They tried to estimate the ages of the layers, but \u201cthe dates were all over the place,\u201d said Dr. Douka.\\r\\n<br>She and her colleagues at the University of Oxford are experts on determining the age of carbon. Researchers from the University of Wollongong in Australia tried an alternate method called optical dating.\\r\\n<br>The researchers combined results from the two methods to assemble a single chronology of the cave. The findings are largely in agreement: \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a unified story,\u201d said Zenobia Jacobs, an archaeologist at the University of Wollongong.\\r\\n<p>The earliest signs of human life in the cave \u2014 simple stone tools \u2014 are more than 287,000 years old. The tools alone cannot tell us if those first people were Denisovans or Neanderthals. \\r\\n<br>But they are not the style known to be made by Neanderthals, suggesting Denisovans may have been the creators.\\r\\n<br>It\u2019s not until about 200,000 years ago that the oldest Denisovan DNA comes to light. The researchers estimated it to be between 217,000 and 185,000 years old. A Neanderthal DNA sample comes from a layer that formed between 205,000 and 172,000 years ago.\\r\\n<br>In the millenniums that followed, both Denisovans and Neanderthals left more genetic evidence in the cave. It may have been continually occupied for thousands of years by one group, then abandoned and reoccupied by others.\\r\\n<br>But Neanderthals and Denisovans must have overlapped at least once during those tens of thousands of years. \\r\\n<p>In August, researchers reported a bone fragment from a girl whose mother was a Neanderthal and father was a Denisovan. In the new study, researchers estimate that this hybrid child lived between 79,100 and 118,100 years ago.\\r\\n<br>The researchers found no Neanderthal remains in more recent layers of the cave floor \u2014 only Denisovan. A Denisovan tooth dates back to between 55,300 and 84,100 years ago; a Denisovan chip of bone is 51,600 to 76,200 years old.\\r\\n<p>[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\\r\\n<br>Paradoxically, the most recent parts of the cave have yielded some of its biggest mysteries. \\r\\n<br>Starting around 45,000 years ago, new kinds of artifacts begin showing up in the cave floor. They include pointed pieces of bone, as well as ornaments like stone bracelets and beads. One possibility is that these new tools were made by newly arrived modern humans. \\r\\n<br>Modern humans evolved in Africa and then expanded out to other continents. They may have made it to what is now Siberia: One human fossil discovered there dates to about 45,000 years ago.\\r\\n<br>But Michael Shunkov, a co-author of the new studies and the director of Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography at the Russian Academy of Sciences, disagrees with that interpretation. \\r\\n<br>The sophisticated tools in the Denisova Cave show \u201cno clear indications for outside influences,\u201d he said in an email. Instead, Dr. Shunkov believes that the Denisovans who occupied the cave for perhaps 250,000 years developed this technology on their own.\\r\\n<br>One way to resolve this question would be to find human fossils from that period. \\r\\n<br>Dr. Douka and her colleagues have discovered a bone dating back between 45,900 and 50,000 years ago that contains humanlike proteins \u2014 but no DNA. It could belong to a modern human, a Neanderthal or a Denisovan.\\r\\n<br>Researchers are scouring the cave floor for still more fossils. A fossil from around 45,000 years ago could be loaded with surprises. \\r\\n<p>What if the ornaments from that period were made by hybrids of modern humans and Denisovans? \\r\\n<br>\u201cThis dichotomy, that it has to be one or the other, is a little bit old-fashioned,\u201d Dr. Douka said.\\r\\n<p>\",\"evals\":[],\"filename\":\"science.4.txt\",\"id\":-1309279343},{\"title\":\"Amazon Jitters Offset Upbeat Jobs Data on Wall Street\\r\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"Wall Street ended mixed on Friday, as optimism from a surge in January U.S. job growth was offset by a weaker-than-expected outlook from Amazon.com Inc that battered retail stocks.\\r\",\"content\":\"<p>(Reuters) - Wall Street ended mixed on Friday, as optimism from a surge in January U.S. job growth was offset by a weaker-than-expected outlook from Amazon.com Inc that battered retail stocks.\\r\\n<br>The online retail heavyweight slumped 5.38 percent after its quarterly sales forecast fell short of Wall Street estimates, overshadowing its record sales and profit during the holiday season.\\r\\n<br>Those results put the Nasdaq in negative territory, while retailers Walmart Inc, Macy's Inc and Kohl's Corp each dropped more than 2 percent.

It does not mean it is a company, a corporation, partnership, or have any such formal organization, but it can range from a street peddler to General Motors.\\\"[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving a business name does not separate the business entity from the owner, which means that the owner of the business is responsible and liable for all debts incurred by the business. If the business acquires debts, the creditors can go after the owner's personal possessions. A business structure does not allow for corporate tax rates. The proprietor is personally taxed on all income from the business.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term is also often used colloquially (but not by lawyers or by public officials) to refer to a company. A company, on the other hand, is a separate legal entity and provides for limited liability, as well as corporate tax rates. A company structure is more complicated and expensive to set up, but offers more protection and benefits for the owner.\\r\\n\\r\\nForms\\r\\nMain article: List of business entities\\r\\nForms of business ownership vary by jurisdiction, but several common entities exist:\\r\\n\\r\\nSole proprietorship: A sole proprietorship, also known as a sole trader, is owned by one person and operates for their benefit. The owner operates the business alone and may hire employees. A sole proprietor has unlimited liability for all obligations incurred by the business, whether from operating costs or judgments against the business. All assets of the business belong to a sole proprietor, including, for example, computer infrastructure, any inventory, manufacturing equipment, or retail fixtures, as well as any real property owned by the sole proprietor.\\r\\nPartnership: A partnership is a business owned by two or more people. In most forms of partnerships, each partner has unlimited liability for the debts incurred by the business. The three most prevalent types of for-profit partnerships are: general partnerships, limited partnerships, and limited liability partnerships.[6]\\r\\nCorporation: The owners of a corporation have limited liability and the business has a separate legal personality from its owners. Corporations can be either government-owned or privately owned. They can organize either for profit or as nonprofit organizations. A privately owned, for-profit corporation is owned by its shareholders, who elect a board of directors to direct the corporation and hire its managerial staff. A privately owned, for-profit corporation can be either privately held by a small group of individuals, or publicly held, with publicly traded shares listed on a stock exchange.\\r\\nCooperative: Often referred to as a \\\"co-op\\\", a cooperative is a limited-liability business that can organize as for-profit or not-for-profit. A cooperative differs from a corporation in that it has members, not shareholders, and they share decision-making authority. Cooperatives are typically classified as either consumer cooperatives or worker cooperatives. Cooperatives are fundamental to the ideology of economic democracy.\\r\\nLimited liability companies (LLC), limited liability partnerships, and other specific types of business organization protect their owners or shareholders from business failure by doing business under a separate legal entity with certain legal protections. In contrast, unincorporated businesses or persons working on their own are usually not as protected.[7][8]\\r\\nFranchises: A franchise is a system in which entrepreneurs purchase the rights to open and run a business from a larger corporation.[9] Franchising in the United States is widespread and is a major economic powerhouse. One out of twelve retail businesses in the United States are franchised and 8 million people are employed in a franchised business.[10]\\r\\nA company limited by guarantee: Commonly used where companies are formed for noncommercial purposes, such as clubs or charities. The members guarantee the payment of certain (usually nominal) amounts if the company goes into insolvent liquidation, but otherwise, they have no economic rights in relation to the company. This type of company is common in England. A company limited by guarantee may be with or without having share capital.\\r\\nA company limited by shares: The most common form of the company used for business ventures. Specifically, a limited company is a \\\"company in which the liability of each shareholder is limited to the amount individually invested\\\" with corporations being \\\"the most common example of a limited company.\\\"[11] This type of company is common in England and many English-speaking countries. A company limited by shares may be a\\r\\npublicly traded company or a\\r\\nprivately held company\\r\\nA company limited by guarantee with a share capital: A hybrid entity, usually used where the company is formed for noncommercial purposes, but the activities of the company are partly funded by investors who expect a return. This type of company may no longer be formed in the UK, although provisions still exist in law for them to exist.[12]\\r\\nA limited liability company: \\\"A company\ufffdstatutorily authorized in certain states\ufffdthat is characterized by limited liability, management by members or managers, and limitations on ownership transfer\\\", i.e., L.L.C.[11] LLC structure has been called \\\"hybrid\\\" in that it \\\"combines the characteristics of a corporation and of a partnership or sole proprietorship\\\". Like a corporation, it has limited liability for members of the company, and like a partnership it has \\\"flow-through taxation to the members\\\" and must be \\\"dissolved upon the death or bankruptcy of a member\\\".[13]\\r\\nAn unlimited company with or without a share capital: A hybrid entity, a company where the liability of members or shareholders for the debts (if any) of the company are not limited. In this case doctrine of a veil of incorporation does not apply.\\r\\nLess common types of companies are:\\r\\n\\r\\nCompanies formed by letters patent: Most corporations by letters patent are corporations sole and not companies as the term is commonly understood today.\\r\\nCharter corporations: Before the passing of modern companies legislation, these were the only types of companies. Now they are relatively rare, except for very old companies that still survive (of which there are still many, particularly many British banks), or modern societies that fulfill a quasi-regulatory function (for example, the Bank of England is a corporation formed by a modern charter).\\r\\nStatutory companies: Relatively rare today, certain companies have been formed by a private statute passed in the relevant jurisdiction.\\r\\nNote that \\\"Ltd after the company's name signifies limited company, and PLC (public limited company) indicates that its shares are widely held.\\\"[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn legal parlance, the owners of a company are normally referred to as the \\\"members\\\". In a company limited or unlimited by shares (formed or incorporated with a share capital), this will be the shareholders. In a company limited by guarantee, this will be the guarantors. Some offshore jurisdictions have created special forms of offshore company in a bid to attract business for their jurisdictions. Examples include \\\"segregated portfolio companies\\\" and restricted purpose companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are, however, many, many sub-categories of types of company that can be formed in various jurisdictions in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompanies are also sometimes distinguished for legal and regulatory purposes between public companies and private companies. Public companies are companies whose shares can be publicly traded, often (although not always) on a stock exchange which imposes listing requirements\/Listing Rules as to the issued shares, the trading of shares and future issue of shares to help bolster the reputation of the exchange or particular market of an exchange. Private companies do not have publicly traded shares, and often contain restrictions on transfers of shares. In some jurisdictions, private companies have maximum numbers of shareholders.\\r\\n\\r\\nA parent company is a company that owns enough voting stock in another firm to control management and operations by influencing or electing its board of directors; the second company being deemed as a subsidiary of the parent company. The definition of a parent company differs by jurisdiction, with the definition normally being defined by way of laws dealing with companies in that jurisdiction.\\r\\n\\r\\nClassifications\\r\\nMain article: Industry classification\\r\\nAgriculture, such as the domestication of fish, animals and livestock, as well as lumber, oil and mining businesses that extract natural resources and raw materials, such as wood, petroleum, natural gas, ores, plants or minerals.\\r\\nFinancial services businesses include banks, brokerage firms, credit unions, credit cards, insurance companies, asset and investment companies such as private equity firms, private equity funds, real estate investment trusts, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, mutual funds, index funds, and hedge funds, stock exchanges, and other companies that generate profits through investment and management of capital.\\r\\nEntertainment companies and mass media agencies generate profits primarily from the sale of intellectual property. They include film studios and production houses, mass media companies such as cable television networks, online digital media agencies, talent agencies, mobile media outlets, newspapers, book and magazine publishing houses.\\r\\nIndustrial manufacturers produce products, either from raw materials or from component parts, then export the finished products at a profit. They include tangible goods such as cars, buses, medical devices, glass, or aircraft.\\r\\nReal estate businesses sell, invest, construct and develop properties, including land, residential homes, and other buildings.\\r\\nRetailers, wholesalers, and distributors act as middlemen and get goods produced by manufacturers to the intended consumers; they make their profits by marking up their prices. Most stores and catalog companies are distributors or retailers.\\r\\nTransportation businesses such as railways, airlines, shipping companies that deliver goods and individuals to their destinations for a fee.\\r\\nUtilities produce public services such as water, electricity, waste management or sewage treatment. These industries are usually operated under the charge of a public government.\\r\\nService businesses offer intangible goods or services and typically charge for labor or other services provided to government, to consumers, or to other businesses. Interior decorators, beauticians, hairstylists, make-up artists, tanning salons, laundromats, dry cleaners, and pest controllers are service businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nActivities\\r\\nAccounting\\r\\nMain article: Accounting\\r\\nAccounting is the measurement, processing and communication of financial information about economic entities[15][16] such as businesses and corporations. The modern field was established by the Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli in 1494.[17] Accounting, which has been called the \\\"language of business\\\",[18] measures the results of an organization's economic activities and conveys this information to a variety of users, including investors, creditors, management, and regulators.[19] Practitioners of accounting are known as accountants. The terms \\\"accounting\\\" and \\\"financial reporting\\\" are often used as synonyms.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinance\\r\\nMain article: Finance\\r\\nFinance is a field that deals with the study of investments. It includes the dynamics of assets and liabilities over time under conditions of different degrees of uncertainty and risk. Finance can also be defined as the science of money management. Finance aims to price assets based on their risk level and their expected rate of return. Finance can be broken into three different sub-categories: public finance, corporate finance and personal finance.\\r\\n\\r\\nManufacturing\\r\\nMain article: Manufacturing\\r\\nManufacturing is the production of merchandise for use or sale using labour and machines, tools, chemical and biological processing, or formulation. The term may refer to a range of human activity, from handicraft to high tech, but is most commonly applied to industrial production, in which raw materials are transformed into finished goods on a large scale.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarketing\\r\\nMain article: Marketing\\r\\nMarketing is defined by the American Marketing Association as \\\"the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.\\\"[20] The term developed from the original meaning which referred literally to going to a market to buy or sell goods or services. Marketing tactics include advertising as well as determining product pricing.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the rise in technology, marketing is further divided into a class called digital marketing. It is marketing products and services using digital technologies.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch and development\\r\\nMain article: Research and development\\r\\nResearch and development refer to activities in connection with corporate or government innovation. Research and development constitute the first stage of development of a potential new service or product. Research and development are very difficult to manage since the defining feature of the research is that the researchers do not know in advance exactly how to accomplish the desired result.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSafety\\r\\nMain article: Safety\\r\\nSafety is a key business concept that is defined by Merriam-Webster as \ufffdthe condition of being safe from undergoing or causing hurt, injury, or loss\ufffd.[21] Injuries cost businesses billions of dollars annually.[22] Studies have shown how company acceptance and implementation of comprehensive safety and health management systems reduces incidents, insurance costs and workers\ufffd compensation claims.[23] New technologies, like wearable safety devices[24] and available online safety training, continue to be developed to encourage employers to invest in protection beyond the \\\"canary in the coalmine\\\" and reduce the cost to businesses of protecting their employees.\\r\\n\\r\\nSales\\r\\nMain article: Sales\\r\\nSales are activity related to selling or the amount of goods or services sold in a given time period. Sales are often integrated with all lines of business and are key to a companies' success.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganization and regulation\\r\\nSee also: Theory of the firm\\r\\nMost legal jurisdictions specify the forms of ownership that a business can take, creating a body of commercial law for each type.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major factors affecting how a business is organized are usually:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe size and scope of the business firm and its structure, management, and ownership, broadly analyzed in the theory of the firm. Generally, a smaller business is more flexible, while larger businesses, or those with wider ownership or more formal structures, will usually tend to be organized as corporations or (less often) partnerships. In addition, a business that wishes to raise money on a stock market or to be owned by a wide range of people will often be required to adopt a specific legal form to do so.\\r\\nThe sector and country. Private profit-making businesses are different from government-owned bodies. In some countries, certain businesses are legally obliged to be organized in certain ways.\\r\\nTax advantages. Different structures are treated differently in tax law and may have advantages for this reason.\\r\\nDisclosure and compliance requirements. Different business structures may be required to make less or more information public (or report it to relevant authorities) and may be bound to comply with different rules and regulations.\\r\\nMany businesses are operated through a separate entity such as a corporation or a partnership (either formed with or without limited liability). Most legal jurisdictions allow people to organize such an entity by filing certain charter documents with the relevant Secretary of State or equivalent and complying with certain other ongoing obligations. The relationships and legal rights of shareholders, limited partners, or members are governed partly by the charter documents and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the entity is organized. Generally speaking, shareholders in a corporation, limited partners in a limited partnership, and members in a limited liability company are shielded from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the entity, which is legally treated as a separate \\\"person\\\". This means that unless there is misconduct, the owner's own possessions are strongly protected in law if the business does not succeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere two or more individuals own a business together but have failed to organize a more specialized form of vehicle, they will be treated as a general partnership. The terms of a partnership are partly governed by a partnership agreement if one is created, and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. No paperwork or filing is necessary to create a partnership, and without an agreement, the relationships and legal rights of the partners will be entirely governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. A single person who owns and runs a business is commonly known as a sole proprietor, whether that person owns it directly or through a formally organized entity. Depending on the business needs, an adviser can decide what kind is proprietorship will be most suitable.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few relevant factors to consider in deciding how to operate a business include:\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral partners in a partnership (other than a limited liability partnership), plus anyone who personally owns and operates a business without creating a separate legal entity, are personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business.\\r\\nGenerally, corporations are required to pay tax just like \\\"real\\\" people. In some tax systems, this can give rise to so-called double taxation, because first the corporation pays tax on the profit, and then when the corporation distributes its profits to its owners, individuals have to include dividends in their income when they complete their personal tax returns, at which point a second layer of income tax is imposed.\\r\\nIn most countries, there are laws which treat small corporations differently from large ones. They may be exempt from certain legal filing requirements or labor laws, have simplified procedures in specialized areas, and have simplified, advantageous, or slightly different tax treatment.\\r\\n\\\"Going public\\\" through a process known as an initial public offering (IPO) means that part of the business will be owned by members of the public. This requires the organization as a distinct entity, to disclose information to the public, and adhering to a tighter set of laws and procedures. Most public entities are corporations that have sold shares, but increasingly there are also public LLC's that sell units (sometimes also called shares), and other more exotic entities as well, such as, for example, real estate investment trusts in the USA, and unit trusts in the UK. A general partnership cannot \\\"go public\\\".\\r\\nCommercial law\\r\\nMain article: Corporate law\\r\\n\\r\\nOffices in the Los Angeles Downtown Financial District\\r\\nA very detailed and well-established body of rules that evolved over a very long period of time applies to commercial transactions. The need to regulate trade and commerce and resolve business disputes helped shape the creation of law and courts. The Code of Hammurabi dates back to about 1772 BC for example, and contains provisions that relate, among other matters, to shipping costs and dealings between merchants and brokers.[27] The word \\\"corporation\\\" derives from the Latin corpus, meaning body, and the Maurya Empire in Iron-Age India accorded legal rights to business entities.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many countries, it is difficult to compile all the laws that can affect a business into a single reference source. Laws can govern treatment of labour and employee relations, worker protection and safety, discrimination on the basis of age, gender, disability, race, and in some jurisdictions, sexual orientation, and the minimum wage, as well as unions, worker compensation, and working hours and leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome specialized businesses may also require licenses, either due to laws governing entry into certain trades, occupations or professions, that require special education or to raise revenue for local governments. Professions that require special licenses include law, medicine, piloting aircraft, selling liquor, radio broadcasting, selling investment securities, selling used cars, and roofing. Local jurisdictions may also require special licenses and taxes just to operate a business.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome businesses are subject to ongoing special regulation, for example, public utilities, investment securities, banking, insurance, broadcasting, aviation, and health care providers. Environmental regulations are also very complex and can affect many businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nCapital\\r\\n\\r\\nMexican Stock Exchange in Paseo de la Reforma, Mexico City\\r\\nWhen businesses need to raise money (called capital), they sometimes offer securities for sale.\\r\\n\\r\\nCapital may be raised through private means, by an initial public offering or IPO on a stock exchange, or in other ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor stock exchanges include the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Singapore Exchange, Hong Kong Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ (the USA), the London Stock Exchange (UK), the Tokyo Stock Exchange (Japan), and Bombay Stock Exchange (India). Most countries with capital markets have at least one.\\r\\n\\r\\nBusinesses that have gone public are subject to regulations concerning their internal governance, such as how executive officers' compensation is determined, and when and how information is disclosed to shareholders and to the public. In the United States, these regulations are primarily implemented and enforced by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Other western nations have comparable regulatory bodies. The regulations are implemented and enforced by the China Securities Regulation Commission (CSRC) in China. In Singapore, the regulatory authority is the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and in Hong Kong, it is the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proliferation and increasing complexity of the laws governing business have forced increasing specialization in corporate law. It is not unheard of for certain kinds of corporate transactions to require a team of five to ten attorneys due to sprawling regulation. Commercial law spans general corporate law, employment and labor law, health-care law, securities law, mergers and acquisitions, tax law, employee benefit plans, food and drug regulation, intellectual property law on copyrights, patents, trademarks, telecommunications law, and financing.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther types of capital sourcing include crowdsourcing on the Internet, venture capital, bank loans, and debentures.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntellectual property\\r\\nMain article: Intellectual property\\r\\nBusinesses often have important \\\"intellectual property\\\" that needs protection from competitors for the company to stay profitable. This could require patents, copyrights, trademarks, or preservation of trade secrets. Most businesses have names, logos, and similar branding techniques that could benefit from trademarking. Patents and copyrights in the United States are largely governed by federal law, while trade secrets and trademarking are mostly a matter of state law. Because of the nature of intellectual property, a business needs protection in every jurisdiction in which they are concerned about competitors. Many countries are signatories to international treaties concerning intellectual property, and thus companies registered in these countries are subject to national laws bound by these treaties. In order to protect trade secrets, companies may require employees to sign noncompete clauses which will impose limitations on an employee's interactions with stakeholders, and competitors.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrade union\\r\\nMain article: Trade union\\r\\nA trade union (or labor union) is an organization of workers who have come together to achieve common goals such as protecting the integrity of its trade, improving safety standards, achieving higher pay and benefits such as health care and retirement, increasing the number of employees an employer assigns to complete the work, and better working conditions. The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members (rank and file members) and negotiates labor contracts (collective bargaining) with employers. The most common purpose of these associations or unions is \\\"maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment\\\".[29] This may include the negotiation of wages, work rules, complaint procedures, rules governing hiring, firing, and promotion of workers, benefits, workplace safety and policies.\",\"evals\":[],\"id\":643957705},{\"title\":\"health\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"See also: Social determinants of health and Risk factor\\rGenerally, the context in which an individual lives is of great importance for both his health status and quality of their life[18].

It is increasingly recognized that health is maintained and improved not only through the advancement and application of health science, but also through the efforts and intelligent lifestyle choices of the individual and society. According to the World Health Organization, the main determinants of health include the social and economic environment, the physical environment and the person's individual characteristics and behaviors.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nMore specifically, key factors that have been found to influence whether people are healthy or unhealthy include the following:[19][20][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIncome and social status\\r\\nSocial support networks\\r\\nEducation and literacy\\r\\nEmployment\/working conditions\\r\\nSocial environments\\r\\nPhysical environments\\r\\nPersonal health practices and coping skills\\r\\nHealthy child development\\r\\nBiology and genetics\\r\\nHealth care services\\r\\nGender\\r\\nCulture\\r\\n\\r\\nDonald Henderson as part of the CDC's smallpox eradication team in 1966.\\r\\nAn increasing number of studies and reports from different organizations and contexts examine the linkages between health and different factors, including lifestyles, environments, health care organization and health policy, one specific health policy brought into many countries in recent years was the introduction of the sugar tax. Beverage taxes came into light with increasing concerns about obesity, particularly among youth. Sugar-sweetened beverages have become a target of anti-obesity initiatives with increasing evidence of their link to obesity.[22]\ufffd such as the 1974 Lalonde report from Canada;[21] the Alameda County Study in California;[23] and the series of World Health Reports of the World Health Organization, which focuses on global health issues including access to health care and improving public health outcomes, especially in developing countries.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe concept of the \\\"health field,\\\" as distinct from medical care, emerged from the Lalonde report from Canada. The report identified three interdependent fields as key determinants of an individual's health. These are:[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nLifestyle: the aggregation of personal decisions (i.e., over which the individual has control) that can be said to contribute to, or cause, illness or death;\\r\\nEnvironmental: all matters related to health external to the human body and over which the individual has little or no control;\\r\\nBiomedical: all aspects of health, physical and mental, developed within the human body as influenced by genetic make-up.\\r\\nThe maintenance and promotion of health is achieved through different combination of physical, mental, and social well-being, together sometimes referred to as the \\\"health triangle.\\\"[25][26] The WHO's 1986 Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion further stated that health is not just a state, but also \\\"a resource for everyday life, not the objective of living. Health is a positive concept emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities.\\\"[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nFocusing more on lifestyle issues and their relationships with functional health, data from the Alameda County Study suggested that people can improve their health via exercise, enough sleep, maintaining a healthy body weight, limiting alcohol use, and avoiding smoking.[28] Health and illness can co-exist, as even people with multiple chronic diseases or terminal illnesses can consider themselves healthy.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe environment is often cited as an important factor influencing the health status of individuals. This includes characteristics of the natural environment, the built environment and the social environment. Factors such as clean water and air, adequate housing, and safe communities and roads all have been found to contribute to good health, especially to the health of infants and children.[19][30] Some studies have shown that a lack of neighborhood recreational spaces including natural environment leads to lower levels of personal satisfaction and higher levels of obesity, linked to lower overall health and well being.[31] This suggests that the positive health benefits of natural space in urban neighborhoods should be taken into account in public policy and land use.\\r\\n\\r\\nGenetics, or inherited traits from parents, also play a role in determining the health status of individuals and populations. This can encompass both the predisposition to certain diseases and health conditions, as well as the habits and behaviors individuals develop through the lifestyle of their families. For example, genetics may play a role in the manner in which people cope with stress, either mental, emotional or physical. For example, obesity is a significant problem in the United States that contributes to bad mental health and causes stress in the lives of great numbers of people[32]. (One difficulty is the issue raised by the debate over the relative strengths of genetics and other factors; interactions between genetics and environment may be of particular importance.)\\r\\n\\r\\nPotential issues\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of types of health issues are common around the globe. Disease is one of the most common. According to GlobalIssues.org, approximately 36 million people die each year from non-communicable (not contagious) disease including cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic lung disease (Shah, 2014).\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong communicable diseases, both viral and bacterial, AIDS\/HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria are the most common, causing millions of deaths every year (Shah, 2014).\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother health issue that causes death or contributes to other health problems is malnutrition, especially among children. One of the groups malnutrition affects most is young children. Approximately 7.5 million children under the age of 5 die from malnutrition, usually brought on by not having the money to find or make food (Shah, 2014).\\r\\n\\r\\nBodily injuries are also a common health issue worldwide. These injuries, including broken bones, fractures, and burns can reduce a person's quality of life or can cause fatalities including infections that resulted from the injury or the severity injury in general (Moffett, 2013).[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nLifestyle choices are contributing factors to poor health in many cases. These include smoking cigarettes, and can also include a poor diet, whether it is overeating or an overly constrictive diet. Inactivity can also contribute to health issues and also a lack of sleep, excessive alcohol consumption, and neglect of oral hygiene (Moffett2013).There are also genetic disorders that are inherited by the person and can vary in how much they affect the person and when they surface (Moffett, 2013).\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the majority of these health issues are preventable, a major contributor to global ill health is the fact that approximately 1 billion people lack access to health care systems (Shah, 2014). Arguably, the most common and harmful health issue is that a great many people do not have access to quality remedies.[34][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nMental health\\r\\nMain article: Mental health\\r\\nThe World Health Organization describes mental health as \\\"a state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community\\\".[36] Mental Health is not just the absence of mental illness.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nMental illness is described as 'the spectrum of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral conditions that interfere with social and emotional well-being and the lives and productivity of people. Having a mental illness can seriously impair, temporarily or permanently, the mental functioning of a person. Other terms include: 'mental health problem', 'illness', 'disorder', 'dysfunction'.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nRoughly a quarter of all adults 18 and over in the US are considered diagnosable with mental illness. Mental illnesses are the leading cause of disability in the US and Canada. Examples include, schizophrenia, ADHD, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and autism.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany teens suffer from mental health issues in response to the pressures of society and social problems they encounter. Some of the key mental health issues seen in teens are: depression, eating disorders, and drug abuse. There are many ways to prevent these health issues from occurring such as communicating well with a teen suffering from mental health issues. Mental health can be treated and be attentive to teens' behavior.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\n Many factors contribute to mental health problems, including:\\r\\n\\r\\nBiological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry\\r\\nLife experiences, such as trauma or abuse\\r\\nFamily history of mental health problems\\r\\nMaintaining\\r\\nAchieving and maintaining health is an ongoing process, shaped by both the evolution of health care knowledge and practices as well as personal strategies and organized interventions for staying healthy.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiet\\r\\nMain articles: Healthy diet and Human nutrition\\r\\n\\r\\nPercentage of overweight or obese population in 2010, Data source: OECD's iLibrary, http:\/\/stats.oecd.org[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nPercentage of obese population in 2010, Data source: OECD's iLibrary, http:\/\/stats.oecd.org[42]\\r\\nAn important way to maintain your personal health is to have a healthy diet. A healthy diet includes a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods that provide nutrients to your body. Such nutrients give you energy and keep your body running. Nutrients help build and strengthen bones, muscles, and tendons and also regulate body processes (i.e. blood pressure). The food guide pyramid is a pyramid-shaped guide of healthy foods divided into sections. Each section shows the recommended intake for each food group (i.e. Protein, Fat, Carbohydrates, and Sugars). Making healthy food choices is important because it can lower your risk of heart disease, developing some types of cancer, and it will contribute to maintaining a healthy weight.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mediterranean diet is commonly associated with health-promoting effects due to the fact that it contains some bioactive compounds like phenolic compounds, isoprenoids and alkaloids.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nExercise\\r\\nMain article: Exercise\\r\\nPhysical exercise enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness. It strengthens muscles and improves the cardiovascular system. According to the National Institutes of Health, there are four types of exercise: endurance, strength, flexibility, and balance.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nSleep\\r\\nMain articles: Sleep and Sleep deprivation\\r\\nSleep is an essential component to maintaining health. In children, sleep is also vital for growth and development. Ongoing sleep deprivation has been linked to an increased risk for some chronic health problems. In addition, sleep deprivation has been shown to correlate with both increased susceptibility to illness and slower recovery times from illness.[46] In one study, people with chronic insufficient sleep, set as six hours of sleep a night or less, were found to be four times more likely to catch a cold compared to those who reported sleeping for seven hours or more a night.[47] Due to the role of sleep in regulating metabolism, insufficient sleep may also play a role in weight gain or, conversely, in impeding weight loss.[48] Additionally, in 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is the cancer research agency for the World Health Organization, declared that \\\"shiftwork that involves circadian disruption is probably carcinogenic to humans,\\\" speaking to the dangers of long-term nighttime work due to its intrusion on sleep.[49] In 2015, the National Sleep Foundation released updated recommendations for sleep duration requirements based on age and concluded that \\\"Individuals who habitually sleep outside the normal range may be exhibiting signs or symptoms of serious health problems or, if done volitionally, may be compromising their health and well-being.\\\"[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nRole of science\\r\\nMain articles: Health science and Health care\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dutch Public Health Service provides medical care for the natives of the Dutch East Indies, May 1946\\r\\nHealth science is the branch of science focused on health. There are two main approaches to health science: the study and research of the body and health-related issues to understand how humans (and animals) function, and the application of that knowledge to improve health and to prevent and cure diseases and other physical and mental impairments. The science builds on many sub-fields, including biology, biochemistry, physics, epidemiology, pharmacology, medical sociology. Applied health sciences endeavor to better understand and improve human health through applications in areas such as health education, biomedical engineering, biotechnology and public health.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganized interventions to improve health based on the principles and procedures developed through the health sciences are provided by practitioners trained in medicine, nursing, nutrition, pharmacy, social work, psychology, occupational therapy, physical therapy and other health care professions. Clinical practitioners focus mainly on the health of individuals, while public health practitioners consider the overall health of communities and populations. Workplace wellness programs are increasingly adopted by companies for their value in improving the health and well-being of their employees, as are school health services in order to improve the health and well-being of children.\\r\\n\\r\\nRole of public health\\r\\nMain article: Public health\\r\\nSee also: Global health\\r\\n\\r\\nPostage stamp, New Zealand, 1933. Public health has been promoted \ufffd and depicted \ufffd in a wide variety of ways.\\r\\nPublic health has been described as \\\"the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations, public and private, communities and individuals.\\\"[51] It is concerned with threats to the overall health of a community based on population health analysis. The population in question can be as small as a handful of people or as large as all the inhabitants of several continents (for instance, in the case of a pandemic). Public health has many sub-fields, but typically includes the interdisciplinary categories of epidemiology, biostatistics and health services. Environmental health, community health, behavioral health, and occupational health are also important areas of public health.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe focus of public health interventions is to prevent and manage diseases, injuries and other health conditions through surveillance of cases and the promotion of healthy behavior, communities, and (in aspects relevant to human health) environments. Its aim is to prevent health problems from happening or re-occurring by implementing educational programs, developing policies, administering services and conducting research.[52] In many cases, treating a disease or controlling a pathogen can be vital to preventing it in others, such as during an outbreak. Vaccination programs and distribution of condoms to prevent the spread of communicable diseases are examples of common preventive public health measures, as are educational campaigns to promote vaccination and the use of condoms (including overcoming resistance to such).\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic health also takes various actions to limit the health disparities between different areas of the country and, in some cases, the continent or world. One issue is the access of individuals and communities to health care in terms of financial, geographical or socio-cultural constraints to accessing and using services.[53] Applications of the public health system include the areas of maternal and child health, health services administration, emergency response, and prevention and control of infectious and chronic diseases.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great positive impact of public health programs is widely acknowledged. Due in part to the policies and actions developed through public health, the 20th century registered a decrease in the mortality rates for infants and children and a continual increase in life expectancy in most parts of the world. For example, it is estimated that life expectancy has increased for Americans by thirty years since 1900,[54] and worldwide by six years since 1990.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nSelf-care strategies\\r\\nMain article: Self care\\r\\nSee also: Chronic care management, Social relation, and Stress management\\r\\n\\r\\nA lady washing her hands c. 1655\\r\\nPersonal health depends partially on the active, passive, and assisted cues people observe and adopt about their own health. These include personal actions for preventing or minimizing the effects of a disease, usually a chronic condition, through integrative care. They also include personal hygiene practices to prevent infection and illness, such as bathing and washing hands with soap; brushing and flossing teeth; storing, preparing and handling food safely; and many others. The information gleaned from personal observations of daily living \ufffd such as about sleep patterns, exercise behavior, nutritional intake and environmental features \ufffd may be used to inform personal decisions and actions (e.g., \\\"I feel tired in the morning so I am going to try sleeping on a different pillow\\\"), as well as clinical decisions and treatment plans (e.g., a patient who notices his or her shoes are tighter than usual may be having exacerbation of left-sided heart failure, and may require diuretic medication to reduce fluid overload).[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonal health also depends partially on the social structure of a person's life. The maintenance of strong social relationships, volunteering, and other social activities have been linked to positive mental health and also increased longevity. One American study among seniors over age 70, found that frequent volunteering was associated with reduced risk of dying compared with older persons who did not volunteer, regardless of physical health status.[57] Another study from Singapore reported that volunteering retirees had significantly better cognitive performance scores, fewer depressive symptoms, and better mental well-being and life satisfaction than non-volunteering retirees.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nProlonged psychological stress may negatively impact health, and has been cited as a factor in cognitive impairment with aging, depressive illness, and expression of disease.[59] Stress management is the application of methods to either reduce stress or increase tolerance to stress. Relaxation techniques are physical methods used to relieve stress. Psychological methods include cognitive therapy, meditation, and positive thinking, which work by reducing response to stress. Improving relevant skills, such as problem solving and time management skills, reduces uncertainty and builds confidence, which also reduces the reaction to stress-causing situations where those skills are applicable.\\r\\n\\r\\nOccupational\\r\\nMain article: Occupational safety and health\\r\\nIn addition to safety risks, many jobs also present risks of disease, illness and other long-term health problems. Among the most common occupational diseases are various forms of pneumoconiosis, including silicosis and coal worker's pneumoconiosis (black lung disease). Asthma is another respiratory illness that many workers are vulnerable to. Workers may also be vulnerable to skin diseases, including eczema, dermatitis, urticaria, sunburn, and skin cancer.[60][61] Other occupational diseases of concern include carpal tunnel syndrome and lead poisoning.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the number of service sector jobs has risen in developed countries, more and more jobs have become sedentary, presenting a different array of health problems than those associated with manufacturing and the primary sector. Contemporary problems, such as the growing rate of obesity and issues relating to stress and overwork in many countries, have further complicated the interaction between work and health.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany governments view occupational health as a social challenge and have formed public organizations to ensure the health and safety of workers. Examples of these include the British Health and Safety Executive and in the United States, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which conducts research on occupational health and safety, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which handles regulation and policy relating to worker safety and health.[62][63][64]\",\"evals\":[],\"id\":-1897987410},{\"title\":\"science\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"The earliest roots of science can be traced to Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3500 to 3000 BCE.[3][4] Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal ...\",\"content\":\"Science (from Latin scientia, meaning \\\"knowledge\\\")[1] is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.[2][a]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest roots of science can be traced to Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3500 to 3000 BCE.[3][4] Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to explain events of the physical world based on natural causes.[3][4] After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, knowledge of Greek conceptions of the world deteriorated in Western Europe during the early centuries (400 to 1000 CE) of the Middle Ages[5] but was preserved in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age.[6] The recovery and assimilation of Greek works and Islamic inquiries into Western Europe from the 10th to 13th century revived natural philosophy,[5][7] which was later transformed by the Scientific Revolution that began in the 16th century[8] as new ideas and discoveries departed from previous Greek conceptions and traditions.[9][10][11][12] The scientific method soon played a greater role in knowledge creation and it was not until the 19th century that many of the institutional and professional features of science began to take shape.[13][14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nModern science is typically divided into three major branches that consist of the natural sciences (e.g., biology, chemistry, and physics), which study nature in the broadest sense; the social sciences (e.g., economics, psychology, and sociology), which study individuals and societies; and the formal sciences (e.g., logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science), which study abstract concepts. There is disagreement,[16][17] however, on whether the formal sciences actually constitute a science as they do not rely on empirical evidence.[18] Disciplines that utilize existing scientific knowledge for practical purposes, such as engineering and medicine, are described as applied sciences.[19][20][21][22]\\r\\n\\r\\nScience is based on research, which is commonly conducted in academic and research institutions as well as in government agencies and companies. The practical impact of scientific research has led to the emergence of science policies that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by prioritizing the development of commercial products, armaments, health care, and environmental protection.\\r\\n\\r\\nBranches of science\\r\\nMain article: Branches of science\\r\\nModern science is commonly divided into three major branches that consist of the natural sciences, social sciences, and formal sciences. Each of these branches comprise various specialized yet overlapping scientific disciplines that often possess their own nomenclature and expertise.[88] Both natural and social sciences are empirical sciences[89] as their knowledge are based on empirical observations and are capable of being tested for its validity by other researchers working under the same conditions.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also closely related disciplines that use science, such as engineering and medicine.\\r\\n\\r\\nNatural science\\r\\nMain articles: Natural science and Outline of natural science\\r\\n\\r\\nFalse-color composite of global oceanic and terrestrial photoautotroph abundance by the SeaWiFS Project, NASA\/Goddard Space Flight Center, and ORBIMAGE.\\r\\nNatural science is concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of natural phenomena based on empirical evidence from observation and experimentation. It can be divided into two main branches: life science (or biological science) and physical science. Physical science is subdivided into branches, including physics, chemistry, astronomy and earth science. These two branches may be further divided into more specialized disciplines. Modern natural science is the successor to the natural philosophy that began in Ancient Greece. Galileo, Descartes, Bacon, and Newton debated the benefits of using approaches which were more mathematical and more experimental in a methodical way. Still, philosophical perspectives, conjectures, and presuppositions, often overlooked, remain necessary in natural science.[91] Systematic data collection, including discovery science, succeeded natural history, which emerged in the 16th century by describing and classifying plants, animals, minerals, and so on.[92] Today, \\\"natural history\\\" suggests observational descriptions aimed at popular audiences.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nSocial science\\r\\nMain articles: Social science and Outline of social science\\r\\n\\r\\nIn economics, the supply and demand model describes how prices vary as a result of a balance between product availability and demand.\\r\\nSocial science is concerned with society and the relationships among individuals within a society. It has many branches that include, but are not limited to, anthropology, archaeology, communication studies, economics, history, human geography, jurisprudence, linguistics, political science, psychology, public health, and sociology. Social scientists may adopt various philosophical theories to study individuals and society. For example, positivist social scientists use methods resembling those of the natural sciences as tools for understanding society, and so define science in its stricter modern sense. Interpretivist social scientists, by contrast, may use social critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing empirically falsifiable theories, and thus treat science in its broader sense. In modern academic practice, researchers are often eclectic, using multiple methodologies (for instance, by combining both quantitative and qualitative research). The term \\\"social research\\\" has also acquired a degree of autonomy as practitioners from various disciplines share in its aims and methods.\\r\\n\\r\\nFormal science\\r\\nMain articles: Formal science and Outline of formal science\\r\\n\\r\\nA humanoid robotic hand (see Shadow Hand system).\\r\\nFormal science is involved in the study of formal systems. It includes mathematics,[94][95] systems theory, robotics, and theoretical computer science. The formal sciences share similarities with the other two branches by relying on objective, careful, and systematic study of an area of knowledge. They are, however, different from the empirical sciences as they rely exclusively on deductive reasoning, without the need for empirical evidence, to verify their abstract concepts.[18][96][97] The formal sciences are therefore a priori disciplines and because of this, there is disagreement on whether they actually constitute a science.[16][17] Nevertheless, the formal sciences play an important role in the empirical sciences. Calculus, for example, was initially invented to understand motion in physics.[98] Natural and social sciences that rely heavily on mathematical applications include mathematical physics, mathematical chemistry, mathematical biology, mathematical finance, and mathematical economics.\\r\\n\\r\\nScientific research\\r\\nSee also: Research\\r\\nScientific research can be labeled as either basic or applied research. Basic research is the search for knowledge and applied research is the search for solutions to practical problems using this knowledge. Although some scientific research is applied research into specific problems, a great deal of our understanding comes from the curiosity-driven undertaking of basic research. This leads to options for technological advance that were not planned or sometimes even imaginable. This point was made by Michael Faraday when allegedly in response to the question \\\"what is the use of basic research?\\\" he responded: \\\"Sir, what is the use of a new-born child?\\\".[99] For example, research into the effects of red light on the human eye's rod cells did not seem to have any practical purpose; eventually, the discovery that our night vision is not troubled by red light would lead search and rescue teams (among others) to adopt red light in the cockpits of jets and helicopters.[100]:106\ufffd10 Finally, even basic research can take unexpected turns, and there is some sense in which the scientific method is built to harness luck.\\r\\n\\r\\nScientific method\\r\\nMain article: Scientific method\\r\\n\\r\\nThe central star IRAS 10082-5647 was captured by the Advanced Camera for Surveys aboard the Hubble Space Telescope.\\r\\nScientific research involves using the scientific method, which seeks to objectively explain the events of nature in a reproducible way.[g] An explanatory thought experiment or hypothesis is put forward as explanation using principles such as parsimony (also known as \\\"Occam's Razor\\\") and are generally expected to seek consilience \ufffd fitting well with other accepted facts related to the phenomena.[101] This new explanation is used to make falsifiable predictions that are testable by experiment or observation. The predictions are to be posted before a confirming experiment or observation is sought, as proof that no tampering has occurred. Disproof of a prediction is evidence of progress.[h][i] This is done partly through observation of natural phenomena, but also through experimentation that tries to simulate natural events under controlled conditions as appropriate to the discipline (in the observational sciences, such as astronomy or geology, a predicted observation might take the place of a controlled experiment). Experimentation is especially important in science to help establish causal relationships (to avoid the correlation fallacy).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a hypothesis proves unsatisfactory, it is either modified or discarded.[102] If the hypothesis survived testing, it may become adopted into the framework of a scientific theory, a logically reasoned, self-consistent model or framework for describing the behavior of certain natural phenomena. A theory typically describes the behavior of much broader sets of phenomena than a hypothesis; commonly, a large number of hypotheses can be logically bound together by a single theory. Thus a theory is a hypothesis explaining various other hypotheses. In that vein, theories are formulated according to most of the same scientific principles as hypotheses. In addition to testing hypotheses, scientists may also generate a model, an attempt to describe or depict the phenomenon in terms of a logical, physical or mathematical representation and to generate new hypotheses that can be tested, based on observable phenomena.[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile performing experiments to test hypotheses, scientists may have a preference for one outcome over another, and so it is important to ensure that science as a whole can eliminate this bias.[104][105] This can be achieved by careful experimental design, transparency, and a thorough peer review process of the experimental results as well as any conclusions.[106][107] After the results of an experiment are announced or published, it is normal practice for independent researchers to double-check how the research was performed, and to follow up by performing similar experiments to determine how dependable the results might be.[108] Taken in its entirety, the scientific method allows for highly creative problem solving while minimizing any effects of subjective bias on the part of its users (especially the confirmation bias).[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nRole of mathematics\\r\\nMain articles: Mathematics and Formal science\\r\\n\\r\\nCalculus, the mathematics of continuous change, underpins many of the sciences.\\r\\nMathematics is essential in the formation of hypotheses, theories, and laws[110] in the natural and social sciences. For example, it is used in quantitative scientific modeling, which can generate new hypotheses and predictions to be tested. It is also used extensively in observing and collecting measurements. Statistics, a branch of mathematics, is used to summarize and analyze data, which allow scientists to assess the reliability and variability of their experimental results.\\r\\n\\r\\nComputational science applies computing power to simulate real-world situations, enabling a better understanding of scientific problems than formal mathematics alone can achieve. According to the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, computation is now as important as theory and experiment in advancing scientific knowledge.[111]\\r\\n\\r\\nVerifiability\\r\\nJohn Ziman points out that intersubjective verifiability is fundamental to the creation of all scientific knowledge.[112]:44 Ziman shows how scientists can identify patterns to each other across centuries; he refers to this ability as \\\"perceptual consensibility.\\\"[113]:46 He then makes consensibility, leading to consensus, the touchstone of reliable knowledge.[113]:104\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilosophy of science\\r\\nSee also: Philosophy of science\\r\\n\\r\\nEnglish philosopher and physician John Locke (1632\ufffd1704), a leading philosopher of British empiricism\\r\\nScientists usually take for granted a set of basic assumptions that are needed to justify the scientific method: (1) that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers; (2) that this objective reality is governed by natural laws; (3) that these laws can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation.[24] Philosophy of science seeks a deep understanding of what these underlying assumptions mean and whether they are valid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe belief that scientific theories should and do represent metaphysical reality is known as realism. It can be contrasted with anti-realism, the view that the success of science does not depend on it being accurate about unobservable entities such as electrons. One form of anti-realism is idealism, the belief that the mind or consciousness is the most basic essence, and that each mind generates its own reality.[j] In an idealistic world view, what is true for one mind need not be true for other minds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are different schools of thought in philosophy of science. The most popular position is empiricism,[k] which holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation and that scientific theories are the result of generalizations from such observations.[114] Empiricism generally encompasses inductivism, a position that tries to explain the way general theories can be justified by the finite number of observations humans can make and hence the finite amount of empirical evidence available to confirm scientific theories. This is necessary because the number of predictions those theories make is infinite, which means that they cannot be known from the finite amount of evidence using deductive logic only. Many versions of empiricism exist, with the predominant ones being Bayesianism[115] and the hypothetico-deductive method.[116]:236\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Austrian-British philosopher of science Karl Popper (1902\ufffd1994) in 1990. He is best known for his work on empirical falsification.\\r\\nEmpiricism has stood in contrast to rationalism, the position originally associated with Descartes, which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect, not by observation.[116]:20 Critical rationalism is a contrasting 20th-century approach to science, first defined by Austrian-British philosopher Karl Popper. Popper rejected the way that empiricism describes the connection between theory and observation. He claimed that theories are not generated by observation, but that observation is made in the light of theories and that the only way a theory can be affected by observation is when it comes in conflict with it.[116]:63\ufffd67 Popper proposed replacing verifiability with falsifiability as the landmark of scientific theories and replacing induction with falsification as the empirical method.[116]:68 Popper further claimed that there is actually only one universal method, not specific to science: the negative method of criticism, trial and error.[117] It covers all products of the human mind, including science, mathematics, philosophy, and art.[118]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother approach, instrumentalism, colloquially termed \\\"shut up and multiply,\\\"[119] emphasizes the utility of theories as instruments for explaining and predicting phenomena.[120] It views scientific theories as black boxes with only their input (initial conditions) and output (predictions) being relevant. Consequences, theoretical entities, and logical structure are claimed to be something that should simply be ignored and that scientists shouldn't make a fuss about (see interpretations of quantum mechanics). Close to instrumentalism is constructive empiricism, according to which the main criterion for the success of a scientific theory is whether what it says about observable entities is true.\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas Kuhn argued that the process of observation and evaluation takes place within a paradigm, a logically consistent \\\"portrait\\\" of the world that is consistent with observations made from its framing. He characterized normal science as the process of observation and \\\"puzzle solving\\\" which takes place within a paradigm, whereas revolutionary science occurs when one paradigm overtakes another in a paradigm shift.[121] Each paradigm has its own distinct questions, aims, and interpretations. The choice between paradigms involves setting two or more \\\"portraits\\\" against the world and deciding which likeness is most promising. A paradigm shift occurs when a significant number of observational anomalies arise in the old paradigm and a new paradigm makes sense of them. That is, the choice of a new paradigm is based on observations, even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm. For Kuhn, acceptance or rejection of a paradigm is a social process as much as a logical process. Kuhn's position, however, is not one of relativism.[122]\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, another approach often cited in debates of scientific skepticism against controversial movements like \\\"creation science\\\" is methodological naturalism. Its main point is that a difference between natural and supernatural explanations should be made and that science should be restricted methodologically to natural explanations.[l] That the restriction is merely methodological (rather than ontological) means that science should not consider supernatural explanations itself, but should not claim them to be wrong either. Instead, supernatural explanations should be left a matter of personal belief outside the scope of science. Methodological naturalism maintains that proper science requires strict adherence to empirical study and independent verification as a process for properly developing and evaluating explanations for observable phenomena.[123] The absence of these standards, arguments from authority, biased observational studies and other common fallacies are frequently cited by supporters of methodological naturalism as characteristic of the non-science they criticize.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainty and science\\r\\nA scientific theory is empirical[k][124] and is always open to falsification if new evidence is presented. That is, no theory is ever considered strictly certain as science accepts the concept of fallibilism.[m] The philosopher of science Karl Popper sharply distinguished truth from certainty. He wrote that scientific knowledge \\\"consists in the search for truth,\\\" but it \\\"is not the search for certainty ... All human knowledge is fallible and therefore uncertain.\\\"[125]:4\\r\\n\\r\\nNew scientific knowledge rarely results in vast changes in our understanding. According to psychologist Keith Stanovich, it may be the media's overuse of words like \\\"breakthrough\\\" that leads the public to imagine that science is constantly proving everything it thought was true to be false.[100]:119\ufffd38 While there are such famous cases as the theory of relativity that required a complete reconceptualization, these are extreme exceptions. Knowledge in science is gained by a gradual synthesis of information from different experiments by various researchers across different branches of science; it is more like a climb than a leap.[100]:123 Theories vary in the extent to which they have been tested and verified, as well as their acceptance in the scientific community.[n] For example, heliocentric theory, the theory of evolution, relativity theory, and germ theory still bear the name \\\"theory\\\" even though, in practice, they are considered factual.[126] Philosopher Barry Stroud adds that, although the best definition for \\\"knowledge\\\" is contested, being skeptical and entertaining the possibility that one is incorrect is compatible with being correct. Therefore, scientists adhering to proper scientific approaches will doubt themselves even once they possess the truth.[127] The fallibilist C. S. Peirce argued that inquiry is the struggle to resolve actual doubt and that merely quarrelsome, verbal, or hyperbolic doubt is fruitless[128] \ufffd but also that the inquirer should try to attain genuine doubt rather than resting uncritically on common sense.[129] He held that the successful sciences trust not to any single chain of inference (no stronger than its weakest link) but to the cable of multiple and various arguments intimately connected.[130]\\r\\n\\r\\nStanovich also asserts that science avoids searching for a \\\"magic bullet\\\"; it avoids the single-cause fallacy. This means a scientist would not ask merely \\\"What is the cause of ...\\\", but rather \\\"What are the most significant causes of ...\\\". This is especially the case in the more macroscopic fields of science (e.g. psychology, physical cosmology).[100]:141\ufffd47 Research often analyzes few factors at once, but these are always added to the long list of factors that are most important to consider.[100]:141\ufffd47 For example, knowing the details of only a person's genetics, or their history and upbringing, or the current situation may not explain a behavior, but a deep understanding of all these variables combined can be very predictive.\\r\\n\\r\\nFringe science, pseudoscience, and junk science\\r\\nAn area of study or speculation that masquerades as science in an attempt to claim a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is sometimes referred to as pseudoscience, fringe science, or junk science.[o] Physicist Richard Feynman coined the term \\\"cargo cult science\\\" for cases in which researchers believe they are doing science because their activities have the outward appearance of science but actually lack the \\\"kind of utter honesty\\\" that allows their results to be rigorously evaluated.[131] Various types of commercial advertising, ranging from hype to fraud, may fall into these categories.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere can also be an element of political or ideological bias on all sides of scientific debates. Sometimes, research may be characterized as \\\"bad science,\\\" research that may be well-intended but is actually incorrect, obsolete, incomplete, or over-simplified expositions of scientific ideas. The term \\\"scientific misconduct\\\" refers to situations such as where researchers have intentionally misrepresented their published data or have purposely given credit for a discovery to the wrong person.[132]\\r\\n\\r\\nScientific literature\\r\\nMain article: Scientific literature\\r\\n\\r\\nCover of the first volume of the scientific journal Science in 1880.\\r\\nScientific research is published in an enormous range of scientific literature.[133] Scientific journals communicate and document the results of research carried out in universities and various other research institutions, serving as an archival record of science. The first scientific journals, Journal des S\ufffdavans followed by the Philosophical Transactions, began publication in 1665. Since that time the total number of active periodicals has steadily increased. In 1981, one estimate for the number of scientific and technical journals in publication was 11,500.[134] The United States National Library of Medicine currently indexes 5,516 journals that contain articles on topics related to the life sciences. Although the journals are in 39 languages, 91 percent of the indexed articles are published in English.[135]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost scientific journals cover a single scientific field and publish the research within that field; the research is normally expressed in the form of a scientific paper. Science has become so pervasive in modern societies that it is generally considered necessary to communicate the achievements, news, and ambitions of scientists to a wider populace.\\r\\n\\r\\nScience magazines such as New Scientist, Science & Vie, and Scientific American cater to the needs of a much wider readership and provide a non-technical summary of popular areas of research, including notable discoveries and advances in certain fields of research. Science books engage the interest of many more people. Tangentially, the science fiction genre, primarily fantastic in nature, engages the public imagination and transmits the ideas, if not the methods, of science.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecent efforts to intensify or develop links between science and non-scientific disciplines such as literature or more specifically, poetry, include the Creative Writing Science resource developed through the Royal Literary Fund.[136]\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch\\tImpact\\r\\nStatic electricity and magnetism (c. 1600)\\r\\nElectric current (18th century)\\tAll electric appliances, dynamos, electric power stations, modern electronics, including electric lighting, television, electric heating, transcranial magnetic stimulation, deep brain stimulation, magnetic tape, loudspeaker, and the compass and lightning rod.\\r\\nDiffraction (1665)\\tOptics, hence fiber optic cable (1840s), modern intercontinental communications, and cable TV and internet\\r\\nGerm theory (1700)\\tHygiene, leading to decreased transmission of infectious diseases; antibodies, leading to techniques for disease diagnosis and targeted anticancer therapies.\\r\\nVaccination (1798)\\tLeading to the elimination of most infectious diseases from developed countries and the worldwide eradication of smallpox.\\r\\nPhotovoltaic effect (1839)\\tSolar cells (1883), hence solar power, solar powered watches, calculators and other devices.\\r\\nThe strange orbit of Mercury (1859) and other research\\r\\nleading to special (1905) and general relativity (1916)\\tSatellite-based technology such as GPS (1973), satnav and satellite communications[p]\\r\\nRadio waves (1887)\\tRadio had become used in innumerable ways beyond its better-known areas of telephony, and broadcast television (1927) and radio (1906) entertainment.

He also won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his work in theoretical physics.\\r\\nScientists are individuals who conduct scientific research to advance knowledge in an area of interest.[137][138] The term scientist was coined by William Whewell in 1833. In modern times, many professional scientists are trained in an academic setting and upon completion, attain an academic degree, with the highest degree being a doctorate such as a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD),[139] Doctor of Medicine (MD), or Doctor of Engineering (DEng). Many scientists pursue careers in various sectors of the economy such as academia, industry, government, and nonprofit environments.[140][141][142]\\r\\n\\r\\nScientists include experimentalists who mainly who perform experiments to test hypotheses and theoreticians who mainly develop new models to explain existing data and predict new results. Many have a desire to understand why the world is as we see it and how it came to be. They exhibit a strong curiosity about reality. Other motivations are recognition by their peers and prestige. The Nobel Prize, a widely regarded prestigious award,[143] is awarded annually to those who have achieved scientific advances in the fields of medicine, physics, chemistry, and economics. Some scientists have a desire to apply scientific knowledge for the benefit of people's health, nations, environment, or industries.\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen in science\\r\\nMain article: Women in science\\r\\nFurther information: Women in STEM fields\\r\\n\\r\\nMarie Curie was the first person to be awarded two Nobel Prizes: Physics in 1903 and Chemistry in 1911.[144]\\r\\nScience has historically been a male-dominated field, with some notable exceptions.[q] Women faced considerable discrimination in science, much as they did in other areas of male-dominated societies, such as frequently being passed over for job opportunities and denied credit for their work.[r] For example, Christine Ladd (1847\ufffd1930) was able to enter a PhD program as \\\"C. Ladd\\\"; Christine \\\"Kitty\\\" Ladd completed the requirements in 1882, but was awarded her degree only in 1926, after a career which spanned the algebra of logic (see truth table), color vision, and psychology. Her work preceded notable researchers like Ludwig Wittgenstein and Charles Sanders Peirce. The achievements of women in science have been attributed to their defiance of their traditional role as laborers within the domestic sphere.[145]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 20th century, active recruitment of women and elimination of institutional discrimination on the basis of sex greatly increased the number of women scientists, but large gender disparities remain in some fields; over half of new biologists are female, while 80% of PhDs in physics are given to men.[citation needed] Feminists claim this is the result of culture rather than an innate difference between the sexes, and some experiments have shown that parents challenge and explain more to boys than girls, asking them to reflect more deeply and logically.[146]: 258\ufffd61. In the early part of the 21st century, women in the United States earned 50.3% of bachelor's degrees, 45.6% of master's degrees, and 40.7% of PhDs in science and engineering fields. They earned more than half of the degrees in psychology (about 70%), social sciences (about 50%), and biology (about 50-60%) but earned less than half the degrees in the physical sciences, earth sciences, mathematics, engineering, and computer science.[147] Lifestyle choice also plays a major role in female engagement in science; women with young children are 28% less likely to take tenure-track positions due to work-life balance issues,[148] and female graduate students' interest in careers in research declines dramatically over the course of graduate school, whereas that of their male colleagues remains unchanged.[149]\\r\\n\\r\\nLearned societies\\r\\nFurther information: Learned society\\r\\n\\r\\nPhysicists in front of the Royal Society building in London (1952).\\r\\nLearned societies for the communication and promotion of scientific thought and experimentation have existed since the Renaissance.[150] Many scientists belong to a learned society that promotes their respective scientific discipline, profession, or group of related disciplines.[151] Membership may be open to all, may require possession of some qualifications, or may be an honor conferred by election.[152] Membership often requires possession of some scientific credentials, or may be an honor conferred by election. Most scientific societies are non-profit organizations, and many are professional associations. Their activities typically include holding regular conferences for the presentation and discussion of new research results and publishing or sponsoring academic journals in their discipline. Some also act as professional bodies, regulating the activities of their members in the public interest or the collective interest of the membership. Scholars in the sociology of science[who?] argue that learned societies are of key importance and their formation assists in the emergence and development of new disciplines or professions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe professionalization of science, begun in the 19th century, was partly enabled by the creation of distinguished academy of sciences in a number of countries such as the Italian Accademia dei Lincei in 1603,[153] the British Royal Society in 1660, the French Acad\ufffdmie des Sciences in 1666,[154] the American National Academy of Sciences in 1863, the German Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in 1911, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1928. International scientific organizations, such as the International Council for Science, have since been formed to promote cooperation between the scientific communities of different nations.\\r\\n\\r\\nScience and the public\\r\\n\\\"Science and society\\\" redirects here. For the academic journal, see Science & Society.\\r\\nScience policy\\r\\nMain articles: Science policy, History of science policy, and Economics of science\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United Nations Global Science-Policy-Business Forum on the Environment in Nairobi, Kenya (2017).\\r\\nScience policy is an area of public policy concerned with the policies that affect the conduct of the scientific enterprise, including research funding, often in pursuance of other national policy goals such as technological innovation to promote commercial product development, weapons development, health care and environmental monitoring. Science policy also refers to the act of applying scientific knowledge and consensus to the development of public policies. Science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve the natural sciences. In accordance with public policy being concerned about the well-being of its citizens, science policy's goal is to consider how science and technology can best serve the public.\\r\\n\\r\\nState policy has influenced the funding of public works and science for thousands of years, particularly within civilizations with highly organized governments such as imperial China and the Roman Empire. Prominent historical examples include the Great Wall of China, completed over the course of two millennia through the state support of several dynasties, and the Grand Canal of the Yangtze River, an immense feat of hydraulic engineering begun by Sunshu Ao (??? 7th c. BCE), Ximen Bao (??? 5th c.BCE), and Shi Chi (4th c. BCE). This construction dates from the 6th century BCE under the Sui Dynasty and is still in use today. In China, such state-supported infrastructure and scientific research projects date at least from the time of the Mohists, who inspired the study of logic during the period of the Hundred Schools of Thought and the study of defensive fortifications like the Great Wall of China during the Warring States period.\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic policy can directly affect the funding of capital equipment and intellectual infrastructure for industrial research by providing tax incentives to those organizations that fund research. Vannevar Bush, director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development for the United States government, the forerunner of the National Science Foundation, wrote in July 1945 that \\\"Science is a proper concern of government.\\\"[155]\\r\\n\\r\\nFunding of science\\r\\nMain article: Funding of science\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Main Entomology Building in Australia\\r\\nScientific research is often funded through a competitive process in which potential research projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive funding. Such processes, which are run by government, corporations, or foundations, allocate scarce funds. Total research funding in most developed countries is between 1.5% and 3% of GDP.[156] In the OECD, around two-thirds of research and development in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry, and 20% and 10% respectively by universities and government. The government funding proportion in certain industries is higher, and it dominates research in social science and humanities. Similarly, with some exceptions (e.g. biotechnology) government provides the bulk of the funds for basic scientific research. Many governments have dedicated agencies to support scientific research. Prominent scientific organizations include the National Science Foundation in the United States, the National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Argentina, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia, Centre national de la recherche scientifique in France, the Max Planck Society and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft in Germany, and CSIC in Spain. In commercial research and development, all but the most research-oriented corporations focus more heavily on near-term commercialisation possibilities rather than \\\"blue-sky\\\" ideas or technologies (such as nuclear fusion).\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic awareness of science\\r\\nMain article: Public awareness of science\\r\\nFurther information: Science outreach and Science communication\\r\\n\\r\\nDinosaur exhibit in the Houston Museum of Natural Science\\r\\nThe public awareness of science relates to the attitudes, behaviors, opinions, and activities that make up the relations between science and the general public. it integrates various themes and activities such as science communication, science museums, science festivals, science fairs, citizen science, and science in popular culture. Social scientists have devised various metrics to measure the public understanding of science such as factual knowledge, self-reported knowledge, and structural knowledge.[157][158]\\r\\n\\r\\nScience journalism\\r\\nMain article: Science journalism\\r\\nThe mass media face a number of pressures that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims in terms of their credibility within the scientific community as a whole. Determining how much weight to give different sides in a scientific debate may require considerable expertise regarding the matter.[159] Few journalists have real scientific knowledge, and even beat reporters who know a great deal about certain scientific issues may be ignorant about other scientific issues that they are suddenly asked to cover.[160][161]\\r\\n\\r\\nPoliticization of science\\r\\nMain article: Politicization of science\\r\\n\\r\\nResults of seven papers from 2004\ufffd2015 assessing the overwhelming scientific consensus on man-made global warming (see Surveys of scientists' views on climate change), in contrast to the political controversy over this issue, particularly in the United States.\\r\\nPoliticization of science occurs when government, business, or advocacy groups use legal or economic pressure to influence the findings of scientific research or the way it is disseminated, reported, or interpreted. Many factors can act as facets of the politicization of science such as populist anti-intellectualism, perceived threats to religious beliefs, postmodernist subjectivism, and fear for business interests.[162] Politicization of science is usually accomplished when scientific information is presented in a way that emphasizes the uncertainty associated with the scientific evidence.[163] Tactics such as shifting conversation, failing to acknowledge facts, and capitalizing on doubt of scientific consensus have been used to gain more attention for views that have been undermined by scientific evidence.[164] Examples of issues that have involved the politicization of science include the global warming controversy, health effects of pesticides, and health effects of tobacco.[164][165]\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"evals\":[],\"id\":-2067386457},{\"title\":\"technology\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools.

Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's environment. Innovations have always influenced the values of a society and raised new questions of the ethics of technology. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of the term \\\"technology\\\" has changed significantly over the last 200 years. Before the 20th century, the term was uncommon in English, and it was used either to refer to the description or study of the useful arts[3] or to allude to technical education, as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (chartered in 1861).[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\\"technology\\\" rose to prominence in the 20th century in connection with the Second Industrial Revolution. The term's meanings changed in the early 20th century when American social scientists, beginning with Thorstein Veblen, translated ideas from the German concept of Technik into \\\"technology.\\\" In German and other European languages, a distinction exists between technik and technologie that is absent in English, which usually translates both terms as \\\"technology.\\\" By the 1930s, \\\"technology\\\" referred not only to the study of the industrial arts but to the industrial arts themselves.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1937, the American sociologist Read Bain wrote that \\\"technology includes all tools, machines, utensils, weapons, instruments, housing, clothing, communicating and transporting devices and the skills by which we produce and use them.\\\"[6] Bain's definition remains common among scholars today, especially social scientists. Scientists and engineers usually prefer to define technology as applied science, rather than as the things that people make and use.[7] More recently, scholars have borrowed from European philosophers of \\\"technique\\\" to extend the meaning of technology to various forms of instrumental reason, as in Foucault's work on technologies of the self (techniques de soi).\\r\\n\\r\\nDictionaries and scholars have offered a variety of definitions. The Merriam-Webster Learner's Dictionary offers a definition of the term: \\\"the use of science in industry, engineering, etc., to invent useful things or to solve problems\\\" and \\\"a machine, piece of equipment, method, etc., that is created by technology.\\\"[8] Ursula Franklin, in her 1989 \\\"Real World of Technology\\\" lecture, gave another definition of the concept; it is \\\"practice, the way we do things around here.\\\"[9] The term is often used to imply a specific field of technology, or to refer to high technology or just consumer electronics, rather than technology as a whole.[10] Bernard Stiegler, in Technics and Time, 1, defines technology in two ways: as \\\"the pursuit of life by means other than life,\\\" and as \\\"organized inorganic matter.\\\"[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnology can be most broadly defined as the entities, both material and immaterial, created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value. In this usage, technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve real-world problems. It is a far-reaching term that may include simple tools, such as a crowbar or wooden spoon, or more complex machines, such as a space station or particle accelerator. Tools and machines need not be material; virtual technology, such as computer software and business methods, fall under this definition of technology.[12] W. Brian Arthur defines technology in a similarly broad way as \\\"a means to fulfill a human purpose.\\\"[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word \\\"technology\\\" can also be used to refer to a collection of techniques. In this context, it is the current state of humanity's knowledge of how to combine resources to produce desired products, to solve problems, fulfill needs, or satisfy wants; it includes technical methods, skills, processes, techniques, tools and raw materials. When combined with another term, such as \\\"medical technology\\\" or \\\"space technology,\\\" it refers to the state of the respective field's knowledge and tools. \\\"State-of-the-art technology\\\" refers to the high technology available to humanity in any field.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe invention of integrated circuits and the microprocessor (here, an Intel 4004 chip from 1971) led to the modern computer revolution.\\r\\nTechnology can be viewed as an activity that forms or changes culture.[14] Additionally, technology is the application of math, science, and the arts for the benefit of life as it is known. A modern example is the rise of communication technology, which has lessened barriers to human interaction and as a result has helped spawn new subcultures; the rise of cyberculture has at its basis the development of the Internet and the computer.[15] Not all technology enhances culture in a creative way; technology can also help facilitate political oppression and war via tools such as guns. As a cultural activity, technology predates both science and engineering, each of which formalize some aspects of technological endeavor.\\r\\n\\r\\naspects of technological endeavor.\\r\\n\\r\\nScience, engineering and technology\\r\\n\\r\\nAntoine Lavoisier conducting an experiment with combustion generated by amplified sun light\\r\\nThe distinction between science, engineering, and technology is not always clear. Science is systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation.[16] Technologies are not usually exclusively products of science, because they have to satisfy requirements such as utility, usability, and safety.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nEngineering is the goal-oriented process of designing and making tools and systems to exploit natural phenomena for practical human means, often (but not always) using results and techniques from science. The development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge, including scientific, engineering, mathematical, linguistic, and historical knowledge, to achieve some practical result.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnology is often a consequence of science and engineering, although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields. For example, science might study the flow of electrons in electrical conductors by using already-existing tools and knowledge. This new-found knowledge may then be used by engineers to create new tools and machines such as semiconductors, computers, and other forms of advanced technology. In this sense, scientists and engineers may both be considered technologists; the three fields are often considered as one for the purposes of research and reference.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exact relations between science and technology in particular have been debated by scientists, historians, and policymakers in the late 20th century, in part because the debate can inform the funding of basic and applied science. In the immediate wake of World War II, for example, it was widely considered in the United States that technology was simply \\\"applied science\\\" and that to fund basic science was to reap technological results in due time. An articulation of this philosophy could be found explicitly in Vannevar Bush's treatise on postwar science policy, Science \ufffd The Endless Frontier: \\\"New products, new industries, and more jobs require continuous additions to knowledge of the laws of nature ... This essential new knowledge can be obtained only through basic scientific research.\\\"[18] In the late-1960s, however, this view came under direct attack, leading towards initiatives to fund science for specific tasks (initiatives resisted by the scientific community). The issue remains contentious, though most analysts resist the model that technology simply is a result of scientific research.[19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"evals\":[],\"id\":-876433920},{\"title\":\"world\",\"link\":null,\"guid\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"categories\":[],\"author\":null,\"thumbnail\":null,\"description\":\"Although in most of the English-speaking world this field is not usually regarded as a specific specialization for journalists, it is so in nearly all the world.

For journalism, it is a branch that deals with news either sent by foreign correspondents or news agencies, or \ufffd more recently \ufffd information that is gathered or researched through distance communication technologies, such as telephone, satellite TV or the internet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough in most of the English-speaking world this field is not usually regarded as a specific specialization for journalists, it is so in nearly all the world. Particularly in the United States, there is a blurred distinction between world news and \\\"national\\\" news when they include directly the national government or national institutions, such as wars in which the US are involved or summits of multilateral organizations in which the US are a member.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the birth of modern journalism, most news were foreign, as registered by the courants of the 17th century in West and Central Europe, such as the Daily Courant (England), the Nieuwe Tijudinger (Antwerp), the Relation (Strasbourg), the Avisa Relation oder Zeitung (Wolfenb\ufffdttel) and the Courante Uyt Italien, Duytsland & C. (Amsterdam). Since these papers were aimed at bankers and merchants, they brought mostly news from other markets, which usually meant other nations. In any case, it is worthy to remark that nation-states were still incipient in 17th-century Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the 19th century on, with newspapers already established in Europe, the United States and a few other countries, innovations in telecommunications such as the telegraph made news from abroad easier to be spread. The first news agencies were then founded, like AFP (France), Reuters (UK), Wolff (currently DPA, Germany) and the AP (US).\\r\\n\\r\\nWar journalism is one of the best known subfields of world news (although war coverage can be national for the media of belligerent countries themselves).\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are essentially two types of reporters who do foreign reporting: the foreign correspondent (full-time reporter employed by a news source) and the special envoy (sent abroad to cover a specific subject, temporarily stationed in a location).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe correspondent is a reporter based in a foreign city (often the capital of a country) covering a region, a country or sometimes even an entire continent. He or she regularly files stories to the news editor. He\/she gathers materials for these stories from local officials, members of the community, and the local media, as well as from events he\/she directly witnesses. Correspondents typically stay in touch with the local community and maintain contacts with other journalists and correspondents in order to identify strategic sources in the government, among diplomats, members of the military and other organizations on the ground who may provide important information.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of foreign correspondents has dropped significantly over the past 20 years or more. Often, a media company is either uninterested or unable to afford to support a single correspondent, such as in many developing countries. In some places, they cannot obtain visas due to political constraints, or otherwise dangerous conditions prohibit a media company from stationing a reporter there. In recent years, the drop in foreign correspondents has been due to cutbacks within media companies (often, but not always, a result of economics alone).[1] Among English language newspapers, only eight daily newspapers have full-time correspondents in more than ten foreign stations, four from the US, three from the UK and one from India:\\r\\n\\r\\n35 \ufffd Wall Street Journal (US): Baghdad, Bangkok, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Brussels, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Istanbul, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, Kuala Lumpur, Lagos, London, Manila, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, Paris, Prague, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, S\ufffdo Paulo, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Taipei, Tokyo, Toronto, Zurich\\r\\n\\r\\n24 \ufffd New York Times (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Cairo, Caracas, Dakar, Hong Kong, Islamabad, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Rome, S\ufffdo Paulo, Shanghai, Tokyo\\r\\n\\r\\n19 \ufffd Financial Times (UK): Beijing, Berlin, Bombay, Brussels, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, New York, Paris, Taipei, Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney, Washington\\r\\n\\r\\n17 \ufffd Washington Post (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Berlin, Bogot\ufffd, Cairo, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Shanghai, Tehran, Tokyo\\r\\n\\r\\n15 \ufffd The Guardian (UK): Accra, Bangkok, Beijing, Berlin, Brussels, Kabul, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Los Angeles, Madrid, New York, Paris, Rome, Tehran, Tokyo\\r\\n\\r\\n13 \ufffd The Daily Telegraph (UK): Beijing, Brussels, Jerusalem, Kabul, Los Angeles, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, New York, Paris, Shanghai, Sydney, Washington\\r\\n\\r\\n13 \ufffd Los Angeles Times (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Cairo, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, New Delhi, Seoul\\r\\n\\r\\n12 \ufffd The Hindu (India): Addis Ababa, Beijing, Colombo, Dhaka, Dubai, Islamabad, Kathmandu, London, Moscow, Paris, Singapore, Washington\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen reporters working abroad have no permanent labor contract with media outlets, they are called stringers.

To the naked eye, they are not much to look at \u2014 a few teeth, bits of bone. \\r\\nBut the fossils contain DNA dating back tens of thousands of years. That genetic material shows that Denisovans were a distinct branch of human evolution, a lost lineage.\\r\\nAt some point in the distant past, the Denisovans disappeared \u2014 but not before interbreeding with modern humans. Today, people in places like East Asia and New Guinea still carry fragments of Denisovan DNA.\\r\\nOne of the biggest obstacles to understanding the Denisovans is their age. Standard methods for dating these fossils have left scientists perplexed.\\r\\n\u201cEveryone said, \u2018These Denisovans, we have no idea how old they are,\u2019\u201d said Katerina Douka, an archaeologist at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Germany. \\r\\nOver the past six years, Dr. Douka and other experts have been creating a sort of history of the Denisova Cave. They have dated 103 layers of sediment on the cave floor, as well as 50 items found in them, including bones, pieces of charcoal and tools.\\r\\nThe scientists unveiled this chronology in a pair of papers published on Wednesday. That timeline shows that humans occupied the cave for perhaps as long as 300,000 years. And it raises some intriguing hints that Denisovans may have been capable of sophisticated thought, on par with modern humans.\\r\\nIn an accompanying commentary, Robin Dennell of the University of Exeter in England wrote that Dr. Douka and her colleagues have created \u201ca rigorous and compelling timeline.\u201d\\r\\nDenisova Cave sits about 30 yards above the Anuy River. The cave has a large main chamber with a high ceiling; from there, passageways lead to smaller chambers. Over the past few hundred thousand years, sediment has slowly built up on the cave floor.\\r\\nIn the 1970s, Russian scientists began digging into that sediment, finding fossils of animals like hyenas and bears, fragments of humanlike bones and thousands of stone tools, as well as bracelets, beads and other ornaments.\\r\\nIn 2010, researchers at the Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Anthropology announced they had found DNA in teeth and bones from the cave. In addition to Denisovan DNA, they found a few bone fragments that contained Neanderthal DNA.\\r\\nBy comparing the mutations in this DNA, the scientists got a better sense of how Denisovans and Neanderthals fit into the human family tree. \\r\\nAs it turned out, modern humans share a common ancestor with Denisovans and Neanderthals that lived roughly 600,000 years ago. Later \u2014 approximately 400,000 years ago \u2014 the Neanderthal and Denisovan lineages split.\\r\\nEver since the digging began, Russian researchers have carefully mapped the sedimentary layers in which they found bones and tools. They tried to estimate the ages of the layers, but \u201cthe dates were all over the place,\u201d said Dr. Douka.\\r\\nShe and her colleagues at the University of Oxford are experts on determining the age of carbon. Researchers from the University of Wollongong in Australia tried an alternate method called optical dating.\\r\\nThe researchers combined results from the two methods to assemble a single chronology of the cave. The findings are largely in agreement: \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a unified story,\u201d said Zenobia Jacobs, an archaeologist at the University of Wollongong.\\r\\nThe earliest signs of human life in the cave \u2014 simple stone tools \u2014 are more than 287,000 years old. The tools alone cannot tell us if those first people were Denisovans or Neanderthals. \\r\\nBut they are not the style known to be made by Neanderthals, suggesting Denisovans may have been the creators.\\r\\nIt\u2019s not until about 200,000 years ago that the oldest Denisovan DNA comes to light. The researchers estimated it to be between 217,000 and 185,000 years old. A Neanderthal DNA sample comes from a layer that formed between 205,000 and 172,000 years ago.\\r\\nIn the millenniums that followed, both Denisovans and Neanderthals left more genetic evidence in the cave. It may have been continually occupied for thousands of years by one group, then abandoned and reoccupied by others.\\r\\nBut Neanderthals and Denisovans must have overlapped at least once during those tens of thousands of years. \\r\\nIn August, researchers reported a bone fragment from a girl whose mother was a Neanderthal and father was a Denisovan. In the new study, researchers estimate that this hybrid child lived between 79,100 and 118,100 years ago.\\r\\nThe researchers found no Neanderthal remains in more recent layers of the cave floor \u2014 only Denisovan. A Denisovan tooth dates back to between 55,300 and 84,100 years ago; a Denisovan chip of bone is 51,600 to 76,200 years old.\\r\\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\\r\\nParadoxically, the most recent parts of the cave have yielded some of its biggest mysteries. \\r\\nStarting around 45,000 years ago, new kinds of artifacts begin showing up in the cave floor. They include pointed pieces of bone, as well as ornaments like stone bracelets and beads. One possibility is that these new tools were made by newly arrived modern humans. \\r\\nModern humans evolved in Africa and then expanded out to other continents. They may have made it to what is now Siberia: One human fossil discovered there dates to about 45,000 years ago.\\r\\nBut Michael Shunkov, a co-author of the new studies and the director of Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography at the Russian Academy of Sciences, disagrees with that interpretation. \\r\\nThe sophisticated tools in the Denisova Cave show \u201cno clear indications for outside influences,\u201d he said in an email. Instead, Dr. Shunkov believes that the Denisovans who occupied the cave for perhaps 250,000 years developed this technology on their own.\\r\\nOne way to resolve this question would be to find human fossils from that period. \\r\\nDr. Douka and her colleagues have discovered a bone dating back between 45,900 and 50,000 years ago that contains humanlike proteins \u2014 but no DNA.

I heard that \u201cnatural flavors\u201d added to flavored seltzer water are not natural, because of a loophole in the regulations covering additives. Is that true?\\r\\nA. Government regulations define natural flavors as those that derive their aroma or flavor chemicals from plant or animal sources, including fruit, meat, fish, spices, herbs, roots, leaves, buds or bark that are distilled, fermented or otherwise manipulated in a lab. This distinguishes them from artificial flavors, which use man-made chemicals to give a product its particular flavor or aroma. \\r\\nThe loophole, as it were, is that for nonorganic foods, the regulations do not restrict the dozens of other ingredients like preservatives and solvents that can go into a so-called natural flavor. Ultimately, because of the wide variety of ingredients that typically go into \u201cnatural\u201d flavorings, \u201cthere does not seem to be much of a difference between natural and artificial flavors,\u201d said David Andrews, a scientist at the Environmental Working Group, a research and advocacy organization.\\r\\nWhile food processors must list all of the ingredients on a food label, flavor manufacturers do not have to disclose their ingredients. They can add synthetic solvents, preservatives, emulsifiers, carriers and other additives to a flavor that qualifies as natural under current regulations. Natural flavors allowed for use in certified organic foods are subject to a different, far more restrictive set of regulations. They cannot contain a long list of ingredients, including synthetic solvents, carriers and emulsifiers or artificial preservatives, said Gwendolyn Wyard, the Organic Trade Association\u2019s vice president of regulatory and technical affairs.

The commission, under new leadership, rolled the rules back in 2017.\\r\\nThe plaintiffs in the suit, led by the internet company Mozilla and supported by 22 state attorneys general, say the commission lacked a sound legal reason for scrapping the regulations. The government was expected to argue that the rules were repealed because of the burden they imposed on broadband providers like Verizon and Comcast.\\r\\nThe case, before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, could wind through the courts for years. If the commission loses, it might try to rewrite its order rolling back the rules to avoid further legal challenges.\\r\\nThe case is just one front in the fight over net neutrality. Here are two other forums where the subject continues to be fiercely debated.\\r\\nIn the States\\r\\nImmediately after the commission voted to repeal the rules, state officials jumped into action. More than 30 states have introduced bills to add their own net neutrality protections. Nine, including California, New York, Rhode Island and Washington, have approved such regulations.\\r\\nThat means people in those states are theoretically protected against moves by companies like AT&T and Charter that block or slow some web traffic. California even bans promotions for free streaming apps, a practice that can stifle the businesses of other websites that do not have the resources to offer such promotions. \\r\\nBut court battles have complicated the enforcement of the laws. California\u2019s attorney general said the state would not enforce its rules until the federal appeals court ruled on the challenge to the commission\u2019s 2017 repeal.\\r\\nThe state laws are being challenged in lawsuits filed by the Justice Department and USTelecom, the telecommunications industry\u2019s main trade group.\\r\\nIn repealing the net neutrality rules, the commission included a provision barring states from creating their own regulations. The goal was to avoid a patchwork of rules across the country. Traditionally, states had authority over telecommunications within their borders, but companies and the federal government have argued that the internet\u2019s global nature makes it harder to regulate state by state. \\r\\nIn Congress\\r\\nMembers of Congress are expected to introduce net neutrality laws this year that would create nationwide rules, overriding whatever states have adopted. Democrats are pushing the issue, and some Republicans have voiced support for minimal rules.\\r\\nAny legislation is unlikely to pass this year, with Republicans still controlling the Senate. But net neutrality will certainly continue to be a political talking point. It became a campaign issue in the 2018 midterms for Democrats, and the party sees it as a winning issue, particularly among young voters, heading toward the 2020 presidential election.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-582939649,\"description\":\"A lawsuit challenging the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s repeal of rules meant to ensure internet users open access to all websites and services is one of several fronts in a broader battle.\\r\",\"title\":\"Net Neutrality Repeal at Stake as Key Court Case Starts\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"technology.13.txt\"}],\"labelMap\":[[-1470032073,\"technology\"],[1620813714,\"science\"],[391006090,\"world\"],[1668447843,\"technology\"],[-1492412555,\"world\"],[-1004715158,\"technology\"],[-727259249,\"technology\"],[1884837133,\"technology\"],[-1501740769,\"technology\"],[-634690071,\"business\"],[1125083330,\"world\"],[1229292121,\"world\"],[411863084,\"technology\"],[-1361980079,\"world\"],[489669537,\"technology\"],[-1709632295,\"technology\"],[326879815,\"technology\"],[650611067,\"world\"],[494067761,\"technology\"],[1957449218,\"technology\"],[-582939649,\"technology\"],[-1116953762,\"health\"],[-1521949661,\"world\"],[-1309279343,\"world\"],[-1781385766,\"technology\"]],\"confusionMatrix\":[[0,0,0,3,1],[0,0,0,2,2],[0,0,0,3,1],[0,0,1,3,0],[1,0,0,1,3]],\"confusionLabels\":[\"business\",\"health\",\"science\",\"technology\",\"world\"],\"relabelingLabelMap\":[[-1781385766,\"technology\"],[-1309279343,\"world\"],[-1116953762,\"health\"],[-582939649,\"technology\"],[494067761,\"health\"],[650611067,\"technology\"],[326879815,\"science\"],[-1709632295,\"business\"],[489669537,\"world\"],[411863084,\"world\"],[1125083330,\"science\"],[-634690071,\"health\"],[-1501740769,\"technology\"],[-727259249,\"technology\"],[-1492412555,\"world\"],[1668447843,\"business\"],[1792994965,\"health\"],[-2122718852,\"health\"],[-164165755,\"health\"],[1028732566,\"health\"],[1705918815,\"health\"],[-1222156594,\"world\"]],\"accuracy\":0.32,\"correctRelabeled\":[-582939649],\"labelingPrecision\":0.25,\"labelingRecall\":0.058823529411764705,\"correctAssignedItems\":[-1116953762,-582939649],\"assignmentPrecision\":0.25,\"openedItems\":[],\"numOpenedItems\":0,\"selectedItems\":[],\"selectedInCategory\":0,\"selectionRecall\":null},{\"modelOperation\":\"update\",\"changedFiles\":[{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Katherine Leon was 38 and living in Alexandria, Va., when she gave birth to her second son in 2003. She was discharged from the hospital, but instead of getting better, she recalls, she kept feeling \u201cworse and worse and worse.\u201d\\r\\nFive weeks after she had her child, Ms. Leon\u2019s husband came back early from work and found her barely able to breathe. \u201cI hate to use the word panic, because so many people say if it\u2019s a woman she is just having a panic attack, but I was terrified,\u201d she said.\\r\\nHer husband called 911, and she was taken to the emergency room where, after a few tests, the physicians told her there was nothing wrong with her. She went home but continued to have bouts of chest pain and kept laboring to breathe.\\r\\nThings came to a head several days later, she said, when she developed \u201cthat impending doom feeling.\u201d Reluctantly, she called 911 again. Things went differently in the emergency room this time.\\r\\n\u201cThere was a young woman doctor who took care of me,\u201d said Ms. Leon. \u201cHer reaction was totally different. She knew that there was something definitely wrong.\u201d\\r\\nA few days later, she underwent an explorative cardiac catheterization procedure and received a devastating diagnosis: She had a critical blockage in the main artery supplying her heart. She would need emergency heart bypass surgery.\\r\\nShe remembers thinking at the time: \u201cAre you kidding me? I have two babies and I was going to do the whole mom thing, with playgroups and a jog stroller, and take classes. I may have tried one cigarette in my life. I didn\u2019t have cholesterol issues. I didn\u2019t have blood pressure issues.\u201d\\r\\nShe received what at the time was considered one of the rarest possible diagnoses: spontaneous coronary artery dissection, or SCAD. The condition occurs when one of the arteries supplying the heart with oxygen spontaneously tears open, leading to a heart attack that can sometimes be fatal. It occurs most often in women, and can be exacerbated by pregnancy.\\r\\nBut at the time, few doctors knew that SCAD even existed, or knew much about it. \u201cYou are never going to meet anyone else who has this,\u201d Ms. Leon remembers one doctor telling her. Another told her, \u201cYou need to move on and enjoy your children.\u201d\\r\\nHer doctors also told her that the only thing she could do to avoid SCAD in the future was to never get pregnant again. But seeking to learn more about the disease that had almost taken her life, she went online and started to find other women with similar symptoms around the world.\\r\\nIn 2009, Ms. Leon went to the WomenHeart Science and Leadership Symposium at the Mayo Clinic, where she met Dr. Sharonne N. Hayes, a professor of cardiovascular medicine at Mayo. At that time, the largest study on SCAD included 43 patients. \u201cI walked up to Dr. Hayes and told her we had 70 people, and we wanted research,\u201d Ms. Leon recalled. \u201cShe was like, \u2018Wow.\u2019\u201d\\r\\n\u201cEverything I learned about SCAD in my medical training was wrong,\u201d Dr. Hayes said.\\r\\nBy 2010, with the help of Dr. Hayes, and subsequently SCAD Research Inc., an organization founded by Bob Alico, who lost his wife to SCAD, Dr. Hayes devised an innovative way to do research, using online networks of far-flung patients and analyzing genetic and clinical data. \u201cWe never imagined there would be 1,000 female patients in our virtual registry,\u201d Dr. Hayes said.\\r\\nThat fortuitous meeting between Ms. Leon and Dr. Hayes has helped transform SCAD from being an unknown, unrecognized condition to something all physicians are taught about during medical school and in later training. SCAD is now recognized as the most common cause of heart attacks in women under 40.\\r\\nWhy did it take so long for physicians and researchers to recognize SCAD? The most important reason might have been that the condition predominantly affects women. \u201cWe listen less well to women,\u201d said Dr. Hayes. \u201cWe are much more likely to associate their symptoms with psychological causes.\u201d A heart attack is more likely to be fatal in a young woman than a young man, perhaps because women\u2019s cardiac symptoms are more often misattributed to anxiety or depression than men\u2019s.\\r\\nThe bias that many women feel they face in the clinic or the emergency room has led some, like Ms. Leon, to take action and advocate for themselves and others. \u201cPeople are activated by injustice, by unanswered questions,\u201d said Dr. Hayes\\r\\nShe offers this advice: \u201cDon\u2019t walk out of a doctor\u2019s office without answers. Find a doctor who is committed to listening to you and does not think they know everything about anything.\u201d\\r\\nThe story of SCAD underscores how much we doctors still don\u2019t understand, including about heart disease in women. Too often those in the medical profession downplay women\u2019s complaints, telling them nothing is wrong. Women are often expected to take care of others but too often neglect themselves. Indeed, women take much longer to seek medical care for a heart attack than men. As we embrace new technologies to peer ever deeper inside the human body to find answers, perhaps the better route might be simply to attend to the patient in front of us. Often what we need to do is listen.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":494067761,\"description\":\"The story of SCAD underscores how much doctors still don\u2019t understand, including about heart disease in women.\\r\",\"title\":\"Doctors: How One Woman Changed What Doctors Know About Heart Attacks\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"health.9.txt\"}],\"labelMap\":[[-1470032073,\"technology\"],[1620813714,\"science\"],[391006090,\"world\"],[1668447843,\"technology\"],[-1492412555,\"world\"],[-1004715158,\"technology\"],[-727259249,\"technology\"],[1884837133,\"technology\"],[-1501740769,\"health\"],[-634690071,\"business\"],[1125083330,\"world\"],[1229292121,\"world\"],[411863084,\"technology\"],[-1361980079,\"world\"],[489669537,\"health\"],[-1709632295,\"technology\"],[326879815,\"technology\"],[650611067,\"world\"],[494067761,\"health\"],[1957449218,\"technology\"],[-582939649,\"technology\"],[-1116953762,\"health\"],[-1521949661,\"world\"],[-1309279343,\"world\"],[-1781385766,\"technology\"]],\"confusionMatrix\":[[0,0,0,3,1],[0,0,0,1,2],[0,1,0,2,1],[0,1,1,2,0],[1,0,0,1,3]],\"confusionLabels\":[\"business\",\"health\",\"science\",\"technology\",\"world\"],\"relabelingLabelMap\":[[-1781385766,\"technology\"],[-1309279343,\"world\"],[-1116953762,\"health\"],[-582939649,\"technology\"],[494067761,\"health\"],[650611067,\"technology\"],[326879815,\"science\"],[-1709632295,\"business\"],[489669537,\"world\"],[411863084,\"world\"],[1125083330,\"science\"],[-634690071,\"health\"],[-1501740769,\"technology\"],[-727259249,\"technology\"],[-1492412555,\"world\"],[1668447843,\"business\"],[1792994965,\"health\"],[-2122718852,\"health\"],[-164165755,\"health\"],[1028732566,\"health\"],[1705918815,\"health\"],[-1222156594,\"world\"]],\"accuracy\":0.32,\"correctRelabeled\":[-582939649,494067761],\"labelingPrecision\":0.4,\"labelingRecall\":0.11764705882352941,\"correctAssignedItems\":[-1116953762,-582939649,494067761],\"assignmentPrecision\":0.4,\"openedItems\":[],\"numOpenedItems\":0,\"selectedItems\":[],\"selectedInCategory\":0,\"selectionRecall\":null},{\"modelOperation\":\"add\",\"changedFiles\":[{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"The partial government shutdown ended last week after 35 days, but conservationists have warned that its impact may be felt for hundreds of years in at least one part of the country: Joshua Tree National Park.\\r\\nThe Southern California park, which is larger than Rhode Island and famed for its dramatic rock formations and the spiky-leafed Joshua trees from which it takes it name, had only a skeleton crew of workers during the shutdown.\\r\\nWith most of its park rangers furloughed, vandals and inconsiderate guests ran amok.

The sensitive ecosystem of desert and craggy rock formations that surrounds them was littered with garbage and other telltale signs of illegal camping.\\r\\nMost visitors to the park were well-behaved, said John Lauretig, a former park ranger who now runs Friends of Joshua Tree, a nonprofit group that organized a small army of volunteers to help clean the park during the shutdown.\\r\\n\u201cIt was just a few vandals or people acting out of ignorance that caused these problems,\u201d he said, reflecting on the broken trees. \u201cHopefully it\u2019s not malice.

Alerted by hospital staff, police officers discovered her on a Birmingham street, having downed a bottle of vodka.\\r\\nThey took her to their station house, waited for her to sober up and called social service agencies and charities for help. Their calls were rebuffed or never answered.\\r\\nAt midnight, Constable Richard Chant finally persuaded the woman to go to a different hospital, but it was a Pyrrhic victory. In the eight hours that officers worked on her case, the West Midlands Police Department received 1,452 other emergency calls, and in many of those cases, hours or days went by before an officer responded.\\r\\n\u201cIt was a bit of checkmate,\u201d Constable Chant said. \u201cWe need to support these people in crisis, but the police are not the right ones to be dealing with them.\u201d\\r\\nConstable Chant\u2019s burden reflects the strained state of policing in Britain\u2019s era of economic austerity: The number and range of emergency calls has risen sharply in Birmingham and in many other cities, but there are now far fewer officers to respond. The economic uncertainties around Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union mean that budget pressures could be far from over.\\r\\nThe West Midlands Police has seen $220 million in budget cuts since the Conservative-led government\u2019s austerity program began in 2010. The department has slashed a quarter of its officers, leaving numbers nearly as low as when the force was formed in 1974. Across England and Wales, police staffing has fallen by about 20,000 officers.\\r\\nThe problem is compounded by parallel cuts to social services. Addiction services, housing benefits, gang mediation programs and social services for both adults and children have all been pared back, creating metastasizing problems that often fall to the police.\\r\\nThere are also questions about whether the cuts are contributing to a spike in violent crime. Murders and robberies, while not near American crime rates, have surged to their highest levels in a decade in England and Wales. Knife offenses rose in 2018 for the fourth straight year, and crimes involving firearms dipped after rising for several years.\\r\\nSince the mid-1990s, Britain has registered a marked decline in violent crime, national crime surveys show, and it is too soon to know if the recent uptick is an anomaly or a trend. But much of the recent debate has focused nonetheless on the impact of austerity \u2014 particularly on how crime calls are going unanswered as officers work to plug holes in the country\u2019s safety net.\\r\\n\u201cIf you\u2019re putting your faith in the police to sort out these problems, you\u2019re really firing a sort of pea shooter at something that\u2019s a cannon-sized problem,\u201d said Richard Garside, the director of the Center for Crime and Justice Studies in London.\\r\\nHours devoted to health and welfare calls leave less time to collect evidence and solve crimes. As a result, victims who are not in immediate danger routinely wait days for a police interview. Officers say they have essentially given up investigating property crimes, dropping burglary complaints unless the homeowners can find a fingerprint or provide surveillance video.\\r\\nPolice spending ballooned in the early 2000s under a Labour government, which gave officers a broad charge to clamp down on small-scale misbehavior and impose order in accordance with the \u201cbroken windows\u201d theory of policing that was then much in vogue. No longer.\\r\\n\u201cIt was all right, the police being the jack-of-all-trades, when there was a necessary amount of funding for the police,\u201d Constable Chant said. \u201cBut if you\u2019ve got 20,000 less police officers, less funding, then somebody needs to make the decision about what they want us to do.\u201d\\r\\nA Tattered Safety Net\\r\\nTwo hours north of London by train, the West Midlands contains former factory towns and cities that were once the industrial heart of England. It is now among the poorest regions in Britain.\\r\\nLast summer, as the West Midlands Police confronted a backlog of more than 2,000 unanswered complaints, the department\u2019s leader, Chief Constable Dave Thompson, went on patrol. One woman had filed a complaint about her brother slashing her tires but was more worried about his mental health than the vandalism.\\r\\n\u201cThey\u2019d tried the doctor and got nothing; they\u2019d tried a community mental health team and they got nothing,\u201d Chief Constable Thompson said. \u201cI can\u2019t solve this for them, but increasingly, we see calls coming through to the police like that because we\u2019re here 24 hours a day.\u201d\\r\\nOn a different afternoon, Inspector Lucy Bird fielded emergency calls in the West Midlands Police dispatch room, her radio crackling with what she called \u201cmispers,\u201d police slang for reports of missing people, many of them mentally ill.\\r\\nOne call involved a mentally ill woman who had stolen lighter fluid and was threatening to burn down a grocery store and set herself on fire. Another call about a man who had gone missing before getting his psychiatric medication set off an intense police search.\\r\\n\u201cA good proportion of our jobs on a daily basis are mental health,\u201d Inspector Bird said.\\r\\nIn recent decades, the rate of diagnoses of severe mental illness has climbed in England while services have been reduced. In turn, officers in England and Wales detained 60 percent more people for psychiatric reasons in 2015-16 than they did a decade earlier. The police in London now receive a call related to mental illness about once every four minutes.\\r\\nPrime Minister Theresa May has said that health care has been protected from austerity cuts. But mental health trusts were given $134 million less to spend on patient care in 2017, accounting for inflation, compared with five years earlier, the Royal College of Psychiatrists reported. And last year, the Care Quality Commission, a health care regulator, concluded that more than a third of mental health trusts in England were rated as needing to improve patient safety.\\r\\nSince the 1980s, tens of thousands of psychiatric beds have been cut, initially as part of a policy shift to caring for the mentally ill in the community rather than in hospitals. Under austerity, those reductions have continued.\\r\\nIn November, a government inspector found that \u201cother organizations rely on the police to effectively \u2018pick up the pieces\u2019 after they have gone off duty.\u201d Even small cuts in social services can mean heavier workloads for police officers.\\r\\nMichael Brown, an inspector in the West Midlands force, is now assigned to study mental health for the national College of Policing. The mental health crisis team in his old patrol area once had two nurses who responded to calls from people who said they were unwell.\\r\\nBy 2014, Inspector Brown said, the team had been halved, and government policy prohibited the nurse who remained from making calls alone for safety reasons.\\r\\nMany of those calls were rerouted to the police.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn Increase in Homicides\\r\\nInside a police station that closed to the public three years ago, Inspector Warren Hines, a homicide detective, was confronted with a resource crisis. There were more than 50 homicides last year in the West Midlands, roughly twice as many as in 2014, yet he has fewer investigators than ever. Robberies or assaults are supposed to get attention within an hour if the offender has left, yet they can go unanswered for days.\\r\\nOn the streets, officers are racing between emergency calls and have less time to patrol a beat. Regular patrols may do little to deter crime, but Inspector Hines said they often provided intelligence essential to his investigations. Officers who used to wait in hot spots for drug dealing or violence now spend more time answering calls.\\r\\n\u201cThere was a time when we\u2019d have a pretty good idea of who would be dealing drugs, we\u2019d have a pretty good idea where a lot of the stolen property was being disposed of,\u201d said Inspector Hines, who is also a representative of West Midlands Police Federation, which advocates for officers. \u201cAnd now we just don\u2019t know.\u201d\\r\\nAt the end of May, Inspector Hines was canvassing for witnesses to the killing of a 15-year-old boy. He came upon a taxi driver who, if not likely to be a crucial witness, still could have helped describe the scene. But the man declined to help, saying the police had failed to help him after he reported three robberies.\\r\\n\u201cHe said, \u2018I don\u2019t really see it\u2019s my job to help you,\u2019\u201d Inspector Hines said.\\r\\nPart of what has slowed response times has been the closing of local police stations and the consolidation of response teams that began in the early years of austerity. Only 10 stations in the West Midlands now have a public counter, down from 48 in 2010, and 14 local stations have been shut completely.\\r\\nSgt. Richard Cooke, the chairman of the West Midlands Police Federation, remembered an assault case in Walsall, an industrial town northwest of Birmingham. A woman called the emergency number to say that her son, who had a history of drug abuse, was trying to kick in her door.\\r\\nThe nearest officers were in Wolverhampton, about 10 miles away. By the time they arrived, the woman had been attacked and her son had fled.\\r\\n\u201cThat\u2019s happening on a regular basis,\u201d Sergeant Cooke said.\\r\\n\u2018Their Gang Is Bigger Than Our Gang\u2019\\r\\nFor many police departments, as well as for Britain\u2019s still influential tabloids, the answer to the deteriorating service seems simple: more officers. Patterns of taxi robberies and home break-ins are being missed because so many cases are shelved without so much as a cursory investigation, they say. Victims stop calling the police. Criminals are emboldened.\\r\\n\u201cWhen the criminals realize that their gang is bigger than our gang,\u201d Constable Chant said, \u201cthey start exploiting that.\u201d\\r\\nMuch of the blame has fallen on Mrs. May, the architect of the cuts as home secretary from 2010 to 2016. Even as she negotiates Britain\u2019s tortured withdrawal from the European Union, she faces the daily ire of officers who have not forgiven her for past crackdowns on corruption in officer associations and on stop-and-frisk tactics, or for the personnel cutbacks.\\r\\n\u201cWe think she\u2019s got it in for us,\u201d Sergeant Cooke said.\\r\\nBut others say Britain should restore funding for social services rather than expand police forces that are poorly equipped to address a mental health crisis.\\r\\nIn mid-December, Mrs. May\u2019s government announced an additional $1.2 billion for the police. Police leaders were quick to lament that much of it would be absorbed by the forces\u2019 growing pension obligations, rather than adding more officers.\\r\\nKirk Dawes, a former West Midlands police officer, retired from the force and started a mediation program for Birmingham, the site of vicious feuds between gangs like the Burger Bar Boys and Johnson Crew.\\r\\nHaving studied gang mediation tactics in New Jersey and in Northern Ireland, he took referrals from the police when someone was attacked or when investigators caught wind of a threat to someone\u2019s life.\\r\\nWith roughly 100 cases a year in the early 2000s, the mediation team had only one person killed on its watch. The team had an annual budget of roughly $440,000, and Mr. Dawes figures it saved the government millions of dollars in costly homicide investigations. But under austerity, the program\u2019s budget was sharply reduced, until it folded in 2012.\\r\\nBy last fall, more than a third of the homicides being investigated by West Midlands detectives were the sort of killings that Mr. Dawes\u2019s team might once have worked to prevent.\\r\\n\u201cAll of that was lost,\u201d he said.\\r\\n\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":288498403,\"description\":\"Police forces in Britain are shrinking, as are social services.

Apple reported on Tuesday that its revenue was down in part because consumers are buying new phones less frequently, and the chipmakers NVIDIA and Intel both indicated weakening demand for the components they build for data centers.\\r\\nBut on Wednesday, Microsoft showed solid performance across its commercial and consumer businesses, reporting revenue of almost $32.5 billion in the last quarter, and a profit of almost $8.6 billion, both increases of more than 10 percent over the same period a year ago.\\r\\nMicrosoft had handily beat analyst expectations recently. In the last quarter, the results fell mostly in line with what investors expected, and shares fell about 2.5 percent in aftermarket trading, wiping out most of the gains made earlier in the day.\\r\\nThe company continued its shift to cloud computing, which allows businesses to store and analyze their data in remote centers. Its offering is now widely seen as the strong No. 2 in the market that had once been dominated only by Amazon.\\r\\nSatya Nadella, the company\u2019s chief executive, said in a call with investors that Microsoft was not seeing a slowing in demand. \u201cIt\u2019s very healthy and will continue to be healthy.\u201d\\r\\nThe company\u2019s consumer products also did well during the holiday season, with a 39 percent increase in sales of Surface tablets and laptops compared with the same quarter in 2017. Sales of its high-margin Windows operating system fell, which the company tied to a continuing shortage in computer chips.\\r\\nThe last quarter illustrated Microsoft\u2019s increasing strength. At times, it surpassed Apple and Amazon to become the most valuable company in the world, which was both a sign of its resurgence and the stumbles faced by its peers. The company announced a series of major, multiyear partnerships with large customers that validate a bet by Mr. Nadella to shift the company\u2019s focus to cloud computing and away from personal computers.\\r\\nA few months ago, Microsoft indicated that its rapid global expansion of data centers would moderate this year, but it signaled this was more about making the best use of all its capacity rather than a sign that customers were less interested in cloud-based services.\\r\\n\u201cWe think this is cyclicality \u2014 you build then you grow, you build then you grow,\u201d said Jennifer Lowe, an analyst who covers the company for UBS.\\r\\nSales for Azure, Microsoft\u2019s core cloud computing offering, were up 76 percent over the same period last year, the same pace as last quarter. This is a slower growth rate than 2017 and the first half of 2018, but analysts say that mostly reflects how big the business has gotten.\\r\\n\u201cAzure outperformed, so fears of a deceleration in that business are misplaced,\u201d said Brad Reback, an analyst at Stifel.\\r\\nAnd Microsoft\u2019s overall commercial cloud computing revenue, which includes both Azure and subscriptions to cloud-based Office 365, grew 48 percent, to $9 billion.\\r\\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t just changed the product set \u2014 they have literally changed the culture, and they are really acting like a cloud platform,\u201d Mr. Reback said. He added that Microsoft uses the constant flow of data passing though its cloud computing services to develop and improve its products and sales more quickly.\\r\\nMicrosoft has found success in offering a so-called hybrid cloud offering, in which customers keep some data on their own servers and others in the cloud and manage it all with a single set of tools. Analysts say the company has an advantage over Amazon in that area, because so many large business already use Microsoft tools on their servers.\\r\\nAmy Hood, Microsoft\u2019s chief financial officer, pointed to 24 percent growth in server products and cloud services revenue as an indicator of strength in that business. She said that figure includes pure Azure sales as well as premium traditional server sales that can be managed together. \u201cThat gives customers flexibility to decide when to move,\u201d she said.\\r\\nSome customers adopt Azure just for basic cloud computing, but Microsoft is looking for ways to bring technology deeper into how businesses operate, what Mr. Nadella has called embracing \u201ctech intensity.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cThe opportunity for our shareholders when they think about Microsoft has never been better,\u201d Mr. Nadella said in a call with analysts. He said Microsoft\u2019s interests align with those of its customers, because the company\u2019s cloud products often bring in revenue from subscriptions and use rather than large upfront costs. \u201cWe want to make sure we are in fact making our customers fully capable digital customers in their own right,\u201d he said.\\r\\nMicrosoft and Kroger are working to develop cloud-connected physical retail stores, with new products like digital price tags and sensors to track shoppers and show them customized ads. Another partnership, with Walgreens Boots Alliance in the pharmacy sphere, aims to use artificial intelligence to improve health care outcomes.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just how to get you to buy Windows,\u201d Ms. Lowe said. \u201cTechnology is going to get deeper into the guts of how companies operate.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":254470884,\"description\":\"The company reported revenue of $32.5 billion in the last quarter, and it made a profit of almost $8.6 billion, big increases over the same period a year ago.\\r\",\"title\":\"Releasing Earnings, Microsoft Stays in Stride, With Cloud Powering the Way\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"technology.16.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Last September, a group of academics and activists gathered at Princeton University to discuss the limits of artificial intelligence in public policy.\\r\\nThe longest debate concerned some of the most sensitive decisions in the justice system, like whether to release a person on bail or parole. Many in attendance were queasy about using algorithms to determine prison stays \u2014 not least because crime data tends to reflect racial bias. But one conferencegoer in particular stood out for his skepticism.\\r\\nHis name was Bruce Reilly. The deputy director of a New Orleans organization called VOTE, which advocates for the formerly incarcerated, Mr. Reilly is a minor celebrity in the field. He was a sounding board for the leader of the recent Florida ballot campaign that restored voting rights to up to 1.4 million former felons, and helped lead similar initiatives in Rhode Island and Louisiana.\\r\\nMr. Reilly, 45, has playful eyes, weathered skin and a boyish voice, and at Princeton, he wore a dark blazer that did not appear to be his natural uniform. Though it was barely midmorning, his shirt was already threatening to decamp from his pants as he turned to address a Princeton postdoctoral student sitting next to him.\\r\\n\u201cStatistically,\u201d Mr. Reilly told her, \u201cthe safest person to let out of prison is a murderer.\u201d The academic, Madelyn Sanfilippo, screwed up her face in apparent disbelief.\\r\\n\u201cYou seem like a person who cares about statistics,\u201d Mr. Reilly continued, arguing that people convicted of lesser crimes often cycle in and out of prison, while someone serving a long sentence for murder has typically matured out of crime by the time he is released.\\r\\n\u201cThat makes sense,\u201d Ms. Sanfilippo said, warming to the claim.\\r\\nThey talked amiably for a few more minutes. When they were done, Mr. Reilly turned and whispered in my ear: \u201cShe has no idea.\u201d\\r\\n\u2018You need to be broken\u2019\\r\\nIn September 1992, a Rhode Island community college professor named Charles Russell picked up a 19-year-old hitchhiker on an interstate. The two men eventually made it to Mr. Russell\u2019s home, where they smoked marijuana and talked books for hours.\\r\\nAbout a week later, the hitchhiker returned. The two men talked and smoked again. But as Mr. Russell performed oral sex on him, the younger man became enraged. He picked up a knife and began stabbing at Mr. Russell\u2019s neck.\\r\\nMr. Russell tried to defend himself with a fireplace poker, but the man wrested it from his hand and beat him until he stopped moving. As the younger man was dressing, Mr. Russell rose to his feet, picked up a small statue and charged. The man took the statue away and delivered several more blows, fatally crushing Mr. Russell\u2019s skull.\\r\\nA year later, acting on a tip, the police arrested Bruce Reilly. He confessed that he had snapped during the sexual encounter, and that the fight had escalated once Mr. Russell fought back.\\r\\n\u201cI was reacting \u2014 I had stuff built up inside of me,\u201d Mr. Reilly told me. Facing life in prison, he accepted a deal to plead guilty to second-degree murder, and a judge sentenced him to 20 years, followed by 25 years of probation.\\r\\nMany of Mr. Reilly\u2019s high school friends were shocked, if not entirely surprised. He had always been precocious, but his home life was a mess \u2014 his mother was in and out of psychiatric institutions, and he lived in foster care for years as a young child. As a teenager, he dealt drugs and stole license plates. He was accepted to college but didn\u2019t fill out the paperwork in time to qualify for financial aid. He was constantly hustling from one dead-end gig or sketchy apartment to another, until one night he ended up at the home of the man he would kill.\\r\\nIn prison, Mr. Reilly became something of an ascetic. He read and wrote for hours each day and strictly limited his TV intake. He accumulated a small circle of friends who believed he had special insight into surviving incarceration. They would write essays on a chosen topic, like whether democracy was the best form of government, and circulate them for feedback.\\r\\nWhen they debated prison reform, their views were a mix of Old Testament justice and New. They came to believe that their dreary sentences were central to their rehabilitation.\\r\\n\u201cYou need to be broken,\u201d Greg Tovmasian, a member of the group, told me. \u201cYou need to be completely honest with yourself about why you\u2019re in there. If you\u2019re constantly on the phone, talking to people out there, your head is still in society.\u201d The flip side, they believed, was that if a person had done his grappling and come through it, there ceased to be a point to keeping him locked up.\\r\\nMr. Reilly was often the most effective legal adviser his fellow inmates ever consulted. He spent hundreds of hours studying case law in the prison library and wrote dozens of petitions, briefs and motions. He helped at least two fellow prisoners reduce their sentences by several years. \u201cIt was like magic to people \u2014 like mixing chemicals,\u201d said his friend Steven Parkhurst, who is still in prison.\\r\\nMr. Reilly was paroled in 2005. He enrolled at Rhode Island College, worked low-wage jobs and became active in a local civil rights group that\u2019s now known as OpenDoors. The organization was campaigning for a ballot initiative to restore the voting rights of felons after their release, and Mr. Reilly eventually worked as a strategist and volunteer coordinator for the effort, which passed.\\r\\nTo help continue his work on behalf of the formerly incarcerated, Mr. Reilly applied to law school. Although he scored in the top 7 percent on the standardized entrance exam, he didn\u2019t have a bachelor\u2019s degree, and only one of more than two dozen schools accepted him. In the fall of 2011, Mr. Reilly arrived on the campus of Tulane University \u2014 and almost immediately confronted the question that still dogs him today.\\r\\nThe purest test of mainstreaming\\r\\nThe political consensus for bringing former convicts back into society\u2019s mainstream has shifted faster this decade than at any other moment in modern history. Late last year, President Trump signed into law a watershed bill reducing prison sentences for a range of federal offenders, with backing from a coalition that ranged from the American Civil Liberties Union to the Koch brothers. Numerous cities and states have enacted \u201cban the box\u201d laws, preventing employers from asking about criminal history on a job application. The Florida initiative whose leader Mr. Reilly counseled passed by a nearly two-to-one ratio.\\r\\nBut many of these recent gains have accrued to nonviolent offenders. What about rehabilitation for those who have committed a brutal crime?\\r\\n\u201cWe as a culture have yet to confront forgiveness for someone who commits a crime that we universally agree\u201d is abhorrent, Mr. Reilly once told me, using an expletive. \u201cThe drug offender \u2014 that person should not even be in jail,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe hard questions are reintegration for people the criminal justice system was actually designed for.\u201d People like him.\\r\\nSince I started tracking his career, in 2013, I\u2019ve come to think of Mr. Reilly, whom prosecutors once described as a manipulative \u201cpredator,\u201d as the purest test of America\u2019s commitment to mainstreaming ex-felons. Even as Mr. Reilly makes it his life\u2019s work to advance the cause, he finds himself illustrating its limits. That\u2019s both because his crime was so severe and because he is not satisfied merely to be housed or employed. He craves elite credentials and recognition, like advanced degrees and fellowships, and wants to work on cutting-edge legal issues.\\r\\nLast summer, I attended a Soros Justice Fellowships conference in New Orleans with Mr. Reilly, who had been invited to appear on a panel about solitary confinement. Funded by the liberal billionaire George Soros, the organization behind the conference is one of the country\u2019s largest financial backers of criminal justice reform.\\r\\nAs he collected his name tag from a table, Mr. Reilly glanced down at the other names and began identifying who had won various fellowships, grants and accolades. \u201cI\u2019ve applied to them all, have not gotten any of them,\u201d he said. And then, referring to his efforts in Louisiana and Rhode Island, he added with a degree of pride: \u201cBut apparently you don\u2019t need a fellowship to win voting rights.\u201d\\r\\nWhen Mr. Reilly got to Tulane Law School in 2011, he initially fell in with a circle of students interested in civil rights and unfazed by his past. \u201cHe straight-up told me he had been convicted of murder,\u201d one classmate, Allyson Page, recalled. \u201cI was like, \u2018O.K., that\u2019s cool.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t expecting that, but I didn\u2019t care that much.\u201d\\r\\nBut within a few weeks, another student began to broadcast Mr. Reilly\u2019s criminal record across campus. Some classmates complained that his presence compromised their safety and would make it harder for them to land jobs.\\r\\nThe story \u2014 ex-murderer at exclusive law school! \u2014 was picked up by the popular legal blog Above the Law. An unnamed student wondered if, \u201cwhen placed in one of the most stress-inducing environments in the United States, Mr. Reilly will reach his tipping point and live up to his violent past.\u201d Another espoused a form of Nimby-ism: \u201cI think felons should get a second chance. But why at Tulane? What are we, the law school for murderers?\u201d\\r\\nTV crews turned up near his house. A producer for \u201cDr. Phil\u201d called Mr. Reilly on his cellphone; a reporter from \u201cInside Edition\u201d staked out his apartment.\\r\\nPublicly, David Meyer, the law\u2019s school\u2019s dean, was statesmanlike. Tulane\u2019s admissions process \u201callows for the possibility of redemption even in exceptional circumstances of tragedy and hardship,\u201d he told Above the Law. But privately, Mr. Meyer seemed as panicked as anyone. Susan Krinsky, the dean of admissions, said in an interview that Mr. Meyer had told her, \u201cYou have endangered this entire community.\u201d (Ms. Krinsky left Tulane about a year later, and Mr. Meyer declined to comment.)\\r\\nMr. Reilly, fearing Tulane would revoke his admission, tried to lie low. But he soon realized he had to stop his classmates from getting their information secondhand, off the internet. And he tried to convince his peers, one at a time, that he belonged.\\r\\n\u201cBruce was in the hallway \u2014 he was friends with people who were conservative, people who were liberals,\u201d recalled Tony Viviani, a close friend. \u201cOne of the most staunch conservative guys was an Alabama grad. He was talking football with him, smacking right back.\u201d\\r\\nTwo years later, when I was in New Orleans to give a talk, I arranged to meet Mr. Reilly for coffee. I was fascinated by how someone could live in two completely different worlds, one familiar to me, the other unimaginable. But as the appointment got closer, I started to worry. I had a daughter, a wife. Was it really such a good idea to schmooze with a murderer?\\r\\nWhen we did meet, we chatted for nearly an hour about writing and fatherhood. (Mr. Reilly has a daughter from a relationship in Rhode Island.) He was humble and thoughtful, and I was immediately embarrassed by the vague scenarios I had played out in my head.\\r\\nStill, to this day, I sometimes struggle to shake my mental image of his crime. And I can\u2019t help thinking: If Mr. Reilly worked at, say, a top-shelf law firm, how many partners would claim the office next to his? Bunk with him on a corporate retreat? Introduce him to their spouse and children?\\r\\nAlthough Mr. Reilly apologized to the Russell family at his sentencing hearing in 1996, it takes only a little probing to affirm how fresh his crime remains. His victim\u2019s sister-in-law, Marilyn Rodriguez, told me that she and her two children had been especially close to Mr. Russell, and that his death had \u201cmade a mess of our whole family.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cThe hurt is still in our family,\u201d she added. \u201cIt can\u2019t be undone.\u201d\\r\\nConfined by his past\\r\\nMr. Reilly, who graduated from Tulane in 2014, would like to be able to practice law, but it\u2019s highly unlikely that he could pass the \u201ccharacter and fitness\u201d portion of the bar admissions process. He\u2019s interested in data and internet privacy issues, but he\u2019s hard-pressed to get a foothold in such fields.\\r\\nAfter getting his law degree, Mr. Reilly searched unsuccessfully for a position that would suit his qualifications: policy jobs in Washington, entertainment-law gigs in Los Angeles, even a job with the Tribeca Film Institute in New York. He landed only two interviews and struggled to discuss his criminal record with prospective employers.\\r\\n\u201cOnce you let the debate go there,\u201d Mr. Reilly said, \u201cnow they\u2019re visualizing you killing someone.\u201d\\r\\nFinally, after nearly six months piling credit card debt on top of his student loans, he landed a job in New Orleans as a paralegal at the Capital Appeals Project, which represents indigent people on death row. From there he moved to another criminal justice reform organization and eventually to VOTE.\\r\\nLast summer, Mr. Reilly was part of a small team of activists that met with Roger Goodell, the commissioner of the National Football League, and executives for the New Orleans Saints. He briefly told his story, explaining how he was an impulsive teenager before committing his crime, but came out of prison an adult. He made a plea for the Saints and the league to throw their weight behind initiatives that would ease assimilation. The executives nodded sympathetically.\\r\\nMr. Reilly makes a quick impression with his intellect. When he was a law student, for example, it took him only a few hours of research to conclude that Louisiana\u2019s ban on voting by felons on probation or parole probably violated the state\u2019s Constitution, and a large group of legal scholars agreed. Still, the fact that Mr. Reilly has devoted his professional life to the rights of the formerly incarcerated \u2014 as opposed to a less personal issue like genetically modified foods, another law school interest \u2014 testifies to the way his past confines him.\\r\\nIn some ways, he confines himself. Mr. Reilly has a habit of leaning into stereotypes about felons, almost as a political protest, and I sometimes wonder if it is self-defeating. The T-shirts he favors do little to conceal his tattoos, and he leans heavily on jailhouse idiom when he speaks. There are frequent allusions to \u201cbids\u201d (tours in prison), \u201cguys in the yard\u201d (fellow prisoners) and \u201cshankings\u201d (stabbings with a makeshift weapon).\\r\\nRace also complicates his upward trajectory in an uncomfortable way. After Mr. Reilly introduced me as a journalist to fellow reformers at the Soros conference, some responded with a measure of irritation: Criminal justice issues disproportionately affect minorities, and I was going to profile a white guy? From Rhode Island? Who went to a fancy law school?\\r\\nMr. Reilly is the first to concede the advantages he has over former inmates who are black or Latino. \u201cI can go incognito as a white guy,\u201d he said. But he is still pained by the skepticism his race sometimes provokes among progressives.\\r\\nThen there is the continuing threat to his freedom, in which even a seemingly minor political dispute can escalate into a crisis.\\r\\nIn December, a judicial oversight committee in New Orleans ruled that a candidate for a local judgeship had made false statements about Mr. Reilly\u2019s employer, VOTE. On the day of the ruling, the candidate, Marie Williams, applied for a temporary restraining order against Mr. Reilly, saying he had harassed her through social media, filed baseless claims against her and endorsed her opponent.\\r\\nThe temporary order was granted \u2014 Louisiana has a low threshold for such actions \u2014 and a judge deemed Mr. Reilly in violation of the order when his lawyer reached out to Ms. Williams to request that she withdraw it. Now a pending warrant for his arrest could send him to jail. Mr. Reilly\u2019s lawyer hopes to resolve the matter this month, when a court will consider the case.\\r\\nThe sheer hysteria of a murder conviction\\r\\nMr. Reilly is encouraged by the growing number of formerly incarcerated people who have gained entree into elite professions and rarefied social strata. He cites with pride his friend Andres Idarraga, who spent time in prison for selling drugs and later earned a law degree from Yale and worked for the famed law firm Boies Schiller Flexner; and Reginald Dwayne Betts, an acclaimed poet who graduated from Yale Law after serving time for a carjacking. Neither of them, though, has a murder conviction.\\r\\nA vanishingly small number of such people have even begun to claw their way toward mainstream respectability after serving their sentences. Michelle Jones, who published original historical research while serving more than 20 years for the murder of her young son, lost out on a place in a Harvard Ph.D. program when the school overruled its own history department. (She gained admission to New York University.)\\r\\nMr. Reilly\u2019s prison friend Greg Tovmasian, who was convicted of second-degree murder, abandoned his application to the University of Rhode Island when he was told that he would have to meet with a university official to be considered. \u201cI just wasn\u2019t ready emotionally to face another parole board,\u201d Mr. Tovmasian said. Instead he earned an economics degree at the smaller Rhode Island College.\\r\\nMr. Reilly believes that by telling his story, he can help diminish the sheer hysteria a murder conviction can inspire. But while he has been granted more audiences from the likes of Princeton and the New Orleans Saints, Mr. Reilly has not found that organizations outside the criminal justice field are rushing to work alongside him, in close quarters, for sustained periods. They see him as a source of information or a helpful perspective, but rarely as a potential colleague or friend.\\r\\nAt the Princeton A.I. conference, Mr. Reilly had a long and seemingly productive conversation about life after prison with a man named Chuck Howell, who had an impressive job at a company that manages federal research and development centers. But later, as the two men bantered about police departments and the issue of disciplining rogue cops, Mr. Reilly spun out an extended prison metaphor.\\r\\nIf a gang member wrongs an inmate from a different gang, he said, leaders from the offender\u2019s group will typically agree to punish him on their own. From where I stood, Mr. Howell, who had seemed engaged and receptive at the beginning of the exchange, started to look uncomfortable.\\r\\n\u201cThe problem with the cops is they don\u2019t do it,\u201d Mr. Reilly continued, meaning that police departments don\u2019t rein in rogue officers. \u201cIf you were a real gang, you\u2019d off that guy.

But with Russia asserting it is complying, the outlook for preserving the treaty, regarded as one of the most important in the history of preventing nuclear war, is bleak.\\r\\nHere is a look at the origins of the accord, known as the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, and the possible impact of its demise.\\r\\nWhat is the I.N.F. Treaty and how did it come about?\\r\\nThe treaty resolved a crisis of the 1980s when the Soviet Union deployed a missile in Europe called the SS-20, capable of carrying three nuclear warheads. The United States responded with cruise and Pershing II missiles based in Europe.\\r\\nBy the time President Ronald Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader at the time, negotiated the deal to ban the weapons in 1987, the intermediate-range missiles had come to be seen as a hair trigger for nuclear war because of their short flight times \u2014 as little as 10 minutes.\\r\\nThis was particularly troubling to the Soviet command, which could be destroyed by a \u201cbolt from the blue\u201d strike before it could order a retaliatory attack. Partly in response to this shortcoming, Moscow developed a \u201cdead hand\u201d trigger to fire its arsenal at the United States without an order from the leadership, based on computers interpreting radiation and seismic sensors.\\r\\nThe treaty prohibited land-based cruise or ballistic missiles with ranges between 311 miles and 3,420 miles. It did not cover air- or sea-launched weapons, such as the American Tomahawk and Russian Kalibr cruise missiles fired from ships, submarines or airplanes, although those missiles fly similar distances.\\r\\n\\r\\nWas Russia actually in breach of the treaty terms?\\r\\nAccording to information dating to the Obama administration, it seems so. During the 2014 crisis in Ukraine, the United States accused Russia of violating the treaty by deploying prohibited tactical nuclear weapons designed to intimidate Europe and the former Soviet states that have aligned with the West.\\r\\nPresident Barack Obama personally informed President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in a letter that the United States believed the Russians were violating the treaty, but that he wanted to resolve the issue through dialogue and preserve the accord.\\r\\nThe Russians have said there is no violation. But American officials say Moscow is all but openly deploying a prohibited missile that the West calls the SSC-8, a land-based cruise missile that could be threatening to European nations.\\r\\nLast month, Russian officials put a newly modified version of that missile on display for a foreign audience for the first time in an attempt to rebut the accusations that the weapon violates the treaty.\\r\\nThe display was intended to underscore Russia\u2019s \u201cincreased transparency and our adherence to the I.N.F. Treaty,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Mikhail Matveyevskiy, the chief of missiles and artillery for the Russian armed forces, and to show off new modifications.\\r\\nTrump administration officials, who first signaled last year that they would withdraw the United States from the treaty, said the display was meaningless in allaying their concerns.\\r\\nIs China obliged to honor the I.N.F. Treaty?\\r\\nNo, and it may be a greater concern to the Trump administration than Russia.\\r\\nWhile the Chinese military is carving out a greater sphere of influence in the Western Pacific, the I.N.F. Treaty constrains the United States from placing short- and intermediate-range missiles on land near China as a deterrent.\\r\\nFor this and other reasons, Mr. Trump and his national security adviser, John R. Bolton, have called the I.N.F. Treaty outdated.\\r\\nWhat comes next for Europe?\\r\\nEuropean leaders have been among the most vocal protesters of the treaty withdrawal. While they agree with the United States that Russia\u2019s new intermediate range missiles threaten Europe, they say the answer is to renegotiate the accord, not scrap it.\\r\\n\u201cDeeply concerned by the state of nuclear arms control after U.S. announcement to suspend the I.N.F.,\u201d Margot Wallstrom, Sweden\u2019s minister for foreign affairs, said in a statement tweeted on Friday after the announcement. \u201cFundamental cause is Russia\u2019s noncompliance. Trend of less cooperation on disarmament must be reversed and new ways forward explored.\u201d\\r\\nFederica Mogherini, the European Union\u2019s top diplomat, speaking during a meeting of European Union defense ministers in Bucharest, Romania, this week said that Europe had benefited enormously from the treaty. \u201cWe continue to hope that there is a way to maintain it and to fully implement it,\u201d she said.\\r\\nEurope could have good reason to fear the impact of the treaty\u2019s collapse. Russia, perhaps seeking to stoke European anxieties, has emphasized the risks of a nuclear missile buildup.\\r\\nThe chairman of the Russian Senate\u2019s foreign affairs committee, Konstantin Kosachyov, said the withdrawal was a victory for \u201cWashington\u2019s hawks led by John Bolton\u201d that would come at a direct cost for European security.\\r\\nVladimir Shamanov, head of the defense committee in Russia\u2019s Parliament, also had ominous words for Europe: \u201cWe will have to adjust our plans on the use of all arms and branches of the military and, naturally, Europe will find itself in a sticky situation.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHow is Russia expected to respond?\\r\\nBefore the United States moved to withdraw from the treaty, Mr. Putin and Russia\u2019s generals had suggested they didn\u2019t have to respond with new deployments, as their current armaments were already enough to guarantee nuclear apocalypse for the United States.\\r\\nIn a speech to the Defense Ministry late last year, Mr. Putin suggested Russia would respond by quickly deploying missiles now banned by the treaty \u2014 something the United States says Russia has, in fact, already done.\\r\\nOn Friday, a former director of the Russian general staff, Gen. Viktor Yesin, suggested Russia will respond in kind if the United States deploys short-range missiles in Europe, but may not if the Americans limit deployments to the Pacific region.\\r\\n\u201cIt would not be difficult\u201d for Russia to make new short-range missiles, he told the Interfax news agency. \u201cIf they deploy missiles to Europe, the tensions, of course, will seriously increase.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-96237933,\"description\":\"The United States is withdrawing from a landmark arms-control pact with Russia.

An information technology specialist for Sharp HealthCare in San Diego, she began searching for another position (while trying to get pregnant), and checking out the benefits of Sharp\u2019s competitors (while also trying to get pregnant). \\r\\nThe last time she had been on the job market, Ms. Burns said, \u201cI wanted the ability to work remotely, and of course I wanted the biggest paycheck I could get.\u201d Now she had a different priority: fertility coverage.\\r\\nMs. Burns had prepared well for a baby, even moving to a master-planned community in San Marcos, Calif. \u201cWe moved to this neighborhood specifically for the great schools and the extra bedrooms to put the kids in,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s completely suburbia.\u201d \\r\\nBut as time ticked by without a bundle of occasionally shrieking joy tucked into one of those extra bedrooms, she felt discouraged. She cut out caffeine, took long walks with her rescue dog, Blu, and focused on reducing her stress, which was hard to do because the main reason she was stressed was that she couldn\u2019t get pregnant.\\r\\nThe way this story, euphemistically called a \u201cfertility journey,\u201d usually goes is that Ms. Burns would dig into her savings in pursuit of her goal. Conceiving the unnatural way has never been more widespread, with around one in 65 babies in America born after fertility treatments. Michelle Obama recently revealed that neither Sasha nor Malia came into this life after just a romantic date with Barack.\\r\\nBut in 2019, perhaps surprisingly given the general attenuation of benefits like vacations and pensions to the American worker, more employees at the country\u2019s largest and most prominent companies are finding that their companies\u2019 health care plans include fertility coverage. \\r\\nThe slow but rising trend can be credited to a combination of fading taboos around difficulty conceiving; a competitive job market with employers eager to adopt recruiting and retention tools; and the reframing of infertility as an issue less about ambitious women who have waited too long than one of corporate diversity and inclusion. The rising power in the workplace of women in their 30s, many of whom take responsibility for building a family, cannot be discounted.\\r\\nEmployer insurance covering some fertility treatment has been around for a while. But in the past, companies have resisted including coverage for in vitro fertilization, the gold-standard treatment and one of the most expensive. Prices begin at $12,000 for merely one try at a \u201clive birth,\u201d in the unnervingly pragmatic parlance of doctors.\\r\\nMercer, a benefits consulting firm, analyzed big employers (that\u2019s 20,000 workers and up) and found that 44 percent offered some sort of I.V.F. benefit in 2018, compared with 37 percent in 2017. \\r\\nSmaller companies showed less of an increase, and benefits for egg freezing \u2014 the treatment that helps women put their eggs on ice, regardless if they have sperm available right now \u2014 are far lower. Some states, like Massachusetts, require insurers to offer I.V.F. coverage. \\r\\nThe federal government hasn\u2019t taken up this mantle, and given its current chaotic state, you would have to be on a lot more medication than the procedure requires to seriously consider that to be a possibility. Perhaps it will happen in the coming decades, with the United States birthrate falling to a record low last year.\\r\\nThese days, I.V.F. coverage is \u201cescaping\u201d the sectors that have traditionally offered it, meaning tech, banking and media, said Jake Anderson, a former partner at Sequoia Capital and a founder of Fertility IQ, a website that assesses doctors, procedures and clinics. General Mills, Chobani, the Cooper Companies and Designer Shoe Warehouse have either introduced coverage or greatly increased dollar amounts for 2019. Procter & Gamble Company offered only $5,000 in fertility benefits until this year, when it increased the benefit to $40,000.\\r\\nIn some cases these shifts happened after women lobbied the C-suite for increased coverage, though other women struggling with infertility are uncomfortable telling employers about impending pregnancies, fearing they may be penalized for the leave they will require. \\r\\nIt\u2019s hard to believe corporate communications departments aren\u2019t burning up the airwaves with this information, but very few news releases about robust fertility coverage have been issued. Some companies listed on a survey of patients conducted by Fertility IQ did not respond to requests to confirm benefit information, though those other big names were happy to discuss plans. \\r\\n\u201cYou\u2019d imagine in a #MeToo world where people are falling all over themselves to present themselves as family friendly, female friendly, that they would shout from the rooftops that they were offering this benefit,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a more generous benefit than to help somebody build a family when they can\u2019t do it, and at these dollar amounts.\u201d \\r\\nMr. Anderson also noted that some companies are not publicizing the benefit well enough internally, to their own employees.\\r\\nSome corporate silence may exist to discourage what some employees have started doing: fertility shopping. Though these benefits could help employers recruit the best candidates in a tight job market, the price tag could be high if lots of employees actually, you know, use the benefits. After all, while I.V.F. prices start at $12,000 a cycle, many patients pay closer to $20,000. And with \u201clive births\u201d often requiring two or more cycles to conceive, the bill can be $40,000 and up. \\r\\nKristi King, 38, the director of marketing sciences at Penn Schoen Berland, a marketing research and consulting firm in Denver, had $10,000 in fertility benefits through the company \u2014 generous, to be sure, but not enough to cover the five I.V.F. cycles she has undergone. \\r\\nMs. King estimated that she and her husband have paid about $50,000 out of pocket for treatment. She said she sold a condo, refinanced her home and is always on the lookout for what she calls \u201csky money,\u201d like a rebate. \u201cIt\u2019s been stop and save, stop and save,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to spend a year between treatments trying to get the finances to keep going.\u201d\\r\\nSo far as she knew, the only way to get more money for her quest was to work as a part-time barista at Starbucks. It was something she had read about online, where the topic is discussed in clicky articles like \u201cI Took a Job at Starbucks to Get Infertility Benefits\u201d and infertility forums like \u201cMatt and Doree\u2019s Eggcellent Adventure,\u201d a Facebook group founded by Doree Shafrir, a podcaster and writer, and her partner, Matt Mira. \\r\\nFor years, Starbucks was among the most prominent of large companies when it came to fertility coverage. It offered benefits to even low-level contract employees, so any given person making Frappuccinos may receive $15,000 in I.V.F. benefits \u2014 plus medication \u2014 kicking in after a month of employment. (Howard Schultz for president?)\\r\\nMs. King was talking on her cellphone while at Lowe\u2019s shopping for racks for her garage to store her Christmas ornaments. She described switching doctors, traveling out of the country for treatment, and the way optimism turned to frustration and pain. Her voice began to tremble. \\r\\n\u201cThis should be covered like any other medical condition, to your maximum benefit amount, just like if I get cancer,\u201d she said. For her, \u201cthe financial piece made the emotional piece exponentially harder. There\u2019s so much on the line, in addition to your heart being on the line.\u201d\\r\\nNo matter how much money is put toward treatment, there are no guarantees. \u201cI.V.F. can be fantastic and miraculous, but it can also become a frenzy,\u201d said Tamara Jenkins, the director of \u201cPrivate Life,\u201d a 2018 film that stars Paul Giamatti and Kathryn Hahn as a couple in the creative class who lose grip of rational thought and blow through their savings in the mad pursuit of a child. \\r\\nMs. Jenkins, a former patient herself, said that experience with fertility treatments was wide-ranging among her crew, including a member of the prop team, who brought a heap of her old paperwork and infertility gear for shoots.\\r\\n\u201cThere\u2019s something dangling in front of you and you keep pursuing it, and it can make people insane,\u201d Ms. Jenkins said. \u201cPeople\u2019s expectations have to be real.\u201d\\r\\nEmployers also don\u2019t match expectations equally. At some companies, both heterosexual and same-sex couples, as well as singles, can access benefits. But at others, coverage isn\u2019t triggered until an employee has had unprotected sex of the baby-making kind for six or 12 months. \\r\\nEmma, 38, a social worker who asked that her last name be withheld for privacy, said she took out a personal loan of tens of thousands of dollars to pay for her treatment. She was unable to get access to her fertility coverage through her employer even though she had a diagnosis of diminished ovarian reserve (otherwise known as \u201cnot enough good eggs\u201d). \\r\\n\u201cI am queer and do not currently have sex with men,\u201d she wrote in a Facebook message, but nevertheless her employer\u2019s insurance required her to \u201ctry \u2018naturally\u2019 for 12 months before they would cover anything.\u201d\\r\\nEmployers could be helpful with this problem, if they choose to be. Morgan Stanley has rolled out an extended family plan for 2019 to cover treatments without any diagnosis requirements, making trying for a baby easier for employees who are single or in same-sex relationships; the company covers assisted reproductive technology to a lifetime maximum of $30,000.\\r\\nProgyny, a fertility benefits manager, is also streamlining fertility treatment and removing hurdles like the \u201ctrying naturally\u201d commandments. Its clients, including Unilever, MassMutual, Viacom and Cerner, also pay for genetic screening of embryos, with a typical cost of about $5,000, which helps identify genetic diseases and the embryos that are most likely to lead to a miscarriage.\\r\\n\u201cMost women without coverage or with traditional carrier coverage are shopping for cost on every procedure and adding up how many dollars they have left, so they make compromises on treatment,\u201d said David Schlanger, the chief executive of Progyny.\\r\\nThe typical compromise? Placing more than one embryo into a womb in hopes that one or more of those eggs will create the much-dreamed-of \u201clive birth.\u201d And when I.V.F. works too well, costs can be extraordinary for the delivery of twins and up, who can also require a great deal of care in and out of the hospital. For employers, offsetting these costs is appealing, and provides Progyny with a business angle.\\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had employers say, \u2018We had eight sets of twins last year, and triplets, from I.V.F. that cost us $9 million in medical. Can you help us?\u2019\u201d Mr. Schlanger said. Employees of Progyny clients who undergo I.V.F. are bearing one child per pregnancy at a higher rate than the national average. \\r\\nIn general, having one child at a time is preferable from a health perspective, though some people who want two or more children, total \u2014 and who have been on a lengthy and taxing \u201cfertility journey\u201d \u2014 may prefer twins in hopes of exiting the clinic forever.\\r\\nHillary Filstrup, 32, a claims adjuster for property damage in Dallas, has been trying to get pregnant for four years. She said she didn\u2019t have coverage through her employer, and she and her husband were considering cashing out a stock portfolio before her husband\u2019s company added I.V.F. coverage and contracted with Progyny.\\r\\nMs. Filstrup began I.V.F. in early January and plans to transfer one embryo. She has been diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome, endometriosis and a blocked left tube. At Christmas, her husband, a video-game enthusiast whom she describes as the \u201cleast romantic person in the world,\u201d gave her a silver Tiffany necklace with a pendant shaped like a lima bean, to represent their future bean. \\r\\n\u201cFor him to do something romantic meant more to me than anything in the world,\u201d she said. In her vows, she said she\u2019d \u201calways be player No. 2,\u201d and when she gets a positive pregnancy test she will give him a onesie with the phrase \u201cplayer No. 3 has entered the game.\u201d\\r\\nEmployer-led I.V.F. coverage also forces us to grapple with some thorny issues, such as the unfairness of the possibility that only the infertile affluent or employed can have their own children (minus the residents of Massachusetts or other states with mandates).\\r\\nAnd it\u2019s also a way to sidestep a national conversation about the merits of universal infertility coverage, which would include bigger questions, like whether bringing more children into an overpopulated, globally warming world is morally defensible. Or if people who would eventually conceive on their own are pushed into treatment by some of the nation\u2019s greedy fertility clinics. Or if the childless population must help other people bear children, even if children bring people health and happiness, and thus are perhaps justifiable medical expenses, like psychotherapy or some knee surgeries.\\r\\nFor now, the debate will center on practical, simpler questions, like: How many rounds of I.V.F. should be covered? When is infertility no longer considered treatable? Should employers cover the price of creating and transferring an embryo into a surrogate\u2019s womb? Should a woman using her own eggs become ineligible in the final childbearing years, say, at 43? \\r\\nAnd what do doctors think of this? Some, like Dr. James Grifo, the program director of the New York University Langone Fertility Center, say of the increase in coverage, \u201cin general, it\u2019s a good thing \u2014 people have coverage, and they can get the care they deserve.\u201d He added, \u201cbut insurance companies dictate what kind of care you can provide, and what you can do. They dictate protocols for clinical practice, and patients aren\u2019t protocols.\u201d\\r\\nIf infertility rates continue to rise in America, employers may be spending more on employees\u2019 health care plans, but be partly compensated by their loyalty and beavering work ethic. For Ms. Burns, the experience of looking around for another position in her field and learning that Sharp HealthCare\u2019s premium insurance included three rounds of I.V.F. coverage, and other businesses didn\u2019t, kept her in her current job. In fact, figuring out that some companies didn\u2019t cover I.V.F. made her \u201cmind blown,\u201d as she put it.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s changed my appreciation for a company that makes the choice to offer this, because there\u2019s not really any gain for them, and maybe there will be younger women who come up under me who will benefit,\u201d she said. \u201cIt made me take a step back and realize the type of people I work for.\u201d\\r\\nValeriya Safronova contributed reporting.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":409830808,\"description\":\"Fertility drugs and treatments are expensive, but employers have increasingly begun to cover their cost.\\r\",\"title\":\"I.V.F.

Understanding, let alone solving, the problem would take research.\\r\\nOne day, shortly after the epidemic began, Drew Harvell, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Cornell University who had been sounding the alarm about the disease, received a curious letter.\\r\\n\u201cI received a $400 check in the mail from a group of schoolchildren from Arkansas,\u201d Dr. Harvell said. \u201cThese kids were so upset about the idea of starfish disappearing from the oceans that they went out and they did this fund-raiser and raised 400 bucks for us to help in our research. I never asked them to do this. They just did it.\u201d\\r\\nDr. Harvell matched it with her own money, and a donor kicked in quite a bit more. \u201cThat was what funded some of our early surveys,\u201d she said. \u201cThese kids, who none of them had been to the Pacific Ocean, but they just needed to know those stars were there.\u201d \\r\\nOne of the ultimate results of the children\u2019s donation, a paper that sheds some light on the decline of the starfish, also known as sea stars, was published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances. The main suspect: our warming oceans.\\r\\nIn 2013, parts of the Pacific Ocean became unusually warm as part of a broader marine heat wave, nicknamed the Blob, that would last through 2015 and that was very likely exacerbated by human-caused global warming. But while the ocean warmed, it didn\u2019t warm evenly, making it hard to tell if the heat wave was contributing to the starfish deaths.\\r\\nIn the study, which was led jointly by Cornell and the University of California, Davis, Dr. Harvell and her colleagues compiled data from citizen-scientists and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  Then, they compared changes in the sunflower star population with changes in ocean temperature during the outbreak.\\r\\nWhile the disease affected 20 species of starfish, the researchers focused on the sunflower star because it was especially hard hit and because there was good historical data on its population before the epidemic. \\r\\nThe researchers found that the die-off of the sunflower star matched the pattern of heat spreading through the ocean.\\r\\nAccording to Rebecca Vega Thurber, an associate professor of environmental microbiology at Oregon State University, who was not involved in the study, \u201cWhat\u2019s really exciting about this paper is the really strong correspondence between this temperature anomaly that occurred during that year when the sea stars started dying.\u201d\\r\\nEverywhere the warming went, the sunflower stars sickened and died.\\r\\nThe study showed a correlation between warming temperatures and the spread of the disease, not a direct cause. But it corroborates a hypothesis that was initially questioned because the virus that researchers think is responsible also shows up in healthy sea stars. \\r\\n\u201cThat trigger, in the case of this paper, seems to be temperature,\u201d Dr. Vega Thurber said.\\r\\nDr. Vega Thurber pointed out that the presence of a particular pathogen does not necessarily mean a disease will develop.\\r\\nFor example, if you\u2019ve had chickenpox you are carrying the virus that causes shingles. Roughly a third of carriers will develop the disease, but two-thirds won\u2019t. It takes something to prompt its emergence.\\r\\nHeat has also been implicated as a trigger in the spread of a fungus that is wiping out frog and toad populations around the globe, as well as in coral diseases. In fact, when corals bleach or lose their symbiotic algae because of warming oceans, it\u2019s typically disease that ultimately kills them.\\r\\nThere are things we can do to help marine life, Dr. Harvell said. We can replant seagrass beds and protect mangroves, for instance. But, ultimately, we need to stop climate change, she said. The world\u2019s oceans have absorbed more than 90 percent of the atmospheric heat humans have caused by releasing greenhouse gases.\\r\\nWhile some affected sea stars have begun to return to American waters on the West Coast, the sunflower star has not returned off the lower 48 states.\\r\\nBut last summer, on the south coast of Alaska, researchers saw a glimmer of hope: the reappearance of sunflower stars, which had disappeared from Prince William Sound during the outbreak.\\r\\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know where exactly they came from,\u201d said Brenda Konar, a professor of marine biology at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, who was not involved in the Science Advances study. \u201cThey were pretty small and we don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to survive. So we\u2019re really curious about what we\u2019ll see next summer.\u201d\\r\\nIf they make a comeback, the Arkansas students, who are now teenagers, will likely be delighted.\\r\\nFor more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":829092437,\"description\":\"A new study sheds light on a huge die-off of starfish along the Pacific Coast from Mexico to Alaska.\\r\",\"title\":\"Scientists Single Out a Suspect in Starfish Carnage: Warming Oceans\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.17.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"The vaccine that prevents rotavirus, which can cause severe gastric problems in children, may have another benefit: lowering the risk for Type 1 diabetes in toddlers.\\r\\nRotavirus can leave children badly dehydrated and is sometimes fatal.

The game, better known as the \u201c10-Year Challenge,\u201d couldn\u2019t have been easier: Simply post two photos side by side \u2014 an early profile photo from 2009 next to a recent one \u2014 as proof positive of how you\u2019ve aged. Or, in many cases, miraculously not aged.\\r\\nIt was fun to watch, especially considering how good many of my friends looked. I posted on their feeds. \u201cAgeless!\u201d \u201cGorgeous X2.\u201d And, \u201cWhich is which?\u201d The whole exercise seemed harmless, if a bit self-involved, despite some concerns about privacy. But as the photos and comments continued to pour in, the challenge soon became a barometer of our views about aging, of how we define beauty, even of what it means to live a purposeful life.\\r\\nSomewhat reluctantly, I gave in and posted my then-and-now photos with the caption: \u201cOkay, okay.\u201d The feedback was fast and fine. \u201cHunky then, and more so NOW!\u201d \u201cU haven\u2019t aged at all.\u201d \u201cYou are positively ageless, not to mention ultra handsome.\u201d \u201cYou wear glasses now. That\u2019s the only difference I can see.\u201d\\r\\nI didn\u2019t mind the white lies, but I also felt like something of an impostor. Nothing in my post mentioned my Botox injections, my regular use of Retin-A and vitamin C serum. Nor did it note the major life transitions I\u2019d navigated in the past decade: the deaths of my parents, a divorce, the passing of my cocker spaniel, my sister\u2019s cancer diagnosis.\\r\\nKevin LaBar, associate director at Duke University\u2019s Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, said that two opposing forces might be at play in motivating someone to join the challenge. One he called \u201cage defying.\u201d Positive call outs would appeal to a person\u2019s \u201cpure vanity, with a superficial, narcissistic, ageist bent.\u201d The other he called \u201ccelebrating aging,\u201d or embracing an older self, wrinkles be damned. For those people, comments like \u201colder and wiser\u201d might resonate most.\\r\\nNot surprisingly, actors\u2019 challenge photos got a good bit of media attention, with most falling into the \u201cage defying\u201d bucket. Reese Witherspoon uploaded two striking head shots \u2014 then and now \u2014 and wrote: \u201cTime sure does fly by when you\u2019re having fun!\u201d Most of her Twitter followers responded along the lines of: \u201cYou actually got younger. What a vision.\u201d\\r\\nAmy Gorely, a director at Carolina Meadows, a retirement community in Chapel Hill, N.C., who started the \u201cBe Bold, Claim Old\u201d campaign, said such responses reflect the ageist nature of the game. \u201cThe challenge is inherently based on the societal belief that youth is the gold standard. If we look as youthful or \u2014 gasp! \u2014 better than we did 10 years ago, then society bestows value and we are \u2018successfully aging,\u2019\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cIf we do not look as good, then we failed or were hit hard.\u201d\\r\\nPadma Lakshmi, the host of \u201cTop Chef,\u201d wore a tiny two-piece in her current photo, set against a \u201cbefore\u201d photo that was 20 years old. The vast majority of the comments on her photos praised her \u201cnatural beauty.\u201d But then came the naysayers: \u201cThat don\u2019t even look like the same person with her eyes lips and cheeks done,\u201d noted joshuatrophywife. Another poster quoted Vivienne Lewis, a clinical psychologist who specializes in body image: \u201cThe message seems to be: women are rising up to be strong, fearless, and vibrant \u2014 we are here for the long haul! But you\u2019ll never see us age.\u201d\\r\\nDr. Lewis told me she worries that \u201ccomparing your life now to how it was 10 years ago can leave a person feeling hopeless, helpless, depressed and anxious.\u201d I hadn\u2019t really thought about those people who weren\u2019t posting: those who might have struggled with illness, divorce, or the death of a spouse or a child, or who don\u2019t like how they\u2019ve aged (weight gain, thinning hair, wrinkles, saggy skin). \\r\\nBut Dr. Lewis also sees an upside: \u201cFor those who perceive it as an opportunity to showcase personal growth or enduring social relationships, it can foster an enhanced sense of well-being that can positively contribute to the collective wisdom that accompanies aging.\u201d\\r\\nStill, most of the criticism of the challenge goes back to its ageism. Dr. LaBar is especially concerned about the impact of the challenge on older adults, whom he says are \u201cparticularly susceptible to the impact of negative implicit biases\u201d of ageist attitudes. He explained that \u201cin older adults, performance on memory tests and other cognitively-demanding tasks is impaired after participants had been given verbal reminders of negative aging stereotypes, like older adults are generally slow\u2019 and \u2018older adults tend to be forgetful.\u2019\u201d\\r\\nBut Dr. LaBar wasn\u2019t ready to write the challenge off. He told me that some people who have \u201cowned\u201d this challenge have used it to mark major life transitions\u201d \u2014 beating cancer, surviving a trauma, graduating from college. \u201cIn these cases, the challenge is used as a means of self-actualization, self-affirmation and pride, which is extremely powerful.\u201d\\r\\nMaybe in joining the challenge I was \u201ccelebrating\u201d my age rather than \u201cdefying\u201d it. Yes, my skin is dryer, my hair thinner and my cheeks succumbing to gravity. Under the hood my cholesterol is higher, as is my calcium level, an indicator of heart attack risk. My heart has also been battered by loss and sorrow, which reminds me of Elaine Stritch singing \u201cI\u2019m Still Here.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cI got through all of last year \\r\\nAnd I\u2019m here. \\r\\nLord knows, at least I was there, \\r\\nAnd I\u2019m here! \\r\\nLook who\u2019s here! \\r\\nI\u2019m still here!\u201d\\r\\nThat\u2019s the caption I should have written: \u201cI\u2019m still here!\u201d\\r\\nSteven Petrow, a Hillsborough, N.C., writer, is a regular contributor to Well.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":650611067,\"description\":\"It couldn\u2019t have been easier: Post an early profile photo on Facebook from 2009 next to a recent one \u2014 as proof positive of how you\u2019ve aged or, miraculously, not aged.\\r\",\"title\":\"What the \u201810-Year Challenge\u2019 Might Say About You, and Me\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"health.11.txt\"}],\"labelMap\":[[-1470032073,\"technology\"],[1620813714,\"science\"],[391006090,\"world\"],[1668447843,\"technology\"],[-1492412555,\"technology\"],[-1004715158,\"technology\"],[-727259249,\"technology\"],[1884837133,\"technology\"],[-1501740769,\"technology\"],[-634690071,\"business\"],[1125083330,\"world\"],[1229292121,\"world\"],[411863084,\"technology\"],[-1361980079,\"world\"],[489669537,\"technology\"],[-1709632295,\"technology\"],[326879815,\"technology\"],[650611067,\"technology\"],[494067761,\"health\"],[1957449218,\"technology\"],[-582939649,\"technology\"],[-1116953762,\"health\"],[-1521949661,\"world\"],[-1309279343,\"world\"],[-1781385766,\"technology\"],[-1919147376,\"technology\"],[288498403,\"world\"],[254470884,\"technology\"],[1823608100,\"technology\"],[-583240374,\"technology\"],[2025704318,\"technology\"],[-96237933,\"world\"],[409830808,\"technology\"],[829092437,\"technology\"],[-957075741,\"world\"]],\"confusionMatrix\":[[0,0,0,5,1],[0,0,0,2,2],[0,0,0,5,1],[0,0,1,5,0],[1,0,0,2,4]],\"confusionLabels\":[\"business\",\"health\",\"science\",\"technology\",\"world\"],\"relabelingLabelMap\":[[-1781385766,\"technology\"],[-1309279343,\"world\"],[-1116953762,\"health\"],[-582939649,\"technology\"],[494067761,\"health\"],[650611067,\"technology\"],[326879815,\"science\"],[-1709632295,\"business\"],[489669537,\"world\"],[411863084,\"world\"],[1125083330,\"science\"],[-634690071,\"health\"],[-1501740769,\"technology\"],[-727259249,\"technology\"],[-1492412555,\"world\"],[1668447843,\"business\"],[1792994965,\"health\"],[-2122718852,\"health\"],[-164165755,\"health\"],[1028732566,\"health\"],[1705918815,\"health\"],[-1222156594,\"world\"]],\"accuracy\":0.34285714285714286,\"correctRelabeled\":[-582939649,494067761],\"labelingPrecision\":0.3333333333333333,\"labelingRecall\":0.08695652173913043,\"correctAssignedItems\":[-1116953762,-582939649,494067761],\"assignmentPrecision\":0.3333333333333333,\"openedItems\":[],\"numOpenedItems\":0,\"selectedItems\":[],\"selectedInCategory\":0,\"selectionRecall\":null},{\"modelOperation\":\"update\",\"changedFiles\":[{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"The Thwaites Glacier on Antarctica\u2019s western coast has long been considered one of the most unstable on the continent. Now, scientists are worried about the discovery of an enormous underwater cavity that will probably speed up the glacier\u2019s decay.\\r\\nThe cavity is about two-thirds the area of Manhattan and nearly 1,000 feet tall, according to a study released Wednesday by NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The hulking chamber is large enough to have contained about 14 billion tons of ice \u2014 most of which the researchers say melted in three years.\\r\\nThe Thwaites Glacier, which is about the size of Florida, holds enough ice that if it all melted, it would raise the world\u2019s oceans by over two feet, a change that would threaten many coastal cities. Climate scientists tend to watch this glacier closely, usually alongside the nearby Pine Island Glacier, which is also flowing rapidly into the Amundsen Sea.\\r\\nRising sea levels, among the most obvious threats of global warming, are caused by the melting of ice sheets, as well as the thermal expansions of the ocean. A separate study released last week found that Antarctica was contributing more to rising sea levels than previously thought.\\r\\nThe Thwaites Glacier is one of the epicenters of this rapid deterioration. Already, the glacier is responsible for about 4 percent of the world\u2019s rising sea levels, according to a NASA news release. \\r\\nThe size and shape of water-filled cavities like the one discovered play an important role in the melting of glaciers, said Pietro Milillo, the NASA study\u2019s lead author. A cavity is created by relatively warm oceanwater melting the ice shelf. As the glacier becomes exposed to more warm-water currents, the ice will probably melt faster.\\r\\n\u201cThis is the ocean eating away at the ice,\u201d said Eric Rignot, an author of the study and a professor of Earth system science at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cIt\u2019s a direct impact of climate change on the glacier.\u201d\\r\\nNASA\u2019s study found that the ice shelf in that area melted at a rate of more than 650 feet per year between 2014 and 2017. That is enormous by Antarctica\u2019s standards, Professor Rignot said.\\r\\nBefore the researchers collected this data, they had no idea the cavity existed, said Dr. Milillo, a radar scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The first clues of the cavern\u2019s existence were revealed about three years ago in data collected by NASA\u2019s radar technology, which is flown above the glacier on airplanes and can penetrate deep below the surface of the ice.\\r\\nSridhar Anandakrishnan, a professor of geosciences and glaciology at Penn State who was not involved in the study, said that much of the area beneath glaciers\u2019 ice sheets remains a mystery to scientists. But the size and shape of underwater cavities, including the detailed bumps and hollows in the ice, are important in forming accurate models for the rate at which glaciers are melting and will melt in the future.\\r\\nProfessor Anandakrishnan said in a phone interview that he returned this week from a monthlong expedition in Antarctica, where he spent time living on and studying the Thwaites Glacier. He lived in a tent and traveled part of the time on skis, studying the mystery of what lies beneath the ice.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s flat and white and there\u2019s nobody there,\u201d he said of the glacier.\\r\\nThe gigantic cavity revealed in the study is at the junction between grounded and floating ice.

As the American authorities continue to build a case, prosecutors in Malaysia have already accused Goldman, which raised money for the $6 billion fund, of enriching itself at the expense of the Malaysian public.\\r\\nThe decision by bank\u2019s board to potentially claw back compensation, which was disclosed in a regulatory filing on Friday, reveals a degree of uncertainty within Goldman as to how the criminal investigation will shake out. The new provision is more specific than an existing rule that allows the board to claw back compensation from executives.\\r\\nThe bank is looking at paying several billion dollars in fines and restitution. Toward the end of last year, Goldman began setting aside money for the case, which is being pursued by federal prosecutors and bank regulators, as well as authorities in Malaysia.\\r\\nGoldman is eager to avoid a more punitive resolution, like a deferred prosecution agreement. In a deferred prosecution, the authorities ultimately decline to pursue charges if a company complies with certain requirements such as overhauling its compliance operation and paying hefty fines.\\r\\nOne former top Goldman banker has already pleaded guilty to federal charges in connection with the investigation, and a junior banker has also been charged. Federal prosecutors have said that at least $2.7 billion was looted from the fund by people close to Malaysia\u2019s former prime minister, Najib Razak. A financier, Jho Low, who was charged in the fraud, is a fugitive believed to be in China.\\r\\nGoldman Sachs was the primary banker for 1MDB, helping to sell nearly $6 billion in bonds. The bank has said it regretted the fraud carried out by its former partner, Tim Leissner, but has said it followed appropriate procedures and was cooperating with the investigation. The bank has said the scheme was carried out by rogue employees who deceived management at Goldman.\\r\\nThe bank said the clawback provision would give the board the \u201cflexibility to reduce the size of the award\u201d to senior executives, if necessary, as a result of the 1MDB case. Mr. Solomon replaced Mr. Blankfein as Goldman\u2019s chief executive on Oct. 1; Mr. Blankfein stayed on as chairman of the board through the end of the year.\\r\\nThe board set Mr. Solomon\u2019s total compensation package for 2018 at $23 million, a $2 million increase from the prior year. Mr. Blankfein\u2019s total compensation for 2018 was $20.5 million.\\r\\nThe filing on Friday seemed to be aimed, in part, at Mr. Blankfein. The board said it would \u201cdefer its decision\u201d on some awards for its long-term incentive plan for retired executives until more information is known about the investigation.\\r\\nUnder most compensation plans, top executives are awarded a bonus but then receive it in parts over the next three to five years. The system allows boards to \u201cclaw back\u201d pay before the executive receives it, in cases where missteps have occurred.\\r\\nBut compensation specialists said it was rare for a board to announce that it might take back pay for a specific cause.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s very unusual,\u201d said Alan Johnson of Johnson Associates, a compensation consulting firm. \u201cThey wanted to send a signal.\u201d\\r\\nThe forfeiture and clawback provision could cover about five top current and former executives at the bank, said a person familiar with the matter but not authorized to speak publicly on board matters. The holdback on the long-term compensation plan could apply to up to three retired executives, including Mr. Blankfein, Michael Sherwood and J. Michael Evans, the person said.\\r\\nThe grants under the long-term compensation plan go back to 2011, around the time Goldman began underwriting bond deals for 1MDB.\\r\\nOne former executive, Gary Cohn, who left Goldman to join the Trump administration, is not affected by the decision to defer compensation because he received a lump payout when he left the bank, the person familiar with the matter said.\\r\\nThe scandal has threatened to tarnish the tenure of Mr. Blankfein, who helped navigate Goldman through the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. Blankfein attended at least one meeting with Mr. Low, in December 2012. That meeting was held at Goldman\u2019s headquarters in Lower Manhattan.\\r\\nThe meeting, which was facilitated by Mr. Leissner, took place even though others at Goldman had expressed wariness about Mr. Low.\\r\\nSpeaking at a conference in November, when the charges against the two former Goldman employees were made public, Mr. Blankfein said, \u201cThese are guys who evaded our safeguards, and lie.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1709632295,\"description\":\"The investment bank\u2019s board adopted a provision to claw back, or reduce, some of the pay packages they received last year, depending on the outcome of a federal inquiry into a fraud in Malaysia.\\r\",\"title\":\"Goldman Sachs Suggests Current and Former Executives Could Lose Money Over 1MDB\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"business.2.txt\"}],\"labelMap\":[[-1470032073,\"technology\"],[1620813714,\"science\"],[391006090,\"world\"],[1668447843,\"technology\"],[-1492412555,\"business\"],[-1004715158,\"technology\"],[-727259249,\"technology\"],[1884837133,\"science\"],[-1501740769,\"technology\"],[-634690071,\"business\"],[1125083330,\"world\"],[1229292121,\"world\"],[411863084,\"technology\"],[-1361980079,\"world\"],[489669537,\"technology\"],[-1709632295,\"business\"],[326879815,\"science\"],[650611067,\"technology\"],[494067761,\"health\"],[1957449218,\"technology\"],[-582939649,\"technology\"],[-1116953762,\"health\"],[-1521949661,\"world\"],[-1309279343,\"world\"],[-1781385766,\"technology\"],[-1919147376,\"technology\"],[288498403,\"world\"],[254470884,\"technology\"],[1823608100,\"technology\"],[-583240374,\"technology\"],[2025704318,\"technology\"],[-96237933,\"world\"],[409830808,\"technology\"],[829092437,\"technology\"],[-957075741,\"world\"]],\"confusionMatrix\":[[0,0,0,4,1],[0,0,0,2,2],[0,0,0,4,1],[0,0,2,4,0],[2,0,0,1,4]],\"confusionLabels\":[\"business\",\"health\",\"science\",\"technology\",\"world\"],\"relabelingLabelMap\":[[-1781385766,\"technology\"],[-1309279343,\"world\"],[-1116953762,\"health\"],[-582939649,\"technology\"],[494067761,\"health\"],[650611067,\"technology\"],[326879815,\"science\"],[-1709632295,\"business\"],[489669537,\"world\"],[411863084,\"world\"],[1125083330,\"science\"],[-634690071,\"health\"],[-1501740769,\"technology\"],[-727259249,\"technology\"],[-1492412555,\"world\"],[1668447843,\"business\"],[1792994965,\"health\"],[-2122718852,\"health\"],[-164165755,\"health\"],[1028732566,\"health\"],[1705918815,\"health\"],[-1222156594,\"world\"]],\"accuracy\":0.37142857142857144,\"correctRelabeled\":[-582939649,494067761,326879815],\"labelingPrecision\":0.375,\"labelingRecall\":0.13636363636363635,\"correctAssignedItems\":[-1116953762,-582939649,494067761,326879815,-1709632295],\"assignmentPrecision\":0.375,\"openedItems\":[],\"numOpenedItems\":0,\"selectedItems\":[],\"selectedInCategory\":0,\"selectionRecall\":null},{\"modelOperation\":\"add\",\"changedFiles\":[{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"BERLIN \u2014 A German museum dedicated to sausages has stirred an unexpected controversy in announcing its new location: a site where prisoners of a concentration camp were once used as slave labor for the Nazi war machine.\\r\\nThe German Bratwurst Museum announced on Wednesday that it would be moving \u2014 complete with a cannon with a giant sausage in place of its barrel \u2014 to an industrial lot in M\u00fchlhausen, a small city near the geographical center of Germany.\\r\\nHours later, it emerged that the same site had been during World War II a satellite of the Buchenwald concentration camp, with a munitions factory that used forced labor. Most of those who lived there were Jewish women from Poland and Hungary who had been transported from Auschwitz.\\r\\n\u201cOf course we are upset about it,\u201d said Reinhard Schramm, who leads a Jewish community group in the state of Thuringia.\\r\\nThomas M\u00e4user, the deputy director of the museum, said on Friday: \u201cWe were totally bowled over. I understand the reaction, but we had no idea.\u201d\\r\\nThe Bratwurst Museum had unwittingly stepped into a long-running debate about what to do with the thousands of places that were once part of the Nazis\u2019 extensive machinery of death.\\r\\nModern Germany has many opportunities to stumble onto the infrastructure of the Holocaust and other remnants of its Nazi past. As many as 800 locations across the country were once part of the concentration camp network, and a thousand more are sites where slave labor was used. Buchenwald alone had 139 external sites.\\r\\n\u201cWe know that we can\u2019t prevent all use at all of these sites,\u201d Mr. Schramm said. He suggested that Jewish and victim groups be included in discussions about how the sites are developed.\\r\\n\u201cThis time it is a bratwurst museum, next time it could be an AfD meeting space,\u201d he said, referring to the far-right party Alternative for Germany, whose leaders have challenged the country\u2019s atonement for the Holocaust and for its Nazi crimes. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow that to happen.\u201d\\r\\nBetween October 1944 and February 1945, as many as 700 inmates were forced to build weapons at the satellite camp known as Martha II. When the camp closed, they were transported to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.\\r\\n\u201cThe threat was always there: If they couldn\u2019t work they\u2019d be sent back to Auschwitz,\u201d said Rikola-Gunnar L\u00fcttgenau, a spokesman for Buchenwald Memorial Center.\\r\\nThe problem with such locations \u201chas been a common theme since 1945 \u2014 a negation of history in the use of these historical crime scenes,\u201d Mr. L\u00fcttgenau said.\\r\\nLuxury condos built and sold in a former Gestapo headquarters in Hamburg led to an outcry last year. The compound that includes the famous water tower in the Prenzlauer Berg district of Berlin, which now houses some of the city\u2019s more expensive dwellings, was part of a network of temporary detention centers used by the Nazis in the months after they took power in 1933.\\r\\nThe Bratwurst museum, now located in a small town near M\u00fchlhausen, claims to have the world\u2019s largest bratwurst, and draws tourists, German and foreign, to its sausage-themed exhibition of \u201cart, cult kitsch.\u201d\\r\\nMr. M\u00e4user said the club that runs the museum learned of the new location\u2019s dark history only after it had proudly announced the move. The fault, the club contends, lies with the city and the lot\u2019s owner, for not disclosing the property\u2019s full background when offering it to the museum.\\r\\n\u201cIt was an army base\u201d when the area was part of East Germany, Mr. M\u00e4user said, \u201cand after reunification a refugee camp for a while \u2014 you\u2019d think someone would have said something then.\u201d\\r\\nMr. M\u00e4user said the club did not yet know how the controversy would affect the plans for the museum. \u201cInternational understanding and human rights are part of our statute, which is why we have so many international members,\u201d he added.\\r\\nThe owner of the site, Jan Kratochwil, seemed less sensitive to concerns about its history, suggesting that inmates actually liked being in the camp, according to Bild, the German newspaper that interviewed him.\\r\\nMr. Kratochwil could not be reached for comment.\\r\\nOn Thursday evening, the M\u00fchlhausen City Council voted to allow zoning for the museum and to create a memorial on the site, according to local news reports.\\r\\nThe vote came hours after the Israeli historian Saul Friedl\u00e4nder addressed the German Parliament, warning of the perils of rising anti-Semitism. The speech, delivered in German, was part of the annual commemoration of the liberation of Auschwitz by Soviet troops in 1945.\\r\\nMr. L\u00fcttgenau said he did not blame the museum for its plans.

They had not even struck me as unusual, since I\u2019d been told I would not be entirely asleep.\\r\\nIn the first, I awoke during a finger tendon repair to the sound of a metal rod being hammered into my joint. I don\u2019t think I spoke or even opened my eyes. I felt no pain, or even fear. I simply felt a curious fascination with what was happening around me.\\r\\nMy second awakening was during a bizarre pacemaker placement, when I opened my eyes to discover that my face had been covered with what I imagined was a blue hospital gown. There was a bright light shining through the fabric, and though I felt no pain, I was frightened by a strange fluttering in my chest as the device was being tested. I started to sob uncontrollably, my chest heaving, tears running down the sides of my face and into my ears. \u201cDo you feel any pain?\u201d the surgeon kept asking, and I told him no. \u201cI\u2019m just very emotional,\u201d I remember saying. But the fear soon abated.\\r\\nIt was only the third awakening that left me haunted by flashbacks and nightmares. What had gone wrong?\\r\\nI soon learned that I am part of only a tiny percentage of people who remember unsettling experiences under conscious sedation. Only three out of every 10,000 people report \u201cundesired awareness\u201d from nongeneral anesthesia, a number only slightly higher than the two out of every 10,000 patients who report this under general anesthesia, according to a study led by Dr. George Mashour, a neuroanesthesiologist at the University of Michigan and one of the world\u2019s experts on anesthesia awareness. While some patients expect, or even want, to be awake during certain procedures, especially colonoscopies, \u201cI don\u2019t think any clinician would want somebody to be terrified or in pain,\u201d Dr. Mashour said.\\r\\nBut it happens.\\r\\nHis research, using the American Society of Anesthesiologists\u2019 Anesthesia Awareness Registry, a voluntary registry of patients with memories under conscious sedation or general anesthesia, showed that 78 percent of those reporting awareness under conscious sedation felt distress, and 40 percent had long-term psychological sequelae, including post-traumatic stress disorder.\\r\\nThere has been extensive research and debate on how to prevent these awakenings, known as \u201canesthesia awareness,\u201d under general anesthesia. But far less is known about their impact on people undergoing conscious sedation, which is growing in popularity and estimated to account for half of all anesthesia administrations in the United States within 10 years. \\r\\nOften requiring no anesthesiologist, no operating room and not even a hospital setting, conscious sedation is now being used increasingly for dental work, plastic surgery, heart rhythm corrections, electroconvulsive therapy, and many more procedures performed by a growing range of practitioners, including certified anesthesiologist assistants and nurse anesthetists.\\r\\nPart of the problem is that there is no firm definition of conscious sedation, which involves a cocktail of pain control, anxiety control and amnesia in amounts that can vary between patients, procedures and practitioners, says Dr. Andrew Davidson, head of anesthesia research at the Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute in Melbourne, Australia.\\r\\n\u201cConscious sedation is a bit of an art,\u201d Dr. Davidson said. \u201cSome people say it\u2019s actually harder to do than general anesthetic, because it\u2019s actually more difficult to titrate the drugs to get exactly what you want.\u201d\\r\\nIn contrast to general anesthesia, in which the goals are well-defined \u2014 no pain, no awareness, no memory \u2014 conscious sedation is something of a gray zone, where the boundaries between consciousness and unconsciousness are blurred, where patients are sometimes expected to be semi-awake and responsive, and where their distress could potentially be ignored, because amnesia usually sets in.\\r\\n\u201cWith conscious sedation, I think physicians recognize that quite a lot of the time their patients will actually be distressed, but they\u2019re relying on the fact that most are not going to remember it,\u201d Dr. Davidson said. It is obviously not the goal, he added, \u201cbut it\u2019s hard to get the dose right.\u201d As he wrote in the Journal of Medical Ethics, \u201cIn many cases, the patient will wince or wriggle during the procedure \u2014 some may even tell you it hurts.\u201d But \u201cthe vast majority won\u2019t remember a thing,\u201d\\r\\nIn my case, plagued by my distressing memories, I was diagnosed with acute stress disorder, a transient form of PTSD. I spoke to a therapist, sought clarification from my physician, and am looking for ways to avoid a negative experience the next time.\\r\\nBut what if, like most people, I had actually forgotten that panic and struggle on the table? Might I still have experienced the nightmares and anxiety, with no explanation for them? And might someone with a tendency toward depression or anxiety trace their problems back to forgotten experiences under sedation?\\r\\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of evidence\u201d that even without an explicit memory of surgery, humans can form implicit or subconscious memories under anesthesia, said Dr. Aeyal Raz, an anesthesiologist at the University of Wisconsin. \u201cThere is a trace of the event, a memory, left in the brain. However, it cannot be accessed with conscious thoughts and the person does not recall the learning event. Nonetheless, it may affect future feelings and behavior.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cResearch in psychology suggests that even this very rudimentary memory activity may have profound effects on behavior or emotion,\u201d wrote Jackie Andrade, a psychologist at the University of Plymouth, in a review of the topic. \u201cIt seems plausible that negative experiences during surgery could reduce patients\u2019 well-being on recovery, but it is hard to prove,\u201d she told me.\\r\\nBut Dr. Davidson feels the evidence for implicit memory after anesthesia is \u201cvery mixed, and it is a very long bow to pull to say it has long lasting effects.\u201d\\r\\nIn an ongoing study, Dr. Raz\u2019s team is looking at the link between awareness and memory formation under anesthesia and psychological symptoms a month later. \u201cThe numbers are too small to have conclusive results yet, so I should be careful with the interpretation, but we\u2019ve had a small number of recall episodes, with most of these episodes related to PTSD symptoms, mostly to sleep problems, at 30 days,\u201d he said. He said that many more patients were aware during the procedure \u2014 identified by asking them to move their arm during surgery \u2014 but did not remember it, and among these patients, it\u2019s too early to say whether there is any increased risk of PTSD.\\r\\n\u201cWhen I speak with the patients before giving them sedation, I tell them that they\u2019ll be awake and may remember or not, though most don\u2019t, and that I will be with them, and that if they\u2019re in pain or uncomfortable they can tell me and I\u2019ll give them more sedation or pain medication,\u201d Dr. Raz said. \u201cI hope that this allows them some control of the situation and a better understanding, which may help in preventing PTSD.\u201d\\r\\nIn a paper in the Journal of Medical Ethics, professor Walter Glannon, a biomedical ethicist and philosopher at the University of Calgary, explores the idea of offering an antidote to soften the sting of traumatic memories. Propranolol, for instance, is a drug that does not induce amnesia but can dampen the emotional content of a memory, especially if given within six hours of the traumatic experience.\\r\\nAs the popularity of conscious sedation increases, research continues. But what\u2019s still largely missing from this conversation are the patients\u2019 stories. Experts say that the vast majority of traumatic experiences under anesthesia and sedation are most likely never reported because they are often so ephemeral and disconnected.

Apple responded by cutting off Facebook\u2019s access to apps and updates that it was working on internally, causing chaos among the company\u2019s software engineers.\\r\\nThe move is the clearest sign yet that the cold war between Facebook and Apple over data use and privacy is heating up.\\r\\nMr. Cook, who has called privacy a \u201cfundamental human right\u201d and taken Facebook and Google to task for the misuse of user data in the past, could effectively become a technology regulator of last resort \u2014 using the power of Apple\u2019s iOS operating system as a cudgel to force software companies to respect user privacy and play by the rules, or risk losing access to millions of iPhone users.\\r\\nThe latest battle came on Wednesday, after TechCrunch reported on a Facebook program, known as Project Atlas, that paid users $20 in exchange for installing an app for Apple devices called Facebook Research. The program, offered to teenagers as well as adults, gave Facebook the ability to track app use, the websites users visited, the Amazon purchases they made and other intimate data.\\r\\nThe problem is that Facebook loaded the app onto users\u2019 devices using a kind of fast-track installation that bypasses Apple\u2019s normal App Store download process. This ability, known as side-loading, is available only to companies that are enrolled in Apple\u2019s enterprise developer program, and that agree to side-load apps only for internal testing, not for public use.\\r\\nApple was not happy, and cut off Facebook\u2019s enterprise developer access for all of its apps, not just the offending research app.\\r\\n\u201cWe designed our Enterprise Developer Program solely for the internal distribution of apps within an organization,\u201d an Apple spokesman said. \u201cFacebook has been using their membership to distribute a data-collecting app to consumers, which is a clear breach of their agreement with Apple.\u201d\\r\\nFacebook, which reported strong earnings on Wednesday despite the missteps, is negotiating with Apple to restore its developer access. A Facebook spokesman declined to comment.\\r\\n(On Wednesday, TechCrunch reported that Google had a similar research app, called Screenwise Meter. In a statement, Google said it was disabling the app, which it said \u201cshould not have operated under Apple\u2019s developer enterprise program.\u201d)\\r\\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Apple took a firm stand here. But if Mr. Cook truly wants to protect Apple users from privacy-violating apps, he could remove all of Facebook\u2019s products \u2014 including Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 from the App Store until the company can prove, in a real and measurable way, that it cares about its users\u2019 privacy.\\r\\nShutting off Facebook\u2019s access to Apple devices would be a radical step, tantamount to declaring war on a major competitor. But Apple has banned developers for smaller infractions in the past. And in the absence of government regulation, there may be no other option for bringing the company to heel on privacy.\\r\\nWould temporarily cutting off Facebook\u2019s Apple apps be an effective deterrent? Absolutely. In less than a day, Apple\u2019s move to revoke Facebook\u2019s developer certificate has reportedly become a \u201ccritical problem\u201d for the company\u2019s developers. Hundreds of millions of people use Facebook through their iPhones, and without access to Apple\u2019s App Store, Facebook would see an immediate and devastating hit to its bottom line. The ban would quickly become an existential threat, and improving privacy on its apps would become an all-hands-on-deck project for the company\u2019s leadership.\\r\\nWould it be fair? Yes. Facebook\u2019s privacy violations over the years have been appalling, and its executives have blatantly evaded the rules that Google and Apple, the makers of the two largest mobile operating systems, have put in place to protect their users from being exploited by data-hungry app developers. In emails released late last year, Facebook executives were shown plotting to snoop on Android users\u2019 call and text logs without triggering a permission pop-up. And Facebook\u2019s Onavo VPN app was pulled from Apple\u2019s App Store last year for excessive data collection.\\r\\nWould cracking down on Facebook backfire on Apple? Possibly. Facebook\u2019s apps are some of the most popular offerings on Apple devices, and without access to their Instagram and Facebook feeds, some iPhone users might get frustrated and switch to Android. But this abandonment would happen slowly, not all at once. (IPhone users could still access Facebook\u2019s products through their mobile web browsers.) And more likely, given how heavily Facebook relies on Apple\u2019s platform, Facebook would almost certainly blink first, and make the necessary changes to get back into Apple\u2019s good graces.\\r\\nIs such a big crackdown necessary? It probably is, if Apple is truly serious about protecting privacy. Time and time again, Facebook has shown that it cannot be trusted to protect users\u2019 privacy unless it is forced to do so. And while regulators have fined Facebook for privacy violations, those punishments rarely amount to anything truly meaningful \u2014 at most, the company pays a few million dollars, promises to do better next time, and goes right back to work.\\r\\nWould punishing Facebook be an abuse of Apple\u2019s power? Arguably, yes. It\u2019s problematic that by virtue of their strangleholds on the Apple and Android operating systems, Apple and Google have control over huge swaths of the tech industry. And Apple\u2019s own record on privacy is hardly spotless \u2014 just this week, the company was forced to shut down the FaceTime feature because of a bug that let users snoop on one another\u2019s phones.\\r\\nBut aggressive behavior among tech companies, for much less noble motives, is business as usual \u2014 Facebook, for example, routinely cuts off data access to rival apps like Twitter, Vine, and Prisma. And until government regulators impose rules on the tech giants, the most effective regulation on tech industry excesses may need to happen between companies.\\r\\nIt\u2019s bizarre and somewhat troubling that Apple could unilaterally punish a competitor for its privacy sins. (Imagine if McDonald\u2019s could shut down Burger King franchises for health code violations, with little explanation and no recourse for appeal.) But it\u2019s hard to argue with Apple\u2019s decision here. It made rules governing what developers for Apple products were allowed to do, Facebook broke them, and it\u2019s now paying a price.\\r\\nApple\u2019s defense of user privacy, while certainly self-interested, is a boon to its users and a lever for change within the tech industry. And if Mr. Cook wants to take a strong stand against app developers that routinely violate users\u2019 trust, he could start with the biggest privacy violator of all. Facebook won\u2019t change on its own, but a chastening from Apple might be what the company needs to get its act together.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":2064830945,\"description\":\"The cold war between Facebook and Apple over data use and privacy is heating up.

Bystanders, passers-by, people with their arms in the air, and journalists have been hit. Jaws have been fractured, hands crushed, eyes shot out.\\r\\nTheir use \u2014 overuse, critics say, with more than 9,200 firings recorded, including forbidden shots to the head \u2014 have come to symbolize an increasingly fierce police response to the Yellow Vests, especially after a protest leader\u2019s eye was seriously injured last week.\\r\\nBut in its ruling upholding the use of the projectiles, the high court, called the Council of State, instead underlined the violence of the Yellow Vest protests, which at their peak in December shook the government of President Emmanuel Macron.\\r\\nAnd the court noted fears that this violence would continue, as the Yellow Vests prepared for a 12th consecutive weekend of protests this Saturday, organized as a tribute to victims of what is deemed police violence. Protesters planned to brandish portraits of the injured leader, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Rodrigues, his eye shut tight; the police are investigating that shooting.\\r\\nThe court\u2019s decision came in the same week Mr. Macron\u2019s government bolstered its anti-Yellow Vest arsenal on the legislative front, pushing through much of a tough new \u201canti-vandals\u201d law in the National Assembly, including a provision allowing officials to bar suspect individuals from taking part in protests, and a ban on face masks.\\r\\nAfter weeks of violent protests punctuated by calls for his resignation, Mr. Macron has only recently been seen as regaining the upper hand, pushing a new strategy of dialogue with citizens in meetings all over France. Meanwhile, his government has put an increasingly negative spin on the protests: \u201cThese are not demonstrations, they are urban riots,\u201d said an Interior Ministry official, Pascale L\u00e9glise, at an emergency hearing before the high court on Wednesday.\\r\\nThe government has insisted that the 40-millimeter rubber-bullet guns and their projectiles, about the size of golf balls, are essential tools for the police. But their use makes France an outlier with respect to Western Europe, if not the United States. French police officers, and particularly the heavily armored paramilitary anti-riot CRS force, have historically been granted wide latitude in suppressing demonstrations.\\r\\nAmerican police officers made frequent use of rubber bullets during the protests in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014, sometimes causing serious injuries. In France the country\u2019s official human rights watchdog has urged banning them for crowd control.\\r\\nStill, the strategy of an uncompromising police response to the Yellow Vests \u2014 heavy use of tear gas, nonlethal rubber bullets and water cannons \u2014 appears to have helped reduce the severe urban vandalism of the protests\u2019 early days, when the streets of Paris\u2019s luxury districts were littered with burning cars and smashed store windows.\\r\\nThis strategy has been met with approval from a key right-leaning constituency being wooed by Mr. Macron, whose approval ratings have only recently begun to edge up after sagging to record lows.\\r\\nHis political difficulties are not over, however, and he acknowledged to French journalists this week that he was still \u201cwalking on ice\u201d even as the Yellow Vests have begun to form candidate lists for the coming European elections.\\r\\nHuman rights activists have criticized the toll so far exacted by the so-called \u201cdefense bullet-launchers\u201d: more than 350 people, including dozens of journalists, have been wounded or mutilated, with 159 struck in the head and as many as 17 losing eyes. The police acknowledge there have been four blindings.\\r\\n\u201cThis weapon is simply too dangerous to use in a demonstration,\u201d Regis Froger, a lawyer for the leftist union CGT, said during the emergency hearing this week before the high court. \u201cIt\u2019s a weapon designed to wound and mutilate,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there is a real dissuasive effect on the right to demonstrate.\u201d\\r\\nTo his left in the ornate court chamber sat four Yellow Vest victims of shootings who had traveled to Paris from the southern city of Montpellier, one still bearing a livid scar on his face. Another, Cynthia Lubin, a 31-year-old saleswoman shot in the forehead, wept.\\r\\nBut the French court on Friday endorsed the police argument that it could not keep the peace without rubber bullets, even as it noted that \u201cvery serious\u201d injuries had resulted.\\r\\nThe \u201cnumerous demonstrations\u201d all over France \u201chave frequently been accompanied by gratuitous violence, assaults, vandalism and destruction,\u201d the court said. \u201cBecause it is impossible to rule out such incidents in future demonstrations, it is necessary for law enforcement to continue to use these weapons, particularly appropriate in these situations,\u201d the court wrote in its decision.\\r\\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t talked about the police victims,\u201d Ms. L\u00e9glise of the Interior Ministry said during the emergency hearing. \u201cIt would be irresponsible to ban it.\u201d\\r\\nThe human rights lawyers immediately vowed to appeal Friday\u2019s decision. \u201cIt\u2019s a disappointment,\u201d said Patrice Spinosi of the LDH, the Human Rights League. \u201cWe haven\u2019t succeeded in preventing it for this weekend. There will be consequences. And we\u2019re going to appeal.\u201d\\r\\nPolice specialists have weighed in against the rubber-bullet guns, comparing France\u2019s stance unfavorably with that of other European countries \u2014 Austria, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Britain and Germany for the most part, among others \u2014 that ban the weapon.\\r\\n\u201cFrom the medical point of view there are good reasons not to use it,\u201d said Sebastian Roch\u00e9 of the CNRS research institute. \u201cAnd the countries that forbid them are the most thoroughgoing democracies.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s a question of democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can do better without these weapons.

But the company said on Thursday that growth slowed from its usual breakneck pace \u2014 and it came at a cost, with the company spending far more on shipping to win customers.\\r\\nWhile strong, the latest quarterly results suggested that Amazon\u2019s retail business not only faces more competition, it is also maturing. The company reported that its revenue from retail sales and services grew 17 percent to almost $65 billion globally, while its shipping costs rose 23 percent, to $9 billion, compared with the same quarter a year ago.\\r\\nThe company is compensating for slowing growth in e-commerce by expanding its fast-moving, highly profitable cloud and advertising businesses. Over all, the company produced a profit of $3 billion in the quarter, up more than 60 percent from the same period a year earlier.\\r\\nCompetition for shoppers over the holidays was intense and expensive, as other big retailers stepped up their promotions. Target offered free two-day shipping, no matter how small an order, and Walmart and others tried to maximize use of their physical stores, an advantage they have over Amazon. On Christmas Eve, Best Buy customers could order products online from store inventory as late as 5 p.m. and pick them up just an hour later.\\r\\nAmazon pushed back with expanded free shipping to all customers until about a week before Christmas, and made more products eligible for free one-day shipping for Prime members.\\r\\nBut revenue from online shopping slowed, in part because now most of Amazon\u2019s retail sales come from third-party merchants selling on its marketplace rather than from Amazon\u2019s own inventory. Amazon gets only a slice of this revenue.\\r\\nIn addition, the growth of Prime membership, which costs $119 a year, is approaching a plateau. About 56 percent of American households will be Prime members this year, up only slightly from 53 percent in 2018, Morgan Stanley estimated. Prime members spend far more on the site, making them crucial to increasing sales.\\r\\nAnother risk awaits the company: India. The country, which Amazon has made its most important emerging market, imposed new regulations that prohibit foreign e-commerce companies from owning a stake in sellers that offer items on their sites. That has limited the selection available on Amazon by almost a third virtually overnight. Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s finance chief, cited \u201cuncertainty\u201d in India as a reason Amazon predicted lower revenue for the next quarter than analysts had expected.\\r\\nEven as sales growth has slowed, though, Amazon has increased profit margins.\\r\\nThe third-party merchant business, for example, is generally more profitable than when Amazon sells products it buys directly because the costs are lower.\\r\\nIt has also tried to squeeze costs from its operations. Mr. Olsavsky pointed to how the number of employees grew 38 percent in 2017, excluding acquisitions, but just 14 percent in 2018. There were similar trends in the construction of data centers and warehouses. \u201cWe had a banking, if you will, of some large expansions in the prior two years,\u201d Mr. Olsavsky said on a call with analysts.\\r\\n\u201cThe theme has been Amazon shifting from a product seller to a fee collector,\u201d said Simeon Siegel, an analyst at Instinet. The shift from growth to profit is common as companies mature, he said: \u201cWe are going through growing pains.\u201d\\r\\nShares in the company fell nearly 5 percent in after-hours trading, after the quarterly results were released.\\r\\nAmazon\u2019s two great profit engines are not in the core business of selling and fulfilling items, however \u2014 they are in cloud computing and advertising.\\r\\nAmazon Web Services, the leading provider of cloud computing, grew 45 percent, with $7.4 billion in sales and almost $2.2 billion in operating income.\\r\\nAfter several years of dominating the market, which it essentially helped create, Amazon now faces robust competition, including from Microsoft. At its annual cloud conference in November, Amazon announced a number of new products, including AWS Outposts, which lets companies use a single set of tools to manage data across cloud and local servers, an area known as \u201chybrid cloud\u201d where Microsoft has had success.\\r\\nMr. Olsavsky said the company had been hiring aggressively to bring in more engineers and sales staff for the cloud offerings, saying \u201cAWS maintained a very strong growth rate and continued to deliver for customers.\u201d\\r\\nInvestors have increasingly looked to Amazon\u2019s ad business, which displays ads on its own site as well as across the web based on consumer shopping habits, as a major driver of profit. The \u201cOther\u201d business unit, which analysts say is almost entirely advertising, had almost $3.4 billion in revenue during the quarter, and more than $10 billion over the last year.\\r\\n\u201cThey have long been a sleeping giant and had capacity to build a big advertising business,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-2030941738,\"description\":\"The company is compensating for slowing growth in e-commerce by expanding its fast-moving, highly profitable cloud and advertising businesses.\\r\",\"title\":\"Amazon\u2019s Sales Growth Slows, Even as Cloud Business Stays Hot\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.23.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"The first challenge you face on arriving somewhere new is usually how to get around, but the right technology can make it easier.

Citymapper helps you figure all that out, and it works in 39 cities around the world, including Tokyo, Copenhagen and Sydney. Plug in your starting and ending points, and get a list of possible routes organized by mode of transport. The app also displays trip duration and any applicable prices (like estimated cab or subway fares), along with tips for where to sit on the train and which station exit to use to reach your destination faster.\\r\\nYou can receive alerts when it\u2019s time to disembark, and when there are line delays or closures. You can even use it to plan your daily commute, and get a warning to leave before you\u2019re late for work, or estimates on when you\u2019ll get home depending on when you leave the office. The app also shows how many shared bikes and free bike spaces are available at a given location in real time, making pickup and drop-off more efficient.\\r\\n\\r\\nExpand your ride-sharing horizons\\r\\nDepending on your destination, you may have to break your Uber or Lyft habit when you arrive: the former is banned in several European countries and parts of Australia, and operates in a gray area in others, like in Hong Kong . The latter only operates in the United States.\\r\\nYou may also prefer to hail rides from licensed taxis. You don\u2019t have to give up the convenience of an app to do it, though. Gett will get you a cab in Israel, Russia and the United Kingdom; and in New York City, the company has merged with ride-sharing platform Juno. Gett allows you to book a ride with an economy or higher-end car up to two weeks in advance, or on-demand. Like any good ride-sharing app, your driver\u2019s location is displayed in real time while you wait to be picked up, but with Gett, you can pay in cash or through the app. \\r\\nTaxify is a similar option that\u2019s available in 60 cities across 29 countries, including throughout Europe and Africa. Like Uber or Lyft, its drivers are not actual taxi drivers however; the company is called Txfy in France to avoid confusion. Taxify offers different vehicle tiers, displays real-time driver location and it lets you pay through the app. Some destinations offer alternatives to cars. For example, you can hail motorcycles and auto-rickshaws in East Africa, and rent GPS-enabled scooters in Paris.\\r\\nMore options to get out of town\\r\\nIf you want to explore Europe or North America without renting a car, Wanderu can help you find and book bus, train and ferry tickets instead. The app aggregates options from big-name carriers like Amtrak and Deutsche Bahn, as well as niche brands, like FlixBus and the Tallink Silja Line, a Baltic Sea ferry service.\\r\\nYou can quickly sort options according to your schedule, budget and preferred mode of transport \u2014 maybe you want the cheapest overnight bus or the earliest luxury train.\\r\\nCurrently, Wanderu has a separate flight finder powered by Skyscanner, but flights will be integrated into overall search results next year, so you\u2019ll be able to see airfares along with ferries and ground transportation options in one place.\\r\\nA website called Bookaway provides a similar service in developing countries, including throughout Southeast Asia.

The chain stocked cat food and dog toys, but also hawked live birds and their cages, reptiles and terrariums, and small animals like hamsters and the wheels that kept them busy.\\r\\nBeyond supplying pets and pet products, Petland offered something for the animal-averse as well: its commercials. Punctuated by an innocuous yet mellifluous jingle, the advertisements left an indelible impression on countless New Yorkers who watched local television in the 1980s and 1990s.\\r\\nAdam Moss, 27, who grew up in Highland Park, N.J., remembered seeing the company\u2019s commercials \u201ceverywhere and every day.\u201d When he heard the company might close, he went back to listen to old commercials he had saved and others he found on YouTube.\\r\\n\u201cI lived in the area so long they\u2019ve become iconic to me,\u201d Mr. Moss said. \u201cIt was so disappointing. I cried for a while after relistening to some of them.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Padron showed up often in the commercials. With his strong New York accent and bushy mustache, he stood out on local channels as he walked through the aisles of Petland Discounts stores, promising anything a pet lover could need at a reasonable cost.\\r\\nAt the company\u2019s peak, Petland Discounts ran 118 locations across three states. As of this week, it operated 78, Ms. Eisenberg told Newsday.\\r\\nPetland Discounts said in the notices it filed that it would close all of its New Jersey and Connecticut stores by March 19 and its New York locations one month later.\\r\\nSteven Hernandez, 17, said the closure of the store in Sunset Park would complicate his procurement of live crickets for his two pet bearded dragons.\\r\\nIf he shops online, he will be forced to buy in bulk, he said, and his apartment cannot accommodate so many crickets.\\r\\n\u201cThis will make it a lot harder,\u201d Mr. Hernandez said. \u201cA lot.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-976253369,\"description\":\"Just days after the death of its owner, the New York-based pet store chain filed notices saying it may have to shutter dozens of stores and lay off workers.\\r\",\"title\":\"Petland Discounts, Whose \u201990s Jingle You\u2019re Humming Right Now, May Close\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"business.12.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Letitia James, the attorney general of New York, announced a settlement on Wednesday with Devumi, a company that sold hundreds of millions of fake followers on Twitter and other social media platforms before going out of business last year.\\r\\nThe settlement is one of the first major efforts by regulators and law enforcement officials to investigate the shadowy market of social media fraud, where armies of fake accounts are sold to businesses, politicians and celebrities seeking the appearance of influence.\\r\\nMs. James\u2019s investigation was prompted last year by a New York Times report that detailed how Devumi \u2014 then based in Florida \u2014 had earned millions of dollars peddling fake accounts to customers in New York and other states. Many of the accounts, known as bots, borrowed likenesses and personal details from real people, helping them avoid detection and deletion by Twitter.\\r\\nDevumi had at least 200,000 customers, including reality TV stars, professional athletes, comedians, models and pornographic actors, who bought anywhere from a few thousand to a few million fake followers to boost their online profile. Revelations about Devumi prompted Twitter to immediately block the company from accessing its systems, crippling the business.\\r\\nDevumi itself relied on fiction: The company advertised a New York office that did not exist, and Devumi\u2019s founder, German Calas, claimed degrees he had never actually earned.\\r\\nLast summer, Twitter, crediting The Times, stripped tens of millions of suspicious accounts from its users\u2019 follower counts, hoping to stamp out the sale of fakes.\\r\\nThe settlement was first reported by CNN.\\r\\n\u201cBots and other fake accounts have been running rampant on social media platforms, often stealing real people\u2019s identities to carry out fraud,\u201d Ms. James said in a statement. \u201cAs people and companies like Devumi continue to make a quick buck by lying to honest Americans, my office will continue to find and stop anyone who sells online deception.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Calas did not respond to an email seeking comment.\\r\\nWhether the settlement will have any immediate impact is unclear. Mr. Calas, who now lives in Colorado, dissolved his social media marketing companies last summer and fall amid negative publicity. In the agreement, signed last month, Mr. Calas did not admit or deny Ms. James\u2019s findings, and the settlement requires a relatively small fine of $50,000, intended to cover the cost of the inquiry.\\r\\nBut Ms. James\u2019s investigation could set the stage for further crackdowns on rampant consumer fraud and deceit on social media platforms, where so-called influencers \u2014 users with large followings \u2014 can earn a significant living selling endorsements and product placements.\\r\\nMs. James found that Devumi\u2019s sale of fake accounts and online engagement violated New York laws against fraud and false advertising.\\r\\nIn selling the appearance of social media influence, according to the settlement, Devumi misled both customers who believed they were buying real followers and members of the public whose thinking, such as deciding which candidates or policies were popular, could have been influenced by the fraud.\\r\\nThe attorney general also found that Devumi\u2019s sale of fake accounts using identifying details stolen from real people violated a New York statute that prohibits impersonating someone with an intent to obtain a benefit or defraud another person.\\r\\nHer findings come just months after California took action on the issue, approving a new law that will curb the deceptive use of bots.\\r\\nJonathan Albright, a researcher at Columbia University focusing on misinformation, described New York\u2019s case as a breakthrough in tackling social media fakery.\\r\\n\u201cIdeally, it will provide a template through which the bulk sale of online deception and false advertising can be prosecuted,\u201d he said.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1254265346,\"description\":\"The company, Devumi, was exposed as a leading wholesaler of fake Twitter followers in a New York Times investigation last year.\\r\",\"title\":\"Firm That Sold Social Media Bots Settles With New York Attorney General\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"technology.18.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Could competitive cyclists be putting their bone health at risk?\\r\\nA disquieting new study of bone density in elite cyclists and runners suggests that the answer might be yes. The study found that the cyclists, both male and female, had thinner bones than the runners, even though all of the athletes were young, healthy and enviably fit, and many of the cyclists lifted weights.\\r\\nThe results underscore the divergent effects of various sports on our skeletons and also stir a little unease about the long-term impacts of pursuing low-impact exercise at the expense of more high-impact activities.\\r\\nBy and large, the available scientific evidence shows that physical activity is desirable and even necessary for bone health. Children who run, hop and play develop thicker, stronger bones than those who remain sedentary, as do teenagers and young adults who participate in sports involving sprinting and leaping.\\r\\nMost scientists agree that these kinds of activities build skeletal strength by generating sudden, sharp forces that minutely bow or deform the affected bones. Such activities jump-start processes within the body that increase the number of bone cells and help to prepare those parts of the skeleton to withstand similar forces in the future.\\r\\nEven middle-aged and older people, who once were thought to face inevitable thinning of their bones with age, can maintain strong skeletons if they are sufficiently active, recent studies show.\\r\\nBut which types of exercise bend bones in a desirable way \u2014 and which are too gentle \u2014 remains uncertain. Some past studies suggest that running generates enough force to remodel bone, while other experiments with runners conclude the opposite. Ditto with weight training. And multiple studies have raised concerns about negligible or even adverse effects from non \u2014 weight-bearing exercises, such as cycling and swimming, which put little pressure on bones.\\r\\nIn hopes of gaining more clarity about sports and bones, researchers at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences and the Norwegian Olympic Training Center, in Oslo, decided to look closely at the skeletons of world-class, competitive cyclists and runners.\\r\\nThey focused on elite, full-time athletes in large part because the athletes\u2019 heavy training could be expected to amplify any impacts from and differences between the two sports.\\r\\nThey wound up recruiting 21 high-level runners and 19 road cyclists, men and women, most of them in their 20s and all of them lean, fit and with several years of intense competition behind them.\\r\\nThe athletes reported to a lab, where scientists measured their body composition, with particular focus on the density of their bones, both over all and in their lower spines and the tops of their femurs \u2014 portions of the skeleton that can indicate general bone health.\\r\\nThe researchers also asked the athletes about their training, health and calcium intake and whether they spent much time in the gym. The latter question was of particular interest to the researchers, since weight training often is recommended to athletes in sports like cycling to bulk up their bones, as well as their muscles.\\r\\nThe scientists then compared data. Some of the differences between athletes were substantial, if expected. The cyclists trained far more than the runners, for instance, averaging about 900 hours a year in the saddle, versus about 500 annual hours on the road or treadmills for the runners.\\r\\nThe cyclists also did more weight training, with most of them heading to the gym during their off-season for intense lifting. None of the runners did that.\\r\\nThe athletes in both sports consumed enough calcium to meet their expected daily requirements.\\r\\nBut they had noticeably different bones.\\r\\nThe cyclists, as a group, all had thinner bones than the runners, and more than half of them met medical criteria for low bone mineral density in some portion of their skeleton. One of the riders, a man, displayed clinical osteoporosis in his spine.\\r\\nThese results are potentially worrisome, says Oddbjorn Klomsten Andersen, a graduate student at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences and a former national-team cyclist himself, who led the study, which was published in BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine.\\r\\n\u201cThere are limited studies following young cyclists through their careers,\u201d he says. \u201cBut studies in master cyclists demonstrate that a larger proportion of them have low bone mineral density or osteoporosis\u201d than people who do not cycle.\\r\\nThis study cannot tell us, though, why cyclists\u2019 bones might be thin, he adds. They could have been eating too little or sweating too much for ideal bone health. Both low calorie intake and high rates of calcium loss through sweating have been tied to bone loss in other studies.\\r\\nMore surprising, the cyclists\u2019 heavy weight training seems not to have built much bone.\\r\\nBut, as Mr. Andersen points out, this was a one-time snapshot of the athletes\u2019 health. It\u2019s possible, he says, that weight training prevented even greater bone thinning.\\r\\nIt is also encouraging, he says, that the runners harbored relatively healthy bones, since some past studies have hinted that running might not stimulate bone building.\\r\\nOver all, the study\u2019s findings suggest that serious cyclists might want to consider at least sometimes branching out, Mr. Andersen says.\\r\\n\u201cI would generally recommend combining cycling with weight-bearing exercise to promote good bone health,\u201d he says.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1792994965,\"description\":\"Research has raised concerns that activities like cycling and swimming may put too little pressure on bones.\\r\",\"title\":\"Phys Ed: Can Low-Impact Sports Like Cycling Be Putting Your Bones at Risk?\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"health.19.txt\"}],\"labelMap\":[[-1470032073,\"technology\"],[1620813714,\"science\"],[391006090,\"world\"],[1668447843,\"technology\"],[-1492412555,\"business\"],[-1004715158,\"technology\"],[-727259249,\"technology\"],[1884837133,\"science\"],[-1501740769,\"technology\"],[-634690071,\"business\"],[1125083330,\"world\"],[1229292121,\"world\"],[411863084,\"technology\"],[-1361980079,\"world\"],[489669537,\"technology\"],[-1709632295,\"business\"],[326879815,\"science\"],[650611067,\"technology\"],[494067761,\"health\"],[1957449218,\"technology\"],[-582939649,\"technology\"],[-1116953762,\"health\"],[-1521949661,\"world\"],[-1309279343,\"world\"],[-1781385766,\"technology\"],[-1919147376,\"technology\"],[288498403,\"world\"],[254470884,\"technology\"],[1823608100,\"technology\"],[-583240374,\"technology\"],[2025704318,\"technology\"],[-96237933,\"world\"],[409830808,\"technology\"],[829092437,\"technology\"],[-957075741,\"world\"],[-1986019822,\"technology\"],[-990418623,\"world\"],[2064830945,\"technology\"],[-1418713501,\"science\"],[-1904714508,\"world\"],[-2030941738,\"business\"],[-1059350140,\"world\"],[-976253369,\"world\"],[1254265346,\"world\"],[1792994965,\"technology\"]],\"confusionMatrix\":[[0,0,0,4,3],[0,0,0,3,3],[1,0,0,4,2],[0,0,2,5,1],[2,0,1,2,4]],\"confusionLabels\":[\"business\",\"health\",\"science\",\"technology\",\"world\"],\"relabelingLabelMap\":[[-1781385766,\"technology\"],[-1309279343,\"world\"],[-1116953762,\"health\"],[-582939649,\"technology\"],[494067761,\"health\"],[650611067,\"technology\"],[326879815,\"science\"],[-1709632295,\"business\"],[489669537,\"world\"],[411863084,\"world\"],[1125083330,\"science\"],[-634690071,\"health\"],[-1501740769,\"technology\"],[-727259249,\"technology\"],[-1492412555,\"world\"],[1668447843,\"business\"],[1792994965,\"health\"],[-2122718852,\"health\"],[-164165755,\"health\"],[1028732566,\"health\"],[1705918815,\"health\"],[-1222156594,\"world\"]],\"accuracy\":0.3111111111111111,\"correctRelabeled\":[-582939649,494067761,326879815],\"labelingPrecision\":0.375,\"labelingRecall\":0.0967741935483871,\"correctAssignedItems\":[-1116953762,-582939649,494067761,326879815,-1709632295],\"assignmentPrecision\":0.375,\"openedItems\":[],\"numOpenedItems\":0,\"selectedItems\":[],\"selectedInCategory\":0,\"selectionRecall\":null},{\"modelOperation\":\"update\",\"changedFiles\":[{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"As the polar vortex bore down on the Midwest on Wednesday and Thursday, many residents heeded the warnings of officials to hunker down indoors and stay there. But that doesn\u2019t mean there was no fun to be had, inside or even outside (with proper layers, of course). \\r\\nWhile frigid temperatures set in, some took the opportunity to hone their soup-making skills and introduce their kids to beloved movies. Some even used their phones to, of all things, talk. Others went cross-country skiing or hiking, and one ventured outdoors just to freeze his pants (not the ones he was wearing). \\r\\nBelow, readers give their recommendations for the best ways to brave the elements, mostly from the safety of one\u2019s own home. They have been condensed and edited for clarity.\\r\\nPerform science experiments outside\\r\\nPolar Science Experiments: Ice bubbles! Recipe: 1\/2 cup Dawn dish detergent, 1\/4 cup corn syrup and 1 1\/2 cups water. After you make the mixture, chill it in the freezer. \\r\\nWe used a straw and found that a bubble suspended on the straw works better than one blown on the plate. Isaac and I enjoy science! \\r\\nBundle up and take a hike\\r\\nThis is winter. Take a hike. I went for a three-mile walk with my lab. He rolled in the snow, chased a squirrel, stood at the top of a hill facing the wind. He loved it and so did I. \\r\\nIf you don\u2019t get out, then cabin fever sets in. And winter is so quiet. How could you not want to stand in the woods and wonder at the beauty of it all? No bad weather, just bad clothes.\\r\\nHave a potluck with neighbors\\r\\nMy husband and I invited our neighbors over for a polar vortex potluck, and we ate and drank and talked till the wee hours! It definitely broke the monotony of the two of us staring at each other. \\r\\nInvite people over who live close by but that you might not know well. It will make the time fly by.\\r\\n\\r\\nFreeze your pants for a laugh\\r\\nFreeze some pants outside. It only takes a few minutes (you won\u2019t freeze) and it\u2019s just a silly thing to help make light of a seriously cold day.\\r\\nWatch a movie marathon \\r\\nThis is a perfect time to introduce my daughters \u2014 Lila, 10, and Mya, 7 \u2014 to the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d trilogy. There are movies I love that I want to introduce my daughters to, but we never seem to have long stretches of time to do this. Snow days are perfect for this. \\r\\nAlso, every time my kids complain about being bored, I make them put a toy in the Goodwill box. \u201cIf you\u2019re bored, that means you\u2019re tired of the toys we have, and it\u2019s time to get rid of them,\u201d I tell them. That stops the complaining and gets rid of stuff; it\u2019s a win-win. \\r\\nInvent new games\\r\\nInvent new games. We have one called \u201cWill She Poop on the Stoop?\u201d We bet if our dog, Zoey, will make it past the stoop to do her business. Five dollars says she\u2019ll poop on the stoop. \\r\\nThe result: Zoey just sort of stood there in terror, while we watched from a window to see if she would venture past the stoop. I\u2019m out five dollars so far. \\r\\nSpend more time on each pose\\r\\nWhile I know I should not rush through my yoga practice, I frequently do so I can move on to the next thing on my to-do list. Wednesday while marooned inside, I spent more time on each pose, conscious of breath and body throughout. The polar vortex turns out to be a teacher.\\r\\nTake a walk (in lots of layers)\\r\\nI just walked four blocks to get lunch at our bar, mostly to say I did it. I was wearing a wool union suit, long underwear, two shirts, a wool sweater, wool legwarmers, two pairs of wool socks, a long down coat, gloves, leather hunting mittens, a balaclava, a neck gaiter, a wool hat, a scarf and sunglasses to trap my breath and keep my eyeballs from freezing. It\u2019s sunny and beautiful out, so it was a cozy walk!\\r\\n\\r\\nUse the phone to \u2014 wait for it \u2014 talk \\r\\nThe weather is so bad that I am using the phone to actually have a conversation with friends. I\u2019m using a phone to talk. It\u2019s like junior high all over again, except instead of talking about junior high things, my friend and I had to confirm we had the same brand of Brazil nuts from Whole Foods, and whether or not the nuts smell funny. Adulthood.\\r\\nGo cross-country skiing\\r\\nI went cross-country skiing on Wednesday and got really warm. Just keeping yourself moving and having enough layers prevents the coldness. I\u2019m originally from Finland, and as a Finn I\u2019m just enjoying the real winter but amazed how poorly the coldness is handled here and sorry for those who are suffering because of it.\\r\\nNatural materials like wool are warmer than synthetic like fleece. Also, air between the clothes increases a warm feeling. You can wear two gloves or two hats at the same time, too. Drinking something hot during the day helps gives a nice warm feeling from inside.\\r\\nCook hot soup\\r\\nSoup-making! Work on some sweet knife skills, turn your stove on, get your house warm \u2014 and yummy, warm soup at the end of it!\\r\\nPlay cards and hit the gym\\r\\nRather than watching TV like we always do, my girlfriend and I played cards (Rummy 500). It\u2019s been a lovely way to avoid cabin fever.\\r\\nPrepare a warm dish and a mixed drink\\r\\nThis lemony chicken spring veggie soup has been soothing to make and comforting to eat when facing another day stranded inside.\\r\\nI\u2019m pairing it with a gin and tonic, while watching \u201cNarcos: Mexico\u201d on Netflix. Gotta make the best of it!\\r\\n\\r\\nChecking out the snowmobilers\\r\\nI had cabin fever Wednesday and went outside for a two-block walk (bundled up for it), and saw people still going into their usual routines. I dress in layers with long-sleeved fleece shirts, jeans or fleece-lined leggings, three pairs of socks, lined gloves, and I use hand and toe warmers in gloves and boots.\\r\\nI wanted to capture the natural beauty of the Northwoods in the midst of the polar vortex, and maybe see the snowmobilers (a trail runs behind my building on a lake) since that's normal this time of year \u2014 our town is known for year-round tourism and most of Chicago comes here to vacation. \\r\\nNorthern Wisconsin is used to living through this type of weather, but this is extreme even for here.\\r\\nMost of all, don\u2019t panic\\r\\nThere was some fairly impressive wind Tuesday night here near the southern shore of Lake Erie. I\u2019m able to work from home, so this polar vortex basically involves bundling up a bit, staying inside and waiting for warmer weather to return on Friday and Saturday. We had a similar but colder arctic blast a few years back that left me sitting in front of a fireplace in warm clothes, with a cup of tea and a book. \\r\\nIn short, don\u2019t panic, it will be over soon.\\r\\nA note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.\\r\\nFollow the @ReaderCenter on Twitter for more coverage highlighting your perspectives and experiences and for insight into how we work.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":489669537,\"description\":\"Our readers found novel ways to entertain themselves in weather so cold, even the mail was not delivered.\\r\",\"title\":\"It\u2019s Still Cold.

Fearful of havoc, they are stockpiling products, exploring new shipping routes and making backup plans, all the while having no idea how the adventure will end.\\r\\n\u201cWhat are we contending with?\u201d asks Filtermist\u2019s chief executive, James Stansfield. So long as he lacks an answer, his 50-year-old company will ship extra stock to Germany.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s meant extra resources, extra overtime, to get it done,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s stockpiling. It\u2019s incredibly annoying. It\u2019s frustrating.\u201d\\r\\nIt also threatens to be expensive. The British economy is 2.3 percent smaller than it would have been absent the June 2016 vote that set Brexit in motion, according to a recent estimate from the Center for European Reform, a pro-European research institution.\\r\\n[Investment in Britain\u2019s auto industry nearly halved in 2018 amid Brexit uncertainty.]\\r\\nThe main culprit is the uncertainty that has discouraged commerce. Investment in the British auto industry plunged by nearly half last year as companies waited to see how Brexit would play out, a leading trade association said this week.\\r\\nThat uncertainty is intensifying in the face of an epic stalemate. Parliament voted down an unpopular exit deal that Prime Minister Theresa May had negotiated with European leaders. Some lawmakers oppose Mrs. May\u2019s agreement because it takes Britain out of the European common marketplace; others because it ties Britain too closely to Europe.\\r\\nParliament may yet approve Mrs. May\u2019s deal \u2014 she survived a critical vote Tuesday that could have delayed Brexit \u2014 especially if the primary alternative is a tumultuous no-deal departure. Britain might extend the deadline, hold another referendum on the question of leaving the European Union or even call the whole thing off. But barring the emergence of a majority behind a negotiated arrangement, Britain will crash out.\\r\\nThat could profoundly alter the European single market, a free trade area running from Ireland to Greece. Customs checks would almost surely be revived at British and European ports, bringing paperwork, inspections and other bureaucratic elements not likely to speed up the transit of goods.\\r\\nMany companies that trade across the English Channel have been planning for a messy divorce while hoping to be pleasantly surprised by a smoother separation.\\r\\nMultinational banks now depend on rights within the European market that allow them to legally use offices in Britain to serve customers on the Continent. Brexit is likely to end that arrangement, so global banks have been shifting thousands of jobs from Britain to European banking centers.\\r\\nNovo Nordisk, a Danish pharmaceutical company, provides more than half the insulin used by British residents with diabetes. The company makes most of its insulin near Copenhagen, trucking the product to the French port of Calais, where ferries carry it to the English port of Dover.\\r\\nNormally, Novo Nordisk holds seven weeks\u2019 worth of stock at cold storage facilities in Britain. As the risk of a no-deal Brexit has risen, the company has increased that stockpile to a 16-week supply, said Pinder Sahota, the drugmaker\u2019s vice president for the United Kingdom. Novo Nordisk has booked airfreight shipments to ensure that it can get insulin to Britain even if sea lanes are disrupted.\\r\\n\u201cThis is one of the major logistical challenges that our industry has ever faced,\u201d Mr. Sahota said.\\r\\nSanofi, a French pharmaceutical company, has also stockpiled medicines while shifting the required quality-testing of batches of newly released drugs from Britain to the Republic of Ireland, a European Union member. That way, the company remains in compliance with European regulations.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s complicated and costly, and it\u2019s disruptive,\u201d said Hugo Fry, Sanofi\u2019s managing director for the United Kingdom.\\r\\nLast week, the chief executive at Airbus, the European commercial jet manufacturer, escalated fears that a no-deal Brexit could be a serious blow to the British economy, warning that it could force the company to shift the making of wings out of Britain.\\r\\n\u201cMake no mistake,\u201d said the chief executive, Tom Enders, in a video posted to YouTube. \u201cThere are plenty of countries out there who would love to build the wings for Airbus aircraft.\u201d\\r\\nJohn Nollett has grown weary of worrying about factors beyond his control. His company, Pressmark Pressings Ltd., makes auto parts at a factory in Atherstone, about 100 miles northwest of London. He and his partners bought the business in June 2016, closing on the purchase just a week after the Brexit referendum.\\r\\n\u201cWe thought, \u2018It can\u2019t be catastrophic. The government will be prepared,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s been a shambles, to be honest. There\u2019s still no clarity.\u201d\\r\\nRoughly one-third of the factory\u2019s 92 workers are from Eastern European countries, including Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Latvia \u2014 all members of the European Union. As long as Britain remains within Europe, they have the right to stay and work in Britain.\\r\\nBut what happens in a no-deal Brexit? Limiting immigration was a primary aspiration among those who voted to leave Europe. Mr. Nollett himself complains that \u201csome of the immigrants we\u2019ve had coming in don\u2019t fit with U.K. culture.\u201d If Brexit dislodges Eastern European workers, though, he frets that his labor costs could soar by as much as 30 percent.\\r\\nHe also worries about delays on the steel he imports from Belgium. The company makes parts for a supplier to a Nissan factory in northeast England. The supplier is obliged to deliver parts to Nissan every half-hour or face fines.\\r\\nPressmark has increased its reserves of steel by half to ensure that it has enough to last 15 days. The coils lie in a corner of the factory, on a grease-stained patch of concrete.\\r\\nThe company borrowed 200,000 pounds (about $263,000) to finance the additional steel. This, combined with a dip in British auto sales, prompted Mr. Nollett to delay buying newer presses.\\r\\n\u201cWhy would we want to invest in a plant if we are going to lose volume?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the uncertainty over Brexit.\u201d\\r\\nAt Filtermist, which employs about 90 people in Britain, Brexit has posed a distraction from the company\u2019s surging growth. Sales increased by nearly a third from 2017 to 2018, as factories around the world sought to protect workers from the hazards of industrial air. Filtermist automated part of its production and found jobs for the workers displaced by robots.\\r\\nMr. Stansfield, the chief executive, does not lack for other worries, among them an economic slowdown in China. But Brexit presents an especially acute danger: Manufacturers could leave Britain for industrial areas in Europe, especially in the key industries of aerospace and automotive. This was the point the Airbus chief brought home.\\r\\n\u201cHe voiced what many people were thinking,\u201d Mr. Stansfield said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to affect us.\u201d\\r\\nFiltermist is owned by a Swedish conglomerate. Mr. Stansfield has grown accustomed to phone calls from incredulous Swedish board members who assume that he, by dint of being English, must be able to divine the mysteries of Brexit.\\r\\n\u201cThey call us and ask, \u2018What\u2019s happening? What\u2019s going to happen?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we have to tell them, \u2018We don\u2019t know.\u2019\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":411863084,\"description\":\"A lack of clarity over the terms of Britain\u2019s looming departure from the European Union has British businesses stockpiling products and components, and delaying new investments.\\r\",\"title\":\"As Chances of No-Deal Brexit Rise, British Companies Scramble to Prepare\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"health.4.txt\"}],\"labelMap\":[[-1470032073,\"technology\"],[1620813714,\"science\"],[391006090,\"world\"],[1668447843,\"technology\"],[-1492412555,\"business\"],[-1004715158,\"technology\"],[-727259249,\"world\"],[1884837133,\"science\"],[-1501740769,\"technology\"],[-634690071,\"business\"],[1125083330,\"world\"],[1229292121,\"world\"],[411863084,\"world\"],[-1361980079,\"world\"],[489669537,\"world\"],[-1709632295,\"business\"],[326879815,\"science\"],[650611067,\"technology\"],[494067761,\"health\"],[1957449218,\"technology\"],[-582939649,\"technology\"],[-1116953762,\"health\"],[-1521949661,\"world\"],[-1309279343,\"world\"],[-1781385766,\"technology\"],[-1919147376,\"technology\"],[288498403,\"world\"],[254470884,\"technology\"],[1823608100,\"technology\"],[-583240374,\"technology\"],[2025704318,\"technology\"],[-96237933,\"world\"],[409830808,\"technology\"],[829092437,\"technology\"],[-957075741,\"world\"],[-1986019822,\"technology\"],[-990418623,\"world\"],[2064830945,\"technology\"],[-1418713501,\"world\"],[-1904714508,\"world\"],[-2030941738,\"business\"],[-1059350140,\"world\"],[-976253369,\"world\"],[1254265346,\"world\"],[1792994965,\"technology\"]],\"confusionMatrix\":[[0,0,0,4,3],[0,0,0,2,3],[1,0,0,3,2],[0,0,2,5,1],[2,0,0,1,6]],\"confusionLabels\":[\"business\",\"health\",\"science\",\"technology\",\"world\"],\"relabelingLabelMap\":[[-1781385766,\"technology\"],[-1309279343,\"world\"],[-1116953762,\"health\"],[-582939649,\"technology\"],[494067761,\"health\"],[650611067,\"technology\"],[326879815,\"science\"],[-1709632295,\"business\"],[489669537,\"world\"],[411863084,\"world\"],[1125083330,\"science\"],[-634690071,\"health\"],[-1501740769,\"technology\"],[-727259249,\"technology\"],[-1492412555,\"world\"],[1668447843,\"business\"],[1792994965,\"health\"],[-2122718852,\"health\"],[-164165755,\"health\"],[1028732566,\"health\"],[1705918815,\"health\"],[-1222156594,\"world\"]],\"accuracy\":0.35555555555555557,\"correctRelabeled\":[-582939649,494067761,326879815],\"labelingPrecision\":0.3,\"labelingRecall\":0.10344827586206896,\"correctAssignedItems\":[-1116953762,-582939649,494067761,326879815,-1709632295],\"assignmentPrecision\":0.3,\"openedItems\":[],\"numOpenedItems\":0,\"selectedItems\":[],\"selectedInCategory\":0,\"selectionRecall\":null},{\"modelOperation\":\"add\",\"changedFiles\":[{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Even in workplaces with a commitment to diversity, promotion decisions can leave women and people of color underrepresented at the upper ranks. \\r\\nA widely read article this week by Noam Scheiber and John Eligon shed light on that reality at the nation\u2019s elite law firms, where internal relationships can play a decisive role in career building. \\r\\nFocusing on the prominent firm Paul, Weiss, which recently announced an all-white partnership class, the article noted a broader pattern across big law: Diversity at the partner level is far less than among associates, or those starting law school, not to mention the general population.\\r\\nWe\u2019d like to know more about the challenges and career strategies of those who have worked as lawyers at large firms.

It\u2019s usually off-limits to patients, but maybe he knew I was a local doctor and faculty member at Harvard Medical School, which can occasionally get me a backstage pass. With a smirk, he told me I should eat something, pointing at the air in my stomach on the X-rays he had taken moments earlier.\\r\\nI\u2019d had surgery to remove three metastatic tumors from my lungs just hours before, and every breath ended with a wince. Food was not on my mind, but the tech had made me smile \u2014 air in the stomach usually signals that the patient needs to burp, not hunger. I began thinking about the potential for a case report in The New England Journal \u2014 34-year-old man with metastatic renal cell carcinoma needs a burp.\\r\\nBack in my hospital room, my mind went to the last time I found myself in a radiology reading room. It was Jan. 19, 2018, and I was looking at my own CT scan images late on a Friday afternoon, self-diagnosing the emotionally incomprehensible image before me as kidney cancer just minutes before my primary care doctor called back with the results. I called my brother and kept him on the phone with me for as long as I could, and still it was the most alone I have ever felt. My doctor told me that the radiologist said it was Stage 3, which meant that it could potentially be cured with surgical removal of my kidney. There were tiny nodules in my lungs, but they were too small to say anything definitive about.\\r\\nWithin a week, an all-star cast of renowned experts in renal uro-oncology had removed my left kidney. I was told that there was about a 50 percent chance this cancer would never return, and I wanted to believe that. I knew the numbers: five-year survival rates of Stage 4 or recurrent kidney cancer, in the lungs for example, are under 10 percent, though improving every year with new treatments. If only I could stay at Stage 3, maybe I could put this all behind me and live the life I had always planned with my wife watching our little boy grow up.\\r\\nIn recovery from my initial surgery, I shared a room with a man whose face I never saw but who seemed much sicker than I was. From the noises coming from behind the curtain, he seemed to be in a lot of discomfort, wandering in and out of consciousness. I was recovering from a freak illness, I told myself, but this man was very ill \u2014 a different kind of patient altogether. He couldn\u2019t tell that the blaring television was keeping me awake because most of the time he didn\u2019t seem to know what was going on around him. Eventually I was discharged and got some rest at home, but I still sometimes wonder how he had fared. \\r\\nIn the year since that initial operation and recovery, I\u2019ve begun to realize how much denial there was in my first assessment of that man. Refusing to believe that I might share his path may have been protective in the short term, letting me live this last year with love and laughter, work and play as though I could keep it up until my 90th birthday. \\r\\nBut my denial didn\u2019t do anything to prevent the anguish I felt when my cancer sprouted a new nodule in my right lung 10 months later. It didn\u2019t reduce the pain I felt finding out that those tiny nodules in my lungs at the time of diagnosis were cancer all along. Cancer patients usually attempt to maintain a positive attitude, and I appreciate how much better it is to do so than to be consumed by negativity, but no mind-set would have meaningfully muted the shock of my recurrence and the burden of having to tell my family that actually I\u2019ve been in Stage 4 all along. We just didn\u2019t know it.\\r\\nThis last year, I\u2019ve lived more fully than ever before in my life, holding my wife and son tighter and saying \u201cno\u201d more readily to work projects and other demands on my time that wouldn\u2019t enrich my life. I\u2019ve learned to let life\u2019s frustrations roll off me more casually, though the hospital parking garage still manages to make my blood boil. I\u2019ve made sure to tell my family and friends that I love them.\\r\\nNo one can tell me with any certainty about what lies ahead. Will I be ready for it? These questions circle in my mind on an ever-present loop without resolution. I know that I can\u2019t predict what comes next, but since my cancer recurred I have become committed to living in each moment and listening for clues about tomorrow.\\r\\nIn my recovery from last week\u2019s lung surgery, I again shared a room with someone further along in his illness than I. While I have no access to the details of his case, the somber tones used by his doctors behind the curtain were telling. His treatments were not working. His cancer was advancing, and a new plan had to be formed urgently. \\r\\nAs with my last hospital roommate, I never saw this man\u2019s face and we never spoke, but I feel immeasurably close to him, as though in some ways I know him better than my dearest friends. He heard me gasping for air through the night and yelping in pain as the chest tube got pulled, and I heard him trying to be brave for his family, reassuring them that they would go forward with whatever came next as best they could. I heard him speak in a reassuring voice to his children, only to hang up and weep loudly into the night until passing into a sleep from pure exhaustion.\\r\\nListening to him was like a kind of sonar, an echo bouncing back to me from my own future path, hinting at what\u2019s to come.\\r\\nWhen I was getting ready for discharge, I had the urge to pull the curtain and embrace him as he told me the secrets of what to expect next. I would ask how had he navigated the path from here to there. I would lay down the weight of uncertainty that surrounds my life and ask: What should I do now? How I can live with only a vague sense of dread of what\u2019s to come as my guide?\\r\\nBut he could not have given me answers, just as no one could have articulated what lay ahead for me at other junctures, such as when I started medical school, became a husband and a father or at the time of my diagnosis.

Mr. Modi\u2019s administration announced that, effective Feb. 1, foreign-owned e-commerce services like Amazon and Flipkart could not sell goods through affiliated companies. Direct sales to consumers had been banned earlier, but each of the two companies had set up a complex array of related companies to indirectly offer popular products at low prices with fast delivery.\\r\\nTo continue operating, Amazon and Walmart will now have to turn their sites in India into digital bazaars for independent merchants, becoming more like eBay, which charges for certain services but sells nothing itself.\\r\\n\u201cPeople have started to buy China\u2019s viewpoint: We need to build domestic assets and domestic companies,\u201d said Ankur Bisen, an analyst who leads the retail division at Technopak. \u201cWe have to have a more nuanced approach to the onslaught of global corporations.\u201d\\r\\nAshwani Mahajan, a leader of the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, an economic self-reliance organization affiliated with Mr. Modi\u2019s political party, praised the new policy, saying it was essential to help small shopkeepers survive against the economic might of global companies that can afford to offer deep discounts.\\r\\n\u201cI know my next-door shopkeeper,\u201d Mr. Mahajan said, echoing arguments heard in the United States when Walmart was battling Main Street retailers. \u201cI know his family. I don\u2019t know who is Amazon, who is Flipkart. For the survival of these two entities, I can\u2019t put the livelihood of my country at risk.\u201d\\r\\nSnapdeal, an Indian online marketplace that was hurt by earlier price wars with Amazon and Flipkart, also cheered the policy changes while urging the government not to grant the companies more time to comply.\\r\\nIndian consumers may pay a price for such protectionism. A survey of common products currently available on Amazon\u2019s Indian site suggests that after sales by its affiliated companies are banned, many products will disappear and others will become more expensive because they will only be sold by small merchants who lack the clout to negotiate low wholesale prices from manufacturers.\\r\\nThe policy changes prompted complaints from American business groups and diplomats, but the government has shown no sign of relenting.\\r\\nSenior officials of the commerce ministry, which issued the new rules, did not respond to several requests for comment. In recent days, they have been bombarded with thousands of emails and, in some cases, videos from small merchants urging them to take a tough line with the foreign companies.\\r\\nIn a letter sent on Wednesday, the main traders\u2019 organization threatened the government with political repercussions if it backtracked on the policy and urged officials to investigate the past two years\u2019 of transactions made by Amazon and Flipkart.\\r\\nMr. Bisen of Technopak predicted that the government would not enforce the rules aggressively for a few months, giving Amazon and Walmart time to figure out how to work within the new system.

But their respective responses to the cold were very different. On the American side, the governor of Michigan declared a state of emergency, the postal service stopped, schools, government offices, libraries, restaurants and businesses all closed.

But it was otherwise pretty much life as normal, even though the city isn\u2019t particularly well prepared for severe winter weather by Canadian standards.\\r\\nThe CBC Radio station  in Windsor spoke with Glenn Maleyko, who lives in suburban Windsor but crosses over to the Detroit suburb of Dearborn, where he is superintendent of the public school board.

Is there a reporter, photographer or editor you would like to get to know? Tell us in the comments section.\\r\\nMotoko Rich straddles two cultures as our Japanese-American Tokyo bureau chief. Landing the job almost three years ago meant returning to the country where her mother was born and where she had spent part of her childhood. \\r\\nA reporter for The Times since 2003, Motoko draws on her dual identity to bring nuance, empathy and \u201cfresh eyes\u201d to our coverage of Japan and the Koreas. Here, she discusses the challenges of interviewing Japanese people, her alternate dream job and how her two children help her see the world.\\r\\nWhat do you enjoy most about working in Japan? What is most challenging about it?\\r\\nJapan is a country where people keep their public and private selves completely distinct. They have words for both: \u201cTatemae\u201d refers to behavior or words used in public; \u201chon\u2019ne\u201d is the word for your true feelings. I think what I enjoy most \u2014 and what is most challenging \u2014 about working in Japan can be expressed by those two words. I really do relish that feeling of getting to know a source well enough that I feel like they are letting me in on \u201chon\u2019ne,\u201d but there are many times when I wonder if all I am getting is \u201ctatemae.\u201d\\r\\nHow has your background, as a half-Japanese woman who grew up in the United States and Japan, informed your work?\\r\\nI have written a little about this before. Because of my background, there is no question that my curiosity about Japanese society is personal as well as professional. I am driven to understand this place, and to help our readers understand it, in a nuanced, nonstereotyped way (no stories about anime-obsessed men marrying robots!).\\r\\nOne of the advantages of my background as a journalist is that I have always been an outsider wherever I am. That tends to put me in the observer\u2019s seat. Here in Japan, because of my American side, people don\u2019t assume that I know much about Japan and are willing to explain things to me (sometimes to an excessive degree). It also gives me the privilege of being able to question basic assumptions about Japanese society, while the Japanese side of my identity helps me understand why people here react in a way that might seem strange to someone who has no familiarity with Japanese culture.\\r\\nIf you had to choose another job, in journalism or not, what would it be?\\r\\nI definitely have a dream job now, but when I imagine another path it\u2019s writing novels for children. I would love to make kids feel the way that Katherine Paterson, Ellen Raskin, Judy Blume, Madeleine L\u2019Engle and Robert Newton Peck made me feel as an only child, when I found my best friends in their books. I read them obsessively and repeatedly.\\r\\nHow do you spend your time when you\u2019re off duty?\\r\\nWhen you\u2019re a foreign correspondent, you\u2019re technically never off duty! As often as possible, I try to make it home to family dinner (which my husband cooks, bless him), because I really want to hear what my kids have to say. Adolescents have a way of, shall we say, putting you in your place, but they can also deliver bolts of insight, and I want to be around as often as possible when those drop. Both of my kids play sports, so on weekends my husband and I can be found on the soccer sidelines or cheering someone on to a finish line. \\r\\nI love to bake (chocolate treats are a great antidote to stress), and in good weather we ride our bikes around Tokyo. If it were up to me, we would visit a lot more museums (and my husband and I occasionally do, if the kids are otherwise occupied \u2014 although the whole family enjoyed TeamLab Borderless). On the rare weekend when the kids aren\u2019t playing a game or running in a meet, we try to explore new hiking trails. \\r\\nWe probably watch a little too much streaming television: The family likes episodes of the Japanese reality show \u201cTerrace House,\u201d \u201cThe Good Place\u201d and \u201cAtlanta,\u201d while my daughter and I are currently working our way through \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d and \u201cThis Is Us.\u201d My son and I like to watch Trevor Noah on \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d \\r\\nAnd if I don\u2019t have a novel going at all times, I fall into a nagging funk (suggestions welcome). I intersperse the fiction with books of history, as I still have so much to learn about Japan and the Koreas. I am ever in search of a volume about Japan as good as \u201cEmbracing Defeat\u201d by John Dower.\\r\\nWhat\u2019s your favorite Japanese expression?\\r\\nI like \u201cyabai!\u201d right now.

Registry \u201cmay have been disclosed by an unauthorized person,\u201d the statement said. The ministry said it had filed a police report the next day and spent another two days working \u201cwith the relevant parties to disable access to the information.\u201d\\r\\nThough access was successfully disabled, the information \u201cis still in the possession of the unauthorized person, and could still be publicly disclosed in the future,\u201d the statement said. It named that person as Mikhy K. Farrera Brochez, an American citizen who it said had lived in Singapore on an employment pass from January 2008 to June 2016, when he was jailed. Mr. Brochez could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday.\\r\\nIn March 2017, the ministry said, Mr. Brochez was convicted of \u201cnumerous fraud and drug-related offenses\u201d and sentenced to 28 months in prison. The fraud offenses included lying to labor officials about his H.I.V. status, providing false information to the police and using forged degree certificates in job applications.\\r\\nMr. Brochez has since been deported, the ministry said, and \u201cremains outside Singapore,\u201d although it did not specify where.\\r\\nThe ministry said the illegally published records included names, identification numbers, contact details, H.I.V. test results and related medical information for 5,400 Singaporeans whose infections were diagnosed as recently as January 2013, and 8,800 foreigners diagnosed up to December 2011. They also included personal information for 2,400 people who had been identified through contact tracing, a procedure for minimizing the spread of a virus.\\r\\nThe disclosure of H.I.V. status is especially sensitive in Singapore, a conservative society where gay sex is banned under a British colonial-era law. According to the Ministry of Health, about 450 new cases of H.I.V. infection are reported in Singapore each year, half of which are transmitted through same-sex intercourse.\\r\\nThe attack is the second major data breach of Singapore\u2019s public health system since July, when a cyberattack compromised data from 1.5 million people, including Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, a cancer survivor. Singaporean officials said this month that the perpetrator in that attack \u201chad a clear goal in mind, namely the personal and outpatient medication data of the prime minister.\u201d The government has declined to name the perpetrator, citing national security.\\r\\nOn Monday evening, an official at the Health Ministry referred a reporter to the ministry\u2019s statement on the H.I.V. data breach and declined to comment further.\\r\\nThe Health Ministry said in its statement that \u201cthe authorities are seeking assistance from their foreign counterparts.\u201d But it was unclear as of Monday evening whether that included the United States.\\r\\nCamille Dawson, the counselor for public affairs at the United States Embassy in Singapore, said in an email that the embassy was unable to discuss the specifics of the case because of privacy laws. She added that it also could not comment on continuing investigations.\\r\\nThe Singaporean news media have previously identified Mr. Brochez as a psychologist and former lecturer at Temasek Polytechnic, a university in the city-state. He was reported to have tested positive for H.I.V. shortly after arriving in Singapore, which does not grant employment passes to foreigners with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.\\r\\nMr. Brochez\u2019s partner, Ler Teck Siang, is a Singaporean doctor and former head of the ministry\u2019s National Public Health Unit, which gave him access to the H.I.V. Registry. Prosecutors said that Dr. Ler twice submitted his own blood sample when Mr. Brochez was tested for H.I.V. so that Mr. Brochez could remain employed.\\r\\nDr. Ler resigned in January 2014 and was sentenced in November to 24 months in prison for abetting cheating and providing false information to the police and the Ministry of Health. He is appealing his conviction.\\r\\nIn addition, Dr. Ler has been charged with \u201cfailing to take reasonable care of confidential information regarding H.I.V.-positive patients,\u201d the ministry said.\\r\\nThe Health Ministry said that it had filed an initial police report in May 2016 after learning that Mr. Brochez might have been in possession of confidential information from the H.I.V. Registry. The police searched the properties of Dr. Ler and Mr. Brochez and seized records, and the people affected by the breach were notified.\\r\\nBut in May of last year, after Mr. Brochez had been deported, the ministry learned that he still had part of the data trove and filed a second police report.

Facebook also posted its full results for 2018, which showed its total revenue and profit reaching record levels.\\r\\nThe  results suggested that advertisers had continued to spend money on the site and that users were not deterred by Facebook\u2019s issues, which include the spreading of disinformation and election meddling. The company had said last year that it expected its growth to slow as it spent to improve the privacy and security of its users.\\r\\n\u201cOne of the biggest questions people have about Facebook is whether we can make the massive investments we\u2019re making to monitor and protect the platform while we keep growing our business,\u201d Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cThis quarter shows we can do both.\u201d\\r\\nYet even as its growth continued, Facebook began de-emphasizing its core social network and started highlighting its family of apps, which include Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. Facebook said it would eventually stop sharing user numbers for each individual service and instead provide one combined figure for all of its apps.\\r\\nThe change is part of a strategy by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, to knit together its businesses into one overarching network. Last week, The New York Times reported that he planned to integrate the technical infrastructure of WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger so that people could talk across the services for the first time. The move, which the company hopes to complete by the end of the year or by early 2020, could provide Facebook opportunities for additional revenue from messaging activity and would increase the utility of all of the apps.\\r\\nIn a call with investors on Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg confirmed the report, calling the move an eventual boon for users. People want messaging that is \u201cfast, private and reliable,\u201d he said.\\r\\nThe moves followed a difficult year for Facebook, as questions about the unintended consequences of social media have sharpened. The company has faced scrutiny over improper handling of its users\u2019 data, its largest-ever security breach last year, and the distribution of false content and foreign influence campaigns across its network.\\r\\nThis week, Facebook has been grappling with a report by TechCrunch that it paid people to install an app that would suck in all of their phone and web activity. That has renewed questions about Facebook\u2019s approach to user privacy and prompted criticism from Apple, which oversees iPhone apps.\\r\\nFor its fourth quarter, Facebook\u2019s revenue rose 30 percent from a year earlier to $16.9 billion, while profits jumped 61 percent to $6.9 billion. Seven million advertisers spend money on the platform, the company said, and in a shift, more than two million now buy ads in Facebook\u2019s Stories, one of its newer products.\\r\\nFacebook also said its daily active users had risen 9 percent from a year earlier to 1.52 billion, the same rate as in the previous quarter. Notably, the number of new users increased in every geography; in previous quarters, growth stagnated in the United States and in Europe. In total, Facebook said, 2.7 billion people now use its core social network and its other apps.\\r\\nThe company added that its estimate of fake accounts on its site had jumped 27 percent from the third quarter to 116 million, while duplicate accounts rose 12.5 percent to 255 million.\\r\\nThe overall results surpassed Wall Street estimates and sent shares of Facebook soaring more than 11 percent in after-hours trading. The company\u2019s share price had plunged about 34 percent over the past year, down from a high of $218 in July.\\r\\nFacebook also said it expected that other investments in new products in areas such as e-commerce and payments systems would yield new revenue streams.\\r\\nStill, executives cautioned on Wednesday that profit margins would begin to thin in the coming year. Facebook increased its number of employees to more than 35,000 in 2018, up 42 percent, as it added more people to fight disinformation and moderate content on the site. Operating expenses will keep rising, the company said, as Facebook hires in key areas to deal with the issues.\\r\\n\u201cA lot of our business challenges have been self-imposed,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said on the call.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":2059735833,\"description\":\"Despite a painful year of scandals, the social network reported Wednesday that it continued to grow in the fourth quarter.\\r\",\"title\":\"Facebook\u2019s Profits and Revenue Climb as It Gains More Users\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"technology.19.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Every Friday in the winter, if her clients don't have any pressing needs, Anne Sholley gets to leave work after lunch.\\r\\nWhile her friends are still slaving away in their offices, sometimes in the dark or during snowstorms, Ms. Sholley, the program director for Highview Creations, a company in New York that designs and installs green roofs, swims laps at the Metropolitan Recreation Center in Williamsburg or practices yoga at Shala Yoga House in Fort Greene. Sometimes she is in her car getting a head start for a ski weekend at Sugarbush Resort in Vermont or a relaxing getaway in the Catskills.\\r\\nWelcome to Winter Fridays.\\r\\nIn the last few years Summer Fridays have become common in certain sectors of the white-collar work force, like publishing and public relations, with professionals scurrying off from work early to get in a long weekend of sun and heat.\\r\\nNow others are doing the same in colder months.\\r\\nHighview Creations gives Friday afternoons off in winter in part because the company can\u2019t afford to in the summer. \u201cSummer is the most intensive time for landscape design, and we are putting in 50 to 60 hours of work a week,\u201d Ms. Sholley, 30, said. Employees can only hibernate when their plants do.\\r\\nBut other institutions are following suit to keep up morale in the most gloomy months, or, in the case of some Jewish nonprofits, for example, to honor religious practices. Because Shabbat starts at sunset, many observant employees need to get home by 3 or 4 p.m. in the winter. While it\u2019s a fun policy for non-Jews, it can also be kind of confusing. The Jewish Museum, for example, changes its Friday work hours every week by 15 minutes, based on when the sun sets.\\r\\nAt least one school is also experimenting with a shortened schedule.\\r\\nSix Fridays every winter, Kristin Koehler\u2019s 12-year-old son, Christopher, gets to leave his classroom at Robert C.

Those who don\u2019t want to ski can choose ice skating, swimming or cross-country lessons at nearby facilities.\\r\\n\u201cIt gives them a chance to take a risk and try something new,\u201d Ms. Koehler said.\\r\\nThe school planned the program, officially called Winter Fridays, to get kids outside during the darkest part of the year. \\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s dark and it\u2019s cold, so we have this little lift,\u201d said Laura Graceffa, the head of school at Robert C.

After examining more than 100 specimens of flying squirrels across two museum collections and spotting five more squirrels under UV light in the wild, the researchers and their colleagues reported surprising results last week in the Journal of Mammalogy: The pink is real.\\r\\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\\r\\nThree different species of flying squirrel \u2014 southern, northern and Humboldt\u2019s flying squirrel \u2014 turned that color under ultraviolet illumination. \\r\\nWhat the flying squirrels get out of it is still a mystery. Confirming that the squirrels are even capable of seeing in ultraviolet wavelengths will require additional study, Ms. Kohler said.\\r\\nWhile ultraviolet fluorescence in mammals has not been closely studied, it is not unheard-of in other parts of the animal kingdom. \\r\\nBirds and butterflies have many brilliant markings that are usually invisible to humans, who can\u2019t see ultraviolet wavelengths except under special lighting, but that are easily spotted by other members of their species. Fluorescence is common in the oceans, too.\\r\\nStudies have found that birds may use fluorescent markings when choosing a mate, and fish flash at other members of their species while darting through reefs. \\r\\nThe researchers have some hypotheses concerning what\u2019s behind the squirrels\u2019 Day-Glo displays. Ultraviolet rays are abundant during the dawn and dusk periods when the squirrels are moving around. So it is reasonable to expect that the fluorescence is visible to other organisms even when there are no biologists with UV flashlights in the vicinity.\\r\\nThe vivid pink color might have evolved to confuse the owls who prey on the squirrels. Those birds of prey fluoresce in precisely the same hue themselves; a flying squirrel may look, superficially at least, like a flying owl.\\r\\nOr, if it\u2019s confirmed that the squirrels see UV, the color might have something to do with mating or signaling to other flying squirrels.\\r\\n\u201cIt could also just be not ecologically significant to the species,\u201d Ms. Kohler said, noting that future work will delve into the question. \u201cIt could just be a cool color that they happen to produce.\u201d\\r\\n\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1125083330,\"description\":\"While ultraviolet fluorescence is common in birds, butterflies and sea creatures, scientists haven\u2019t often observed it in mammals.\\r\",\"title\":\"Trilobites: Flying Squirrels That Glow Pink in the Dark\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"science.0.txt\"}],\"labelMap\":[[-1470032073,\"technology\"],[1620813714,\"science\"],[391006090,\"world\"],[1668447843,\"technology\"],[-1492412555,\"business\"],[-1004715158,\"technology\"],[-727259249,\"world\"],[1884837133,\"science\"],[-1501740769,\"technology\"],[-634690071,\"business\"],[1125083330,\"science\"],[1229292121,\"world\"],[411863084,\"world\"],[-1361980079,\"world\"],[489669537,\"world\"],[-1709632295,\"business\"],[326879815,\"science\"],[650611067,\"technology\"],[494067761,\"health\"],[1957449218,\"technology\"],[-582939649,\"technology\"],[-1116953762,\"health\"],[-1521949661,\"world\"],[-1309279343,\"world\"],[-1781385766,\"technology\"],[-1919147376,\"technology\"],[288498403,\"world\"],[254470884,\"technology\"],[1823608100,\"technology\"],[-583240374,\"technology\"],[2025704318,\"technology\"],[-96237933,\"world\"],[409830808,\"technology\"],[829092437,\"technology\"],[-957075741,\"world\"],[-1986019822,\"technology\"],[-990418623,\"science\"],[2064830945,\"technology\"],[-1418713501,\"world\"],[-1904714508,\"world\"],[-2030941738,\"business\"],[-1059350140,\"world\"],[-976253369,\"world\"],[1254265346,\"world\"],[1792994965,\"technology\"],[65063940,\"world\"],[-2122718852,\"technology\"],[-1045290466,\"business\"],[1189967463,\"business\"],[-1070819612,\"business\"],[-1529928416,\"business\"],[2059735833,\"technology\"],[-373522571,\"world\"]],\"confusionMatrix\":[[0,0,0,4,5],[1,0,1,3,2],[1,0,0,3,1],[1,0,2,6,1],[4,0,0,1,6]],\"confusionLabels\":[\"business\",\"health\",\"science\",\"technology\",\"world\"],\"relabelingLabelMap\":[[-1781385766,\"technology\"],[-1309279343,\"world\"],[-1116953762,\"health\"],[-582939649,\"technology\"],[494067761,\"health\"],[650611067,\"technology\"],[326879815,\"science\"],[-1709632295,\"business\"],[489669537,\"world\"],[411863084,\"world\"],[1125083330,\"science\"],[-634690071,\"health\"],[-1501740769,\"technology\"],[-727259249,\"technology\"],[-1492412555,\"world\"],[1668447843,\"business\"],[1792994965,\"health\"],[-2122718852,\"health\"],[-164165755,\"health\"],[1028732566,\"health\"],[1705918815,\"health\"],[-1222156594,\"world\"]],\"accuracy\":0.33962264150943394,\"correctRelabeled\":[-582939649,494067761,326879815],\"labelingPrecision\":0.2727272727272727,\"labelingRecall\":0.08571428571428572,\"correctAssignedItems\":[-1116953762,-582939649,494067761,326879815,-1709632295,1125083330],\"assignmentPrecision\":0.2727272727272727,\"openedItems\":[],\"numOpenedItems\":0,\"selectedItems\":[],\"selectedInCategory\":0,\"selectionRecall\":null},{\"modelOperation\":\"add\",\"changedFiles\":[{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"CARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 Venezuela is on the brink. Grocery shelves lie empty as food becomes increasingly scarce and expensive. People are fleeing the country at record rates, flooding neighboring countries. Inflation is set to reach 10 million percent in 2019.\\r\\nIn this landscape of desperation, public outrage was already coming to a head when last week, Juan Guaid\u00f3, the opposition leader and head of the National Assembly, declared himself interim president. The recently re-elected President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has vowed to continue on. \\r\\nInternational attention swiftly turned to the two men at the center of the struggle for control of the country. But in the midst of the political push-and-pull, average Venezuelans are still struggling to get by in a country that has grown increasingly violent and where food shortages, electricity cuts and water shortages are the new normal. Deadly crackdowns on dissent are regular. \\r\\nAnti-government demonstrations are planned for Caracas on Saturday, and with discontent growing, new groups are taking to the streets, including those who were once staunch supporters of Mr. Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.\\r\\nWe asked residents of the city to describe what their living situation is like these days, and if it is a factor driving them to take part in the demonstrations. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWe are starving here.\u201d\\r\\nThe government benefits that Mrs. Donawa and her family have long relied on \u2014 like many of those from poor neighborhoods of Caracas \u2014 are no longer enough. \\r\\n\u201cWe are starving here,\u201d she said, describing how she and her son Dixon Bront are struggling to provide for her grandchildren. \u201cHe has a 9-year-old daughter and a 17-year-old boy, and he can\u2019t buy anything for them. This is becoming impossible.\u201d\\r\\nMrs. Donawa never voted for Mr. Maduro or Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, but her son was a supporter of the socialist government.\\r\\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if he voted for Ch\u00e1vez, but he sympathized with him,\u201d she said. \\r\\nMr. Bront and Mrs. Donawa are beneficiaries of several government programs like Misi\u00f3n Vivienda, which provides housing for the poor, and a food distribution program known as \u201cCLAP.\u201d \\r\\nBut Mrs. Donawa said the government food box is often limited to sugar, pasta and powdered milk. As benefits have deteriorated, Mr. Bront, once a supporter of the government, decided to join the protesters calling for its demise. \\r\\nTwo weeks ago, he was injured during demonstrations \u2014 shot in the stomach at close range by security forces \u2014 and is now bedridden after two surgeries, putting a further strain on the family.\\r\\n\u201cI can\u2019t be here in a hospital, sleeping in a chair,\u201d Mrs. Donawa said from her son\u2019s bedside. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I do not agree with him protesting, he is doing it like any other Venezuelan that is unhappy with this communist government.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer son has leukemia, but his hospital has no medicine.\\r\\n\u201cIt is like the world opens in half and you just want to jump into the crack,\u201d said Mrs. Cede\u00f1o, describing how she felt six years ago when she first found out her son, Miguel, had leukemia.\\r\\nThings were still manageable then. Her son was moved from a private hospital to the public Central Hospital of Venezuela where he was given medical treatment paid for by the state.\\r\\nHe went into remission for years, but in 2017, Miguel\u2019s cancer returned. That\u2019s when, Mrs. Cede\u00f1o said, everything changed. It was a race against time to get him proper treatment.\\r\\n\u201cI had to buy everything,\u201d she said. \u201cThe chemotherapy, the antibiotics, the needles. But now it\u2019s even worse. I have to buy gloves, cotton, alcohol, water, even the tubes for the lab if I need to ask for a blood test.\u201d\\r\\nVenezuela\u2019s main hospital has become a symbol of the catastrophic unraveling of the country\u2019s health care system. It is often without running water, medicine and even doctors. The electricity regularly cuts out, which has resulted in patient deaths, opposition politicians say. \\r\\nMrs. Cede\u00f1o said she has never been a fan of the protests, but her son has told her he is eager to attend them. \\r\\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Mom, I want to go out and make them feel the rage I feel everyday I am at this hospital without any help,\u2019\u201d she said.\\r\\n\u201cI have faith and hope.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Balza, 35, was a captain in the Venezuelan National Guard and quickly moved up the ranks, gaining the trust of officials who grew to rely on him, including Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Guerra, President Maduro\u2019s son. But he didn\u2019t always support the decisions of his superiors.\\r\\n\u201cI never agreed with their lines, ever,\u201d he said. \\r\\nTwo years ago, he fled Venezuela for the United States, where he now manages a company. Mr. Guaid\u00f3, as interim president, has proposed amnesty for members of the armed forces who are willing to break with Mr. Maduro\u2019s government, but Mr. Barza is unsure whether he will return.\\r\\n\u201cI worked from the inside against the government,\u201d Mr. Barza said, adding that he didn\u2019t necessarily think he needed to ask for amnesty. While he would like to get involved with some of the protests being held in the United States, he doesn\u2019t have time with his busy work schedule. But for the first time in years, he sees a way forward for his country. \\r\\n\u201cI have faith and hope,\u201d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was detained for 118 days in a windowless room. \\r\\nMrs. A\u00f1ez knows what the government\u2019s crackdown on dissent looks like. She was arrested in May 2017, accused of involvement with groups organizing daily anti-government protests. \\r\\n\u201cI gave them food, I offered them shelter,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is why they call me mam\u00e1.\u201d\\r\\nFor 118 days, she was held in a windowless room with another woman accused of gas smuggling. After the protests ended that year, Mrs. A\u00f1ez couldn\u2019t go back to her old life, saying being in jail had changed her. \\r\\n\u201cI can only tell you I am a better person now, and that I also knew true evil,\u201d she said. \\r\\nSince the latest round of protests began last month, Mrs. A\u00f1ez has scavenged for supplies for those wounded by the military and security forces. She has treated at least three protesters so far who were injured during recent demonstrations.\\r\\nMrs. A\u00f1ez said earlier protests in 2014 and 2017 were too violent and not effective.\\r\\n\u201cProtests have to be like the one we had on the 23rd,\u201d she said, referring to largely peaceful mass anti-government protests held the day Mr. Guaid\u00f3 swore himself in as interim president, \u201cthe kind that you can\u2019t hide.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI will be out there with my gas mask.\u201d\\r\\nBorn in Spain but raised in Venezuela, Mr. Zugasti has been active in the opposition protest movement since Mr. Maduro first came to power in 2013. He plans to join the large demonstrations planned this weekend. \\r\\n\u201cThis Saturday, I will be out there with my gas mask, my helmet and vest, to see what I can show the world,\u201d he said. \\r\\nMr. Zugasti owned a family printing company for two decades, which enabled him to provide for his family. But profits dwindled, and in 2018, he closed the business.\\r\\nHe said new people from different walks of life have been joining the recent protests. Before, he said, the movement was largely driven by the middle and upper classes.\\r\\n\u201cI used to see the same face every day, now it\u2019s different,\u201d he said.\\r\\nMr. Zugasti takes his camera with him when he protests, and took one especially memorable photo on April 4, 2017, of a young congressman confronting police who were blocking a march on Libertador Avenue.\\r\\nHe didn\u2019t know it then but the politician in the photo was Mr. Guaid\u00f3, who would become a major player in the country\u2019s current political standoff. \\r\\n\u201cEvery time I hear that he is someone that just started in politics, I know it\u2019s not true,\u201d Mr. Zugasti said. \u201cHe was always on the front line during protests.

Time for \u201cFrugal February,\u201d when splurging on restaurant meals is out and saving money by dining on home-cooked fare is in.\\r\\nA prime reason to observe Frugal February, personal finance experts say, is that consumers tend to overspend during the December holidays and need time for their finances to catch up.\\r\\nCasey Finn, a blogger in Chicago, said she and her husband, Michael, had adopted the tradition of belt-tightening in February several years ago, when they were engaged and worried about paying for a honeymoon trip. It worked so well \u2014 they saved a four-figure sum \u2014 that they kept it up and now share their penny-pinching activities online.\\r\\nFebruary works well for a financial reboot for many reasons, said Ms. Finn, one of the writers of the DIY Playbook. Because February has just 28 days, any feeling of deprivation is relatively short-lived. And it is, of course, quite cold in many parts of the country (it was a bone-chilling minus 24 degrees in Chicago on Wednesday), so people often prefer to stay home anyway.\\r\\nCutting back on nonessential spending in February can help people pay down credit card balances or replenish savings. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of not buying things we don\u2019t need,\u201d said Lynn Ballou, a certified financial planner and \u201cambassador\u201d for the Certified Financial Planners Board of Standards.\\r\\nCredit card debt has been mushrooming, and that trend continued in November, when revolving debt \u2014 mostly credit card debt \u2014 increased by 5.5 percent to $1.042 trillion, according to the latest data from the Federal Reserve. (Statistics for December are scheduled to be reported in February.)\\r\\nMany credit card users carry a balance on their cards from month to month, according to the American Bankers Association. That means they\u2019re probably paying double-digit interest rates: The average credit card rate is more than 14 percent, according to the website CompareCards, and the average rate for new card offers is nearly 17 percent.\\r\\nThe heavy use of credit during good economic times suggests that consumers aren\u2019t putting away extra cash to build up emergency funds for when things slow down, said Matt Schulz, chief industry analyst at CompareCards.\\r\\n\u201cAmericans need to focus on paying down their credit cards\u201d and other debt in 2019, he said.\\r\\nThe notion of cutting back on spending during the second month of the year has been around for a while. Now, the ability to share February savings strategies with others via social media can help engage people in the effort, said Kimberly Palmer, a personal finance expert with the website NerdWallet.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun, rather than a struggle,\u201d she said.\\r\\nMs. Finn said that while cutting back on nonessentials might sound dull, \u201cit\u2019s all about getting creative.\u201d Last year, the Winter Olympics were on television in February, so the couple watched at home and played games like \u201ccountertop curling,\u201d using ice cubes.\\r\\nMs. Finn and her husband enjoy meeting friends for drinks, but the cost of such outings can quickly add up. So in February, she said, instead of meeting a friend for a glass of wine after work, she may propose heading to a gym. They can catch up while burning calories instead of cash.\\r\\nThe month can also be a time to rediscover entertainment options in your home, Ms. Finn said, whether they are movies, books or board games. \u201cWe use the time to appreciate what we already have,\u201d she said.\\r\\nHere are some questions and answers about a post-holiday financial reboot:\\r\\nDoes transferring a credit card balance to a zero-rate card make sense?\\r\\nIf you have good credit, you can consider transferring your balance to a new card with an introductory zero percent interest offer and pay the bill off over time \u2014 sometimes, a year or longer. Look for a card with no or low transfer fees, and be sure you can pay off the balance in the allotted time. Otherwise, you\u2019ll end up paying stiff rates again, when the zero percent period ends.\\r\\nAnother option, if you have a record of on-time payments with your existing card, is to contact its issuer and see if you can negotiate a lower interest rate, said Bruce McClary, a spokesman for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling.\\r\\nNick Holeman, a certified financial planner with the online financial adviser Betterment, suggests considering the larger picture when paying off card debt. After paying at least the minimum amount due on your cards, he said, you should next contribute enough to your 401(k), if you have one, to get your employer\u2019s matching contribution, if offered. Then, he said, focus on paying off any high-interest debt \u2014 generally, anything over 6 percent, including remaining credit card debt.\\r\\nWhat\u2019s the best approach to paying down credit card debt?\\r\\nOne popular strategy is to pay off the card with the smallest balance first, to achieve results quickly and build momentum. Another approach, which Ms. Palmer of NerdWallet suggests, is paying off the cards with the highest interest rates first, since that saves the most money.\\r\\nWhat if I\u2019m planning to use my tax refund to pay down bills?\\r\\nTax refunds often provide a lump sum that consumers can use to pay down debt. This year, there\u2019s concern that refunds may be delayed as a result of the government shutdown, which ended just before tax-filing season. Mandi Matlock, a lawyer and tax expert affiliated with the National Consumer Law Center, cautions consumers against taking on new obligations or making big purchases until they have their refund in hand.\\r\\nSome for-profit tax preparers are promoting special loans to tide filers over, but be sure you understand the terms being offered, she warned. In some cases, the loans carry hefty interest rates, which will eat into your refund.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":511430857,\"description\":\"Cutting back on nonessential spending for a month can help people pay down credit card balances or put money in savings.

The Silicon Valley company defines fake accounts as profiles that are either designed to break its rules, for example by spammers or scammers impersonating others, or that are misclassified, such as someone setting up a Facebook profile instead of a Facebook page for a business.\\r\\nYet the number of Facebook accounts that fit those descriptions is less clear. While the company discloses its estimates of fake accounts, its figures have fluctuated and are confusing. Even Facebook admits its understanding of the numbers is tenuous. \\r\\n\u201cDuplicate and false accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale,\u201d it said in a securities filing in October, and the actual numbers \u201cmay vary significantly from our estimates.\u201d \\r\\nWith Facebook reporting a jump in the number of fake accounts on its site on Wednesday, let\u2019s dig into what figures it has given before \u2014 and why they don\u2019t necessarily add up. That has implications for the manipulation and abuse of the platform, as well as the company\u2019s business.\\r\\nA moving target \\r\\nFirst take a look at how Facebook\u2019s estimates for fake accounts, made in securities filings, have oscillated in recent years:\\r\\nWhat the table shows is that Facebook cut its estimate of fake accounts significantly in 2016. A year later, it more than quadrupled the estimate. And on Wednesday, in small print at the bottom of a slide about earnings, Facebook increased the estimate by 36 percent, to 116 million. So what\u2019s going on?\\r\\nFacebook arrives at its estimates by analyzing a sample of accounts, looking \u201cfor names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic,\u201d the company said in securities filings. \u201cWe apply significant judgment in making this determination.\u201d\\r\\nAlex Schultz, Facebook\u2019s vice president of analytics, said in an interview that its fake account estimates fluctuated in part because periodic attacks can cause spikes in the figures. He added that Facebook had grown in some emerging markets where fake accounts are more prevalent.\\r\\n\\r\\nA pile of new fakes\\r\\nFor years, investors, analysts and journalists had only Facebook\u2019s estimates to judge fake accounts. Last year, Facebook introduced a transparency page, which discloses how many fake accounts it has taken down each quarter. Those figures revealed that the scope was far larger than the estimates in securities filings had suggested.\\r\\nLet\u2019s run through the math on this in more detail. Facebook\u2019s new numbers added up to more than 2.8 billion fake accounts taken down in the 12 months that ended Sept. 30, or about 7.7 million a day.\\r\\nFacebook had previously reported that about 3 percent to 4 percent of its active users were fake. According to the new figures, the accounts taken down each quarter were equivalent to 25 percent to 35 percent of its active users (though those accounts were not counted in Facebook\u2019s active-user tallies because they had been removed).\\r\\nMore curious was how Facebook\u2019s estimate of active fake accounts barely budged even as the number of accounts it took down each quarter fluctuated widely. For instance, Facebook said it had caught 583 million fake accounts in the first quarter of 2018 and 800 million the next quarter. Yet between those two quarters, it told investors that its active fake accounts had increased by roughly one million. \\r\\nThose numbers suggest either that Facebook happens to be eliminating exactly enough accounts each quarter to keep its active fake-account estimate flat \u2014 or that its estimate is more like a guess.\\r\\n\u201cYou can use your judgment,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research who discovered last year that Facebook was claiming it could reach more people in the United States than the Census Bureau said lived in the country. \u201cI think there are reasons to be skeptical of the numbers they put forward.\u201d\\r\\nFacebook\u2019s figures also imply that over the past year, it has caught and taken down roughly 90 percent of fake accounts that are created on its site \u2014 most, it said, \u201cwithin minutes of registration.\u201d Facebook said it also stopped millions of fake accounts from registering each day. \\r\\nMr. Schultz said such a success rate was possible because \u201cthe vast majority of accounts we take down are from extremely na\u00efve adversaries,\u201d who typically create automated accounts that are easy to spot. The smaller number of fake accounts that elude detection are generally manually created accounts. \\r\\nMr. Schultz added that Facebook was cautious in removing manually created accounts because it didn\u2019t want to erase authentic profiles. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to over-enforce,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what we actually focus on is the harmful behavior.\u201d\\r\\nYet obvious fake accounts that are engaging in harmful behavior slip through. Last year, I found dozens of fake accounts masquerading as the company\u2019s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, to scam Facebook users out of cash. Some had been up for years.\\r\\nFacebook also said the vast majority of fake accounts it removed were ones that it had spotted, rather than ones that users had reported. Of the 2.8 billion fake accounts it took down in the year that ended Sept. 30, Facebook said, it found 99.3 percent on its own.\\r\\nThose numbers also contradict my experience. Last year, I easily created 11 Facebook accounts that used the same name, occupation and profile photo as my verified account. They remained live for five days, until I reported them to Facebook. Instagram, which Facebook owns, also left up 10 impostor accounts I had created until I reported them; it took down only five, until I alerted a Facebook spokesman. \\r\\nIf an account appears to be impersonating another user but isn\u2019t \u201cengaged in harmful behavior,\u201d Facebook often leaves it up, Mr. Schultz said. He said such duplicate accounts could be from people who had lost their password or were confused. \\r\\nDuplicate accounts add to confusion \\r\\nDuplicate accounts are banned under Facebook\u2019s rules. But they persist anyway, in even greater numbers than fake accounts, according to the company\u2019s estimates, compounding its problem of inauthentic activity.\\r\\nFacebook\u2019s estimates of duplicates have also seesawed, including nearly doubling in 2017. On Wednesday, Facebook increased its count by 20 percent, to 255 million. Take a look at the chart below.\\r\\nAaron Greenspan, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s Harvard University classmate who now tracks Facebook, issued a report last week questioning how many authentic users Facebook has. Mr. Greenspan, who started a site called \u201cthe Face Book\u201d while at Harvard and settled a trademark dispute with Facebook in 2009, said he believed the social network had far more fake accounts than it had disclosed, posing a grave risk to its business.\\r\\n\u201cThe fact there are so many unexplained differences and so many gaps, it paints a picture that, when you combine all these factors together, it would indicate there\u2019s something going on here that they\u2019re trying to hide,\u201d he said.\\r\\nMr. Schultz said Facebook was doing its best to police inauthentic accounts and be as transparent as possible about how many it believed were still on its site. \u201cWe disclose it very publicly, in my opinion,\u201d he said. \\r\\nWhen I asked him how advertisers felt about paying to show ads to fake accounts, Mr. Schultz said, \u201cWhat advertisers need to feel comfortable about are the actual results generated by our ad campaigns.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1502437256,\"description\":\"The social network has disclosed an estimate for years, but a closer look raises lots of questions.\\r\",\"title\":\"Does Facebook Really Know How Many Fake Accounts It Has?\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"technology.23.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"BEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Lebanon\u2019s newly formed government, which gives the Islamist movement Hezbollah key ministries, has raised concerns that the country could run afoul of sanctions by the United States that prohibit material support for the Iran-backed group.\\r\\nOn Friday, the United States warned Hezbollah against propping up its agenda with its new position, which includes key posts in Lebanon\u2019s government, including in the Ministry of Health.\\r\\nAmerican officials are concerned Hezbollah will use the ministry to provide state-subsidized health care and patronage jobs to its supporters and possibly even its fighters, helping it endure punishing American sanctions that have made it difficult for the group to offer its usual social services to its Shiite Muslim base.\\r\\n\u201cWe call on the new government to ensure the resources and services of these ministries do not provide support to Hezbollah,\u201d said a State Department spokesman, Robert Palladino.\\r\\nAs the new cabinet coalesced on Thursday after nearly nine months of political deadlock, the assistant United States Treasury secretary for terrorist financing, Marshall Billingslea, warned Hezbollah that if it tried to \u201cexploit these ministries to funnel money or undertake other activities in support of their terrorist agenda, then we will have significant concerns.\u201d\\r\\nHezbollah had been expected to gain strength in government after the group and its allies expanded their share of seats in Lebanon\u2019s parliamentary elections last May, significantly weakening the Western-backed prime minister, Saad Hariri, and his bloc. Now that it has won control of the Health Ministry, which has the fourth-largest budget in the government, its ability to embed itself in Lebanese state institutions has made it both a bigger target and a more elusive prey for the United States, which has designated it a terrorist group.\\r\\nLebanon\u2019s political system awards posts and patronage spoils to politicians of different religious affiliations in order to maintain a balance among the country\u2019s 18 officially recognized religious sects. There is a long history of ministers of all stripes using the Health Ministry to provide free or subsidized health care to supporters. Analysts believe Hezbollah may try to do the same, whether for its Shiite base or, more troublingly for the United States, for Hezbollah fighters wounded in the Syrian civil war next door.\\r\\n\u201cThis is yet another example of Hezbollah openly holding Lebanon\u2019s security and prosperity hostage,\u201d said Rachel Mikeska, a spokeswoman for the American Embassy in Lebanon. She added that the United States was \u201cprepared to take whatever actions are necessary to protect the interests of the Lebanese people.\u201d\\r\\nShe declined to say what those actions might be. But analysts said the possibilities ranged from the relatively restrained \u2014 such as reducing funding to the Health Ministry and squeezing other international donors, like the World Health Organization, to do the same \u2014 to the dire. The United States could theoretically impose sanctions on Lebanese hospitals, preventing the export of American medications to Lebanon, or cut off American military aid to the Lebanese Army.\\r\\nIt is unclear what Hezbollah might do at the Health Ministry that the Trump administration would consider a violation of the sanctions law President Trump signed in October. Analysts said Hezbollah may have chosen Dr. Jamil Jabak, a 63-year-old internist with close ties to Hezbollah, as health minister to try to avoid direct sanctions on the ministry. Dr. Jabak is not a member of Hezbollah, but is said to have once served as a personal physician to the group\u2019s leader.\\r\\n\u201cWould Washington consider free health care to Hezbollah members provided by the Health Ministry as an example of \u2018significant financial support?\u2019\u201d wrote Michael Young, a political observer and journalist with the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, in an opinion column last year. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say that it would never do so.\u201d\\r\\nThe United States\u2019 various interests in Lebanon often end up in conflict, including when it comes to Hezbollah: It wants to counter Iran and its proxies, but also maintain Lebanon\u2019s stability as the war in Syria continues to burn; it also wants to battle terrorism and push back on Russian influence in the Middle East.\\r\\nThough Washington has designated Hezbollah as a terrorist organization for its actions around the world and its close relationship to Iran, the group has also baked itself into legitimate parts of the Lebanese state, making it difficult for the United States to target it without also affecting the rest of the country.\\r\\n\u201cThe debate in the U.S. about Lebanon is always about which to prioritize and how to balance these competing priorities,\u201d said Firas Maksad, the director of the Arabia Foundation, a Washington-based think tank that leans toward pro-Saudi Arabia and anti-Iran policies.\\r\\nOn one side of the debate are anti-Iran hard-liners, who argue that \u201cthis is Iran on the Mediterranean, that Hezbollah uses the Lebanese political elite and the Lebanese government as a thin veil for political cover,\u201d Mr. Maksad said.\\r\\nThose voices, which include some Republicans in Congress and members of the Trump administration, may push for cutting off aid to the Lebanese Army \u2014 a significant source of support to the armed forces \u2014 as well as to the Health Ministry.\\r\\nOpposing these hawkish views are those, including much of the traditional foreign policy establishment, who prefer a more measured response.\\r\\nGiven Lebanon\u2019s floundering economy and political instability, Mr. Maksad said, \u201cthey don\u2019t want the whole place to come down.\u201d (The prospect of economic collapse greatly increased pressure on the country\u2019s political factions to strike a power-sharing agreement.)\\r\\nThey also argue that reducing military aid would leave room for Russia, which has expanded its influence across the Middle East, to make inroads in Lebanon.\\r\\nIn general, sanctions and financial tools have come to be the primary stick used by the United States against Iran and its regional partners. On a trip to Beirut last week, Mr. Billingslea urged Lebanese officials to exclude Hezbollah from involvement in the country\u2019s banking and financial sectors, and called for reforms that would allow the Lebanese authorities to block and freeze accounts associated with the group.\\r\\nBut as Hezbollah continues to expand its influence in Lebanese institutions, sanctions may prove to be an overly blunt tool, hitting legitimate government services and civilians in addition to the party.\\r\\nIn the past, when Hezbollah played a smaller role in government, \u201cyou could easily separate between Hezbollah and state institutions,\u201d said Hanin Ghaddar, a Lebanese-American analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and a frequent critic of Hezbollah.\\r\\nNow, with Hezbollah commanding a broad swath of government, she asked, \u201cHow do you keep the stability of Lebanese institutions while going after Hezbollah with everything you have?\u201d\\r\\nBut Kassem Qassir, a Lebanese political analyst close to Hezbollah, said the concerns about Hezbollah\u2019s dominance were overblown.\\r\\n\u201cNobody can have sole control over Lebanon, neither Hezbollah nor anybody else,\u201d he said. \u201cLebanon is a diverse country.\u201d\\r\\nIn a televised interview on Saturday, Hassan Nasrallah, the organization\u2019s secretary general, said the group did not intend to meddle with Lebanon\u2019s balance of power.\\r\\nBut Mr. Maksad noted that Hezbollah had managed to forge pacts with Christian and Sunni politicians as well as Shiite ones, then held up the formation of the new government until the prime minister, a Sunni, agreed to allow Hezbollah\u2019s Sunni allies into the cabinet \u2014 an unmistakable mark of its strength.\\r\\nOf the new faces in the 30-seat cabinet, it was Dr. Jabak, the physician leading a ministry closely watched by the West, who attracted the most immediate attention.\\r\\n\u201cI don\u2019t belong to any political party,\u201d he said in a radio interview on Friday.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-825453762,\"description\":\"The Iran-backed group Hezbollah and its allies took key posts in Lebanon\u2019s new cabinet, raising concerns that American sanctions could entangle state services for an already struggling nation.\\r\",\"title\":\"As Hezbollah Rises in Lebanon\u2019s Government, Fears About U.S. Response Follow\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"world.11.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Emily Bazelon, a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.\\r\\nWhat are the most important tools that you, as a magazine writer who does investigative reporting, rely on? \\r\\nHonestly, the vital tool in my work is people\u2019s willingness to trust me with their stories and to patiently explain to me what I don\u2019t understand. That\u2019s what I need to do my job. \\r\\nEverything is a means to that end. Talking to people face to face is still the best, and when I can\u2019t meet someone in person, Skype is my substitute. When I Skype from my laptop, it looks like I\u2019m calling from my cellphone number. I use a software addition called Call Recorder to tape calls (after asking people\u2019s permission). It pops up when the call begins, which makes me remember to hit the button, and then it saves the calls in Ecamm Movie Tools. From there, it\u2019s easy to export the files and play them.\\r\\nWhen I say easy, I mean it, because when a tech tool isn\u2019t easy to use to the point of being self-explanatory, I can\u2019t get myself to use it. I don\u2019t say that with pride. It\u2019s a handicap to be bad at solving tech-related problems. But when I can\u2019t figure something out quickly, I don\u2019t think, \u201cHmm, this is an interesting puzzle \u2014 how can I solve it?\u201d I just get frustrated and mad. \\r\\nAnother tool I rely on is my Zoom H1n digital voice recorder. It\u2019s light and hand-held, and it doesn\u2019t obviously look like a tape recorder. It even comes in a little case that looks as if it could be for eyeglasses. The sound quality is good, especially for its size.\\r\\nI do think the design could be updated: For example, you need an old USB cable to export files onto your laptop, and then I have trouble remembering how to find them.\\r\\nOne more tool: Freedom of Information Act requests. The state and federal laws that allow citizens to request information from the government are a great friend. (There\u2019s a caveat: Some agencies take a long time to respond, so if you\u2019re on a tight deadline, you may be stonewalled.) \\r\\nI\u2019ve done investigative projects based on a relatively small number of documents, but if I ever have to sift through a huge data dump, looking for patterns and smoking guns, I\u2019ll use a software program called Everlaw. It lets you browse quickly without worrying about what format a document is in. (For example, you can switch back and forth between text messages and a PowerPoint.) I like the options it offers for organizing material. Full disclosure: My nephew Zach Sabin is a software engineer who helped develop this product.\\r\\nYou are also a co-host of Slate\u2019s Political Gabfest podcast. What does your podcast setup look like? \\r\\nWhen David Plotz, John Dickerson and I started taping the Gabfest more than a dozen years ago, we worked together in an office in Washington and sat down in a studio there and just talked into microphones. \\r\\nThen I moved to New Haven. For a while, I used a tie-line box, which is a kind of magical connection I won\u2019t try to explain. Later, I switched to an app for my iPhone called Report-IT Enterprise Edition. This one is dummy proof. It has a Report Live feature, which connects you in much the way the tie-line does, or so it seems to me. \\r\\nReport-IT also offers Record a Report. For this option, you place a regular telephone call and then tape yourself talking into your iPhone. When the call is done, you upload it and send it off to some server in the sky.\\r\\nI have screwed up Report-IT only once, and that was because I forgot to turn it on. Last year, though, it stopped working because of a security firewall in Slate\u2019s Washington office. So I started taping at the Yale Broadcast Studio, where the engineers are super nice and competent and all I have to do is stay on mic.\\r\\nAs a pretty active Twitter user, you get a fair amount of feedback from readers, good and bad. What\u2019s your advice for dealing with the hate?\u00a0\\r\\nMy advice is to be thick skinned about hate but open to thoughtful criticism. \\r\\nOf course, I don\u2019t always take my own advice. \\r\\nLast summer, I wrote an essay for The Times Magazine about the term \u201cwhite people,\u201d which launched a thousand neo-Nazi trolls in my Twitter timeline. Actually, I have no way of knowing if there were a thousand trolls or five trolls and 995 bots, but lots and lots of accounts were tweeting anti-Semitic garbage at me. Other Jewish journalists have experienced this to a greater degree than I did, and journalists of color regularly have it much worse, as do women who write about misogyny. I didn\u2019t enjoy my turn at being trolled, but I feel defiantly attached to my essay.\\r\\nThe danger of hateful feedback (in addition to the possibility of actual danger) is that to repel it, you risk numbing yourself to constructive criticism. I try to deal with this by giving myself a little time, after I publish a story, before I look at emails from readers or comments online. With distance, I can process criticism and funnel it into making my work better. \\r\\nI have a book coming out in April, and I am really going to have to remember this when it comes out.\\r\\nOutside of work, what tech product are you and your family using a lot?\\r\\nPity my children. Five years ago, when they were in elementary school and middle school, I published a book about bullying in which my basic advice to parents about technology was to delay access to it. Especially smartphones. \\r\\nMy sons got flip phones in seventh grade and iPhones in ninth grade (the older one) and eighth grade (the younger one). They would tell you that they missed out on certain social interactions, especially group texting, because their parents were dogmatic. (Also, in my own case, hypocritical \u2014 I have trouble unplugging.) \\r\\nI will say, though, that I still think setting limits is crucial. I like the mantra \u201cPeople sleep upstairs. Phones sleep downstairs.\u201d\\r\\nThese days, my family bonds more over my tech ineptitude than any tech product. (It would be better if the gender dynamics in this story were reversed, but so it goes.) In particular, I\u2019m mocked for not being able to turn on the television. There are four remote controls, with cryptic prompts for activating four different boxes. I can\u2019t keep it all straight. I get to pick the shows sometimes, though.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1425051396,\"description\":\"Emily Bazelon, an investigative reporter at The New York Times Magazine, craves easy-to-use tools, whether for interviews, Freedom of Information Act records or her home TV.\\r\",\"title\":\"Tech We\u2019re Using: An Arsenal of Skype, Voice Recorders and FOIAs\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"technology.22.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"When Ronald Braunstein conducts an orchestra, there\u2019s no sign of his bipolar disorder. He\u2019s confident and happy.\\r\\nMusic isn\u2019t his only medicine, but its healing power is potent. Scientific research has shown that music helps fight depression, lower blood pressure and reduce pain.\\r\\nThe National Institutes of Health has a partnership with the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts called Sound Health: Music and the Mind, to expand on the links between music and mental health. It explores how listening to, performing or creating music involves brain circuitry that can be harnessed to improve health and well-being.\\r\\nDr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said: \u201cWe\u2019re bringing neuroscientists together with musicians to speak each other\u2019s language. Mental health conditions are among those areas we\u2019d like to see studied.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Braunstein, 63, has experienced the benefits of music for his own mental health and set out to bring them to others by founding orchestras in which the performers are all people affected by mental illness.\\r\\nUpon graduating from the Juilliard School in his early 20s, he entered a summer program at the Salzburg Mozarteum in Austria, and in 1979 became the first American to win the prestigious Karajan International Conducting Competition in Berlin. \\r\\nHis career took off. He worked with orchestras in Europe, Israel, Australia and Tokyo. At the time, he didn\u2019t have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder.\\r\\nBut looking back, he can see that his disorder contributed to his success, and his talent masked the condition.\\r\\n\u201cThe unbelievable mania I experienced helped me win the Karajan,\u201d he said. \u201cI learned repertoire fast. I studied through the night and wouldn\u2019t sleep. I didn\u2019t eat because if I did, it would take away my edge.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cMy bipolar disorder was just under the line of being under control,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easily detected. Most people thought I was weird.\u201d\\r\\nHe always sensed something was askew. When he was 15, his father took him to a doctor who diagnosed \u201cbad nerves\u201d and prescribed Valium.\\r\\nAs his career progressed, things started to unravel, and his behavior grew increasingly erratic. He was given a diagnosis of bipolar disorder at age 35. His manager dropped him as a client, and he was fired from a conducting job in Vermont.\\r\\nIt was there he met Caroline Whiddon, who had been the chairwoman of the Youth Orchestra Division of the League of American Orchestras. She had been given a diagnosis of depression and anxiety disorder more than 20 years earlier, and had played French horn professionally, which she described as \u201ca notorious instrument that\u2019s known for breaking people.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nMr. Braunstein reached out to her about creating an orchestra that welcomed musicians with mental illnesses and family members and friends who support them. \\r\\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d go back to playing French horn again,\u201d she said. \u201cRonald gave me back the gift of music.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Braunstein called his new venture the Me2\/Orchestra, because when he told other musicians about his mental health diagnosis, they\u2019d often respond, \u201cMe too.\u201d\\r\\nSince the term #MeToo is now associated with sexual assault cases, people sometimes ask if the orchestra is connected to that cause. \u201cIt gives us an opportunity to explain that we were founded in 2011,\u201d in Burlington, Vt., \u201cbefore the Me Too movement began,\u201d Ms. Whiddon said.\\r\\nIn 2014, a second orchestra, Me2\/Boston, was created. In between, in 2013, Mr. Braunstein and Ms. Whiddon got married.\\r\\nEach orchestra performs between six and eight times a year. Each has about 50 musicians, both amateur and professional, ranging in age from 13 to over 80, and they rehearse once a week. New affiliate ensembles in Portland, Ore., and Atlanta follow similar schedules.\\r\\nMr. Braunstein gives free private lessons to those who want to polish their skills.\\r\\nMe2\/Orchestra is a nonprofit, and the musicians are all volunteers. Ms. Whiddon raises money through an annual letter-writing campaign to cover expenses, with support from more than 100 donors.\\r\\n\u201cWhen we perform at a hospital, center for the homeless or correctional facility,\u201d Ms. Whiddon said, \u201cthe cost of that performance is covered by corporate sponsorships, grants or donations from individuals, so the performance is free to those who attend.\u201d\\r\\nParticipating in Me2\/Boston allowed Nancy-Lee Mauger, age 55, to pick up the French horn again. The note on the rehearsal door \u2014 \u201cThis is a stigma-free zone\u201d \u2014 made her feel welcome.\\r\\nMs. Mauger had played French horn until her mental illness made it impossible to perform. She has diagnoses of dissociative identity disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.\\r\\n\u201cIn 2009, I was playing a Christmas Eve gig,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was at the same church, with the same quintet, choir and music that I had played every Christmas Eve for 15 years. This particular night felt different. I had trouble focusing my eyes. At one point, I could not read music or play my horn.\u201d\\r\\nIt lasted about two minutes, and she thought she was having a stroke. In fact, it was her mental illness.\\r\\n\u201cI learned that little parts of me would come out and try to play my horn during gigs,\u201d she said. \u201cThe problem was that they didn\u2019t know how to play. This became such an obvious problem that I quit.\u201d\\r\\nNow, after four years of intensive therapy, she is able to play again.\\r\\nAt each performance, a few musicians briefly talk about their mental illnesses and take questions from the audience. \u201cInstead of thinking people with mental illnesses are lazy or dangerous, they see what we\u2019re capable of,\u201d Mr. Braunstein said. \u201cIt has a positive effect on all of us.\u201d\\r\\nJessica Stuart, now 34, stopped playing violin in her mid-20s when she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. \u201cJoining the Me2\/Orchestra in Boston in 2014 was the first time I had played in years,\u201d she said. \u201cI cannot count the ways the orchestra helps me. It has allowed me to overcome the shame I felt about living with mental illness. I no longer feel I have to hide an important part of my life from the rest of the world.\u201d\\r\\nJessie Bodell, a 26-year-old flute player who has borderline personality disorder, said he finds rehearsals fun, relaxed and democratic.\\r\\nHe noted that unlike most orchestras, Me2 doesn\u2019t have first, second or third positions. \u201cThere isn\u2019t an underlying, tense, competitive feeling here,\u201d he said.\\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen when you sing or play an instrument, it doesn\u2019t just activate one part of your brain,\u201d said Dr. Collins of the National Institutes of Health. \u201cA whole constellation of brain areas becomes active. Our response to music is separate from other interventions such as asking people to recall memories or listen to another language.\u201d\\r\\nPartnering with Dr. Collins on Sound Health is Ren\u00e9e Fleming, the renowned soprano and artistic adviser to the Kennedy Center. \u201cThe first goal is to move music therapy forward as a discipline,\u201d she said. \u201cThe second is to educate the public and enlighten people about the power of music to heal.\u201d\\r\\nSo far the initiative is investigating how music could help Parkinson\u2019s patients walk with a steady gait, help stroke survivors regain the ability to speak, and give cancer patients relief from chronic pain.\\r\\n\u201cThe payoff,\u201d Dr. Collins said, is to \u201cimprove mental health. We know music shares brain areas with movement, memory, motivation and reward. These things are hugely important to mental health, and researchers are trying to use this same concept of an alternate pathway to address new categories of mental disorders.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1250615417,\"description\":\"An orchestra in which musicians are dealing with mental health issues is working to harness the healing power of music.\\r\",\"title\":\"Fighting the Stigma of Mental Illness Through Music\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"health.31.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"This is Choire Sicha\u2019s final column as your Work Friend.

Yes. That\u2019s right. Your boss is an alcoholic. \\r\\nWhat if Work Was Just a Job?\\r\\nI\u2019m about a year in at a new job that I\u2019m very proud to have. I love the work I do, I\u2019m happy enough with the pay and I feel respected. One big problem, though: I do not relate socially to anyone in my office. I\u2019ve definitely tried \u2014 I send the occasional joke over Gchat, I ask how people\u2019s weekends were when I run into them in the kitchen, all that, but I get nothing back. It permeates the office culture. It seems that no one here really socially interacts with each other. \\r\\nI work long hours, and I\u2019m a fairly extroverted person, so I\u2019m thinking that the company culture just might not be right for me. I don\u2019t need much, but I do know the occasional banter\/dish about my weekend would help me feel a lot happier. A lot of it has to do with a pretty significant age gap. However, the lack of social interaction makes me pine to leave the office, thus I feel burned-out often, and that burnout has led to me tending toward laziness sometimes. Is this enough for me to consider leaving an otherwise great gig?\\r\\n\u2014 New York City\\r\\nI think you\u2019re having too many cascading experiences about this workplace, when instead you should be having cascading experiences of trauma over the fact that you are scouring the ocean bare of life with your daily existence.

There\u2019s an album by The Promise Ring called \u201cNothing Feels Good.\u201d It\u2019s an emo record.\\r\\nSo I\u2019m going to risk sentimentality here and say that there were places on the internet about 10 years ago that were exciting for me. These were lively communities based around art and experimental literature, variously called websites, magazines and blogs.\\r\\nBut I can no longer identify any exciting internet magazines; they all feel very antiseptic. This relates to work, because people read internet magazines at work, and because some people work for internet magazines. How did we get here? Pardon my emotion.\\r\\n\u2014 Minneapolis\\r\\nI\u2019m listening to \u201cNothing Feels Good\u201d right now for the first time and I absolutely hate it!\\r\\nHow did we get to this place where \u201ccontent\u201d that solicits you to consume it feels invasive, manipulative or basic?

Also, many of them have gone all the way to the television, a.k.a. \u201cthe little screen.\u201d From Julie Klausner and Julieanne Smolinski to Megan Amram and Cord Jefferson and Emma Carmichael, and yes also Diablo Cody before them: Never forget, a number of the internet\u2019s most beautiful basket cases now make the fine television that you enjoy upon your streaming service of choice. \\r\\nNow, otherwise, instead of reading, people gaze upon the many pictures of the duckfaces. Think about how mournful this generation will feel in a decade for what they will inevitably lose too, when the next crop of young people express themselves with \u2014 electric shocks? Mutilation? Who knows. \\r\\nNostalgia, however, is a very rainbow-tinted set of glasses. I recently briefly got my hands on a collection of \u201c7 Days,\u201d the fabled magazine edited by the legendary, just-retired Adam Moss that folded in 1990. It was fascinating and intriguing as a time capsule and a product. Also, lots of it was not really all that interesting. \\r\\nSooner or later, it\u2019s all destined for the bird cage. But all these publications that rose and fell, at least they gave some people some jobs for a while. Speaking of! If you\u2019ve enjoyed your time at all here in this first three-month installment of Work Friend, please tip your server by subscribing to The New York Times. \\r\\nChoire Sicha, the Styles editor of The Times, is no longer your Work Friend. Next quarter in this space: Katy Lederer, a poet, veteran of a quantitative hedge fund, and author of the memoir \u201cPoker Face: A Girlhood Among Gamblers.\u201d Write to her at workfriend@nytimes.com.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-324448097,\"description\":\"Before we go, at least there\u2019ll be work.\\r\",\"title\":\"Work Friend: Everyone Dies\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"business.17.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"I had hoped to avoid ushering in the new year with yet another weight\/diet column, but three circumstances prompted me to reconsider:\\r\\n1) The latest data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that the weight of American men and women has continued its upward climb, with the average B.M.I. now almost at the cutoff for obesity; \\r\\n2) The Food and Drug Administration is rolling out changes in serving sizes on packaged foods that could very well make matters worse, especially for consumers of ice cream and soda, and\\r\\n3) Some good news for a change: the publication of an eminently sensible approach to weight loss, \u201cFinally Full, Finally Slim,\u201d written by a leading expert on portion control, Lisa R. Young, a registered dietitian and adjunct professor of nutrition at New York University.\\r\\nUnlike the myriad diet fads that have yet to stem the ever-increasing girth of American men and women, what Dr. Young describes is not a diet but a practical approach to food and eating that can be adapted to almost any way of life, even if most meals are eaten out or taken out. It is not prescriptive or even proscriptive. It does not cut out any category of food, like carbohydrates or fats, nor does it deprive people of their favorite foods, including sweet treats.\\r\\nAnd it works. I know, because more than half a century ago I lost 40 pounds in two years following Dr. Young\u2019s approach, and I\u2019ve kept the weight off ever since without dieting or deprivation. It fills me up with delicious, nutritious foods and allows me to enjoy a frequent nightcap of ice cream \u2014 half a cup (measured) at 150 calories or less.\\r\\nDr. Young\u2019s emphasis is less on what you eat and more on how much you eat of any food, including those considered healthful. Which is one reason I worry about potential damage from the mandated changes in serving sizes now being phased in, which could encourage those aiming to stick with a single serving to overeat.\\r\\nFor better or worse, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 requires that serving sizes listed on Nutrition Facts labels reflect current eating habits \u2014 how much people actually eat as opposed to how much they should eat. And since Americans now consume considerably more of most foods than they did three decades ago, the serving sizes on food labels will increase accordingly.\\r\\nAs a result, a serving of ice cream, for example, which for many decades has been listed as one-half cup, has now grown to two-thirds of a cup. And a serving of soda, long 8 ounces, is now 12 ounces. And a packaged food usually consumed at one sitting, including a 20-ounce soda, is also considered one serving.\\r\\nThe good news is that the calories in that serving now appear in large bold type on the label, so that if people consider how many calories they would be consuming, they won\u2019t be hoodwinked. (Another virtue of the new labels is the separate listing of \u201cadded sugars,\u201d distinguishing these commercially introduced sweeteners from sugars that occur naturally in foods like milk and fruits.)\\r\\nBut back to portions. If you\u2019re serious about losing or maintaining weight, you\u2019d be wise to learn the size of a healthful portion of various categories of foods and treat what is typically served in restaurants to individual diners as servings for two or more. My \u201clean and mean\u201d son and daughter-in-law in Los Angeles routinely order one entree for two people, and often have leftovers to take home for lunch the next day. In fact, my daughter-in-law usually requests a to-go container when the meal is ordered and packs up the excess food even before they dig in.\\r\\nStill, Dr. Young insists \u2014 and I agree \u2014 that it\u2019s far more helpful to prepare and eat most of your meals at home. You\u2019ll know what\u2019s in them (was that grilled fish you ordered prepared with a tablespoon of butter?) and how much lands on your plate. In fact, start by downsizing your dinner dishes to salad-plate size, and you can save nearly 600 calories a meal. Use measuring cups to dole out reasonable portions until you are able to eyeball them accurately. You might also invest in a kitchen scale to help you keep meat, poultry and fish servings to three or four ounces.\\r\\nI know you\u2019ve heard this before, but it bears repeating: Fill half or more of your plate with low-carbohydrate vegetables, like broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, green beans, carrots and brussels sprouts, and have a side salad with a dribble of dressing. Limit starchy vegetables like white and sweet potatoes (baked, not fried) and grains (whole, not refined) to a half-cup serving, one-cup max.\\r\\nDr. Young urges people to \u201cget over their fear of carbs \u2014 if you\u2019re eating the right kinds of grains in the right amounts, they don\u2019t make you fat. They make you full \u2014 and provide you with a battalion of disease-fighting nutrients,\u201d she wrote. But watch out for those oversized New York bagels, whole grain or otherwise, that are the caloric equivalent of six slices of bread.\\r\\nMany people are unaware of how much, or how often, they eat. Keeping a food diary, recording everything you consume and where for a week or so, can help you recognize sources of mindless or excess consumption and their relationship to your feelings and circumstances.\\r\\nBe wary of \u201cnutrition halos\u201d \u2014 foods deemed healthful but loaded with calories, albeit from healthy fats. A friend who moved to California gained 25 pounds in a year eating avocados from the tree in her yard. A serving of avocado is \u00bc cup. Same for nuts, which, along with air-popped corn, are my favorite snacks.\\r\\nAt the same time, Dr. Young and I recognize the dangers inherent in feeling deprived of cherished, not-so-good-for you foods. When I was shedding those 40 pounds, I included one small treat a day \u2014 a few tablespoons of ice cream, a small cookie, a slice of quick bread, or sliver of cake or pie \u2014 lest after weeks of no treats I break down and devour half a cake or quart of ice cream at one sitting.\\r\\nDr. Young suggests incorporating \u201ctreats and sweets\u201d into your food plan, a few times a week, though perhaps not every day while you\u2019re trying to lose weight. And, as Dr. Sylvia R. Karasu, clinical professor of psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medicine, points out in her fun- and fact-filled new book, \u201cOf Epidemic Proportions: Expanded Edition 2019,\u201d it helps to keep those treats out of sight and easy reach.\\r\\nNext week: Your pets may need to trim down, too.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-164165755,\"description\":\"If you\u2019re serious about losing or maintaining weight, learn the size of a healthful portion and treat restaurant servings as enough for two or more.\\r\",\"title\":\"Personal Health: For Real Weight Control, Try Portion Control\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"health.28.txt\"}],\"labelMap\":[[-1470032073,\"technology\"],[1620813714,\"science\"],[391006090,\"world\"],[1668447843,\"technology\"],[-1492412555,\"business\"],[-1004715158,\"technology\"],[-727259249,\"world\"],[1884837133,\"science\"],[-1501740769,\"technology\"],[-634690071,\"business\"],[1125083330,\"science\"],[1229292121,\"world\"],[411863084,\"world\"],[-1361980079,\"world\"],[489669537,\"world\"],[-1709632295,\"business\"],[326879815,\"science\"],[650611067,\"technology\"],[494067761,\"health\"],[1957449218,\"technology\"],[-582939649,\"technology\"],[-1116953762,\"health\"],[-1521949661,\"world\"],[-1309279343,\"world\"],[-1781385766,\"technology\"],[-1919147376,\"technology\"],[288498403,\"world\"],[254470884,\"technology\"],[1823608100,\"technology\"],[-583240374,\"technology\"],[2025704318,\"technology\"],[-96237933,\"world\"],[409830808,\"technology\"],[829092437,\"technology\"],[-957075741,\"world\"],[-1986019822,\"technology\"],[-990418623,\"science\"],[2064830945,\"technology\"],[-1418713501,\"world\"],[-1904714508,\"world\"],[-2030941738,\"business\"],[-1059350140,\"world\"],[-976253369,\"world\"],[1254265346,\"world\"],[1792994965,\"technology\"],[65063940,\"world\"],[-2122718852,\"technology\"],[-1045290466,\"business\"],[1189967463,\"business\"],[-1070819612,\"business\"],[-1529928416,\"business\"],[2059735833,\"technology\"],[-373522571,\"world\"],[-2146313290,\"science\"],[511430857,\"technology\"],[1502437256,\"technology\"],[-825453762,\"business\"],[1425051396,\"world\"],[-1250615417,\"health\"],[-324448097,\"world\"],[-164165755,\"technology\"]],\"confusionMatrix\":[[0,0,0,5,6],[1,1,1,4,2],[1,0,0,3,1],[1,0,2,7,2],[5,0,1,1,6]],\"confusionLabels\":[\"business\",\"health\",\"science\",\"technology\",\"world\"],\"relabelingLabelMap\":[[-1781385766,\"technology\"],[-1309279343,\"world\"],[-1116953762,\"health\"],[-582939649,\"technology\"],[494067761,\"health\"],[650611067,\"technology\"],[326879815,\"science\"],[-1709632295,\"business\"],[489669537,\"world\"],[411863084,\"world\"],[1125083330,\"science\"],[-634690071,\"health\"],[-1501740769,\"technology\"],[-727259249,\"technology\"],[-1492412555,\"world\"],[1668447843,\"business\"],[1792994965,\"health\"],[-2122718852,\"health\"],[-164165755,\"health\"],[1028732566,\"health\"],[1705918815,\"health\"],[-1222156594,\"world\"]],\"accuracy\":0.32786885245901637,\"correctRelabeled\":[-582939649,494067761,326879815],\"labelingPrecision\":0.2727272727272727,\"labelingRecall\":0.07317073170731707,\"correctAssignedItems\":[-1116953762,-582939649,494067761,326879815,-1709632295,1125083330],\"assignmentPrecision\":0.2727272727272727,\"openedItems\":[],\"numOpenedItems\":0,\"selectedItems\":[],\"selectedInCategory\":0,\"selectionRecall\":null},{\"modelOperation\":\"update\",\"changedFiles\":[{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"TOKYO \u2014 The paperwork never ends for Yoshiko Nishimasa.\\r\\nThere are the meticulous logs she must fill out every day, not to mention the pages of work she carefully checks and approves with a personalized stamp. She even keeps daily records of conversations, activities and meals.\\r\\nBut none of this bookkeeping is for her job as a marketing professional. It\u2019s all for her children\u2019s preschool \u2014 before she can even head to the office.\\r\\nLike so many working mothers in Japan, Ms. Nishimasa, 38, is swamped by onerous, bureaucratic tasks that have nothing to do with her profession but constrain her participation in the work force at a time when the country says it desperately needs more from women like her.\\r\\nJapan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has an explicit goal of energizing his nation\u2019s puttering economy by elevating women in the labor force, an initiative catchily referred to as \u201cwomenomics.\u201d\\r\\nAt the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January, Mr. Abe boasted that 67 percent of women were working in Japan, an all-time high and \u201chigher than, say, in the United States.\u201d\\r\\nBut many of those women are stuck in limited roles in the workplace, and one of the biggest hindrances to their ambitions \u2014 and the nation\u2019s as a whole \u2014 is the disproportionate burden women shoulder at home.\\r\\nIt is a legacy of the country\u2019s exacting domestic expectations and rigid gender roles for who performs them. While Japanese women have entered the work force at historic levels, their avalanche of domestic responsibilities is not shrinking \u2014 and men are typically not helping.\\r\\nIn fact, men in Japan do fewer hours of household chores and child care than in any of the world\u2019s wealthiest nations.\\r\\nAccording to an analysis of government data by Noriko O. Tsuya, an economics professor at Keio University in Tokyo, women who work more than 49 hours a week typically do close to 25 hours of housework a week. Their husbands do an average of less than five.\\r\\n\u201cCompared with what happened in women\u2019s employment,\u201d said Ms. Tsuya, \u201cthere has been so little change, or a lack thereof, in gender relations at home.\u201d\\r\\nConsider Ms. Nishimasa\u2019s daily routine. The preschool her two youngest children attend requires the family to keep daily journals recording their temperatures and what they eat twice a day, along with descriptions of their moods, sleeping hours and playtime. On top of that, her 8-year-old son\u2019s elementary school and after-school tutoring class require that a parent personally signs off on every homework assignment.\\r\\nThe paperwork, of course, is just the beginning. There is cooking, cleaning and laundry, often at a scale that far exceeds what most Westerners do. Cooking a typical Japanese dinner often involves preparing multiple small dishes. Packed lunches can be works of art. Dishwashers are not yet ubiquitous. And as for laundry, few families own dryers big enough for large loads, so wet clothes are generally hoisted on clotheslines.\\r\\nShe does the vast majority of it all.\\r\\nHer husband, a management consultant, often stays late at the office or goes out drinking with clients \u2014 which are also deeply entrenched expectations in Japan, particularly for men.\\r\\nBut Japan\u2019s economy needs educated women like Ms. Nishimasa to work to their full potential. After World War II, as the nation entered a period of rapid economic growth, Japanese women typically quit work when they married or gave birth, taking care of the home while their husbands worked punishingly long hours to power Japan Inc.\u2019s industrial expansion.\\r\\nIn the late 1970s, married women slowly started to enter the work force. Then, when Japan\u2019s stock and property bubbles popped in the early 1990s, large numbers of them went back to work to keep their families afloat financially.\\r\\nAfter that, Japan, once the economic powerhouse of Asia, struggled to lift itself from a protracted period of stagnation. It was overtaken by China as the world\u2019s second-largest economy in 2011, and Mr. Abe has staked much of his reputation on returning the economy to steady growth and keeping it from becoming a global afterthought.\\r\\nNow, with a declining and rapidly aging population, Japanese employers are struggling with a severe labor shortage. And while the government has expanded some visa categories for foreigners, the country is still opposed to increasing immigration significantly. So Mr. Abe has underscored the importance of working women to shore up the economy for the long term.\\r\\nBut more than half of working women are employed part time, and about a third are on temporary contracts, reinforcing a large pay gap between men and women.\\r\\nAccording to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, women in Japan represent fewer than 1 percent of management positions, compared with an average of 4.6 percent among the world\u2019s most developed nations.\\r\\nKathy Matsui, a Goldman Sachs strategist who wrote influential papers that Mr. Abe relied on when formulating his \u201cwomenomics\u201d policy, said that raising women\u2019s employment rates to the same level as men\u2019s could increase the country\u2019s economic output by more than 10 percent.\\r\\nBut the boost to the Japanese economy would be much larger if women could pursue higher-level careers and were appropriately paid, Ms. Matsui added.\\r\\n\u201cHow do we make that happen?\u201d she said.\\r\\nAt the moment, Japanese women often face a double-edged sword.\\r\\nLike many Japanese companies, Ms. Nishimasa\u2019s employer accommodates her towering domestic responsibilities. Until her youngest child, now 2, enters second grade, she can work a shortened seven-hour day, albeit for 30 percent lower pay. She is never asked to do the kind of overtime she regularly put in before her children were born, when she was often at the office until 10 p.m. or later.\\r\\nBut because of that, she has not been promoted in eight years and has received scant pay raises.\\r\\n\u201cWhen I asked why,\u201d she said, \u201cmy boss said my output was lower because I work fewer hours.\u201d\\r\\nOverstretched at Home and Work\\r\\nAfter Ms. Nishimasa graduated from a top university in Tokyo, she worked for a textbook publisher as a sales associate. With a sunny disposition and her ease at striking up conversations, she quickly excelled.\\r\\nShe married four years later. Much to her shock, the company automatically converted her employment status to part-time, she said.\\r\\n\u201cMy boss started saying, \u2018You are not long for this job because you\u2019re probably just going to go off and have kids, right?\u2019\u201d she recalled.\\r\\nShe looked for another job, but prospective employers said, \u201cYou probably can\u2019t work late, right?\u201d or \u201cDoes your husband understand how busy you will be?\u201d\\r\\nThe publisher where she landed did not ask her marital status. But the hours were intense, and when she did get pregnant, at 29, she did not slow down, often remaining in the office until midnight. She miscarried in the final month of her pregnancy.\\r\\nShe got pregnant again, yet continued working long hours, anxious not to appear to be shirking her share of the work. When she left at 10 p.m., she recalled, \u201cI was the earliest one leaving and I would have to beg my colleagues for forgiveness.\u201d\\r\\nAfter giving birth, Ms. Nishimasa never thought of quitting. But because her husband is expected to meet rigorous targets for raises and promotions, Ms. Nishimasa cut back on work to take care of the children.\\r\\n\u201cTheoretically, it sounds ideal to have me work fewer hours and Yoshiko work more,\u201d said her husband, Kazuhiro Nishimasa. \u201cBut realistically, it is not feasible.\u201d\\r\\nThe juggle took a toll. One rainy morning, Ms. Nishimasa wrestled with the children while rushing down the stairs with two big bags of clothes, towels, washcloths and water bottles required by their day care. In her hurry, she slipped and fell, breaking a leg.\\r\\n\u201cI was pushing myself too much,\u201d she said.\\r\\nAfter the accident, Mr. Nishimasa came home early in the evenings for two months and agreed to drop off the children at day care on his way to work, one of the few tasks he still handles for the family.\\r\\nNow, Mr. Nishimasa is back to working long hours to keep up with their mortgage payments. He rarely makes it home before 10 p.m., and is often out much later. On Saturdays, he sleeps in while his wife shuttles the three children to piano lessons or sports activities before he wakes up.\\r\\nSince Ms. Nishimasa broke her leg, her husband has never left work in the middle of the day. If a child gets sick or hurt, or if school ends early, she gets the call every time.\\r\\nMs. Nishimasa tries getting to work early once a week. She helps get the children dressed, makes breakfast and then heads to the office to snag some quiet time before most of her colleagues arrive.\\r\\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t strictly reserve that time,\u201d she said, \u201cmy husband will leave everything to me.\u201d\\r\\nGender Equality a Distant Dream\\r\\nJust over half of Japanese mothers go back to work after the birth of their first child. But they often have part-time jobs while their husbands continue to work brutal hours, contributing to a phenomenon known as \u201ckaroshi,\u201d or \u201cdeath from overwork.\u201d\\r\\nSome experts argue that Japan\u2019s culture of overwork is unnecessary, leading to inefficiencies and low productivity. If everyone worked fewer hours, women might be able to catch up and Japanese society as a whole would benefit, they contend.\\r\\nDespite some efforts to modify the work culture, excessive hours remain the norm, helping explain why men contribute so little to housework or child care: They simply do not have much time.\\r\\n\u201cIf the work day could be shortened in Japan, I think a younger generation of men would do more as fathers,\u201d said Margarita Estevez-Abe, associate professor of political science at Syracuse University.\\r\\nEntrenched cultural expectations are another obstacle.\\r\\nLast year, when Daiwa House, a homebuilder, conducted a survey of 300 working couples, most of the respondents said that women completed close to 90 percent of the chores at home, many of them unacknowledged by their husbands. The results went viral on social media under the hashtag \u201cnamonaki kaji,\u201d which roughly translates as \u201cinvisible house chores.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cThe awareness of men is still so low,\u201d said Kazuko Yoshida, 38, a graphic designer and mother of two young children in Tokyo. \u201cMy husband does not have a gender equality concept.\u201d\\r\\nMs. Yoshida drops off and picks up the children every day, and cooks, cleans, bathes and puts them to bed each night. When the preschool asked parents to make a handmade doll for each child, Ms. Yoshida stayed up nights sewing them.\\r\\nHer husband, Takahisa Yoshida, says he wants to be more involved with his children than his own father, who did nothing at home. But he says he does not have the confidence to handle two young children on his own.\\r\\n\u201cI work so hard,\u201d he said. \u201cI come home late at night and am exhausted in the morning.\u201d\\r\\nAs Ms. Yoshida left the office to pick up her children, she sat on the platform at the train station and let two trains go by before climbing into a packed car to head to the day care center. It was her only break all day.\\r\\n Multitasking Moms\\r\\nOn a Friday afternoon, Ms. Nishimasa dashed out of the office to pick up her daughter Mei, 5, and youngest son, Haruki, 2, heading straight for the child-size mattresses stacked in their preschool.\\r\\nShe grabbed their nap pads, stripped off the sheets and blankets and put on a fresh set she had washed at home. She planned to come back with even more sheets the next day \u2014 a Saturday \u2014 to make the scramble of the workweek a little more manageable.\\r\\nThen she retrieved Mei\u2019s indoor shoes \u2014 they also needed washing \u2014 before a teacher handed her some construction paper: a weekend homework assignment to make a flag.\\r\\nOutside, with the wind gusting, Ms. Nishimasa loaded both children onto a bicycle, shoved a teddy bear into a bag of laundry, hiked up her skirt and climbed on for the ride home.\\r\\nThey arrived just after 6 p.m. Ten minutes later, her oldest son, Kazuaki, 8, breezed in from an after-school program, dumping his backpack and snatching candy from Haruki\u2019s hands, prompting the toddler to bleat in protest.\\r\\nMs. Nishimasa strapped on an apron and began chopping, fixing an array of dishes: marinated cucumber and tomato salad, mustard greens with sesame seeds, steamed squash and hot bowls of miso soup and rice.\\r\\nThe children, indifferent to the spread, gazed at cartoons. Ms. Nishimasa snatched bites of dinner while loading the washing machine and drawing a bath. She checked Kazuaki\u2019s homework for the corrections ordered by his teacher, rinsed the dishes and put the leftovers away.\\r\\nOne after another, the children popped in and out of the bath. She tried, unsuccessfully, to coax them to bed. It was after 9 p.m., but she made herself a cup of coffee, hoping she might actually get to drink it before it got cold.\\r\\nJust before 10 p.m., her phone buzzed with a text. It was not her husband, who was out drinking with clients. It was another mother, asking for a breakfast play date the next morning, while their husbands would be sleeping in.\\r\\nMs. Nishimasa then got back to work, reviewing the preschool journals.

A software update will be released next week, the company said.\\r\\nThe new update will allow owners of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers to re-enable Group FaceTime, the feature that had allowed the potential eavesdropping, Apple said. (Instructions on how to update a device\u2019s software are below.)\\r\\nApple\u2019s response came four days after the flaw was widely reported, and nearly two weeks since a concerned customer alerted the company. This week, before fixing the bug, the company raced to disable Group FaceTime, which allows people to video chat with several people.\\r\\nA 14-year-old Arizona boy discovered that he could listen to a friend via Group FaceTime on Jan. 19, even if the friend didn\u2019t answer the call. His mother repeatedly tried to flag the issue to Apple, but the company was slow to respond.\\r\\n\u201cWe want to assure our customers that as soon as our engineering team became aware of the details necessary to reproduce the bug, they quickly disabled Group FaceTime and began work on the fix,\u201d an Apple spokesman said in a statement Friday. \u201cWe are committed to improving the process by which we receive and escalate these reports, in order to get them to the right people as fast as possible.\u201d\\r\\nThe incident was embarrassing for a company that regularly boasts about the safety of its products. Hours before Apple publicly acknowledged the bug \u2014 branded \u201cFacePalm\u201d by security researchers \u2014 on Monday, Timothy D. Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive, tweeted that \u201cwe all must insist on action and reform for vital privacy protections.\u201d\\r\\nAfter the vulnerability became public, security researchers and politicians raised concerns about the security of Apple\u2019s products. To pre-empt security attacks, in 2016 Apple started offering hackers a $200,000 bounty if they flagged bugs to the company. But some hackers have said the program has had a slow start because they can make more money selling the flaws on the black market.\\r\\nTo install the update when it is released, follow these steps for iPhones, iPads and Macs:\\r\\n\u25a0 On an iPhone or an iPad, open the Settings app, then tap General and then tap Software Update.

Opioid drugs do have a place in pain management, and if used properly, they should not pose a danger of addiction. And publicity around the opioid epidemic should not get in the way of prescribing the most effective drugs to children with serious illnesses and terrible pain.\\r\\nDr. Linda J. Mason, a professor of anesthesia and pediatrics at Loma Linda University and the president of the society, emphasized that parents should understand that \u201cthere are alternatives to opioid pain management\u201d and that they should be asking questions of their children\u2019s doctors. And when children do take opioid medications, Dr. Mason said, parents need to understand how the medicines can be safely stored, and how any leftover doses can be disposed of.\\r\\n\u201cOpioids are very potent relievers of pain, very effective,\u201d Dr. Mason said. \u201cBut they have addictive properties, and also side effects, like respiratory depression.\u201d When she takes care of a child having surgery, Dr. Mason said, she may start with opioids and then move on quickly to other drugs.\\r\\nDr. Elliot J. Krane, professor of anesthesiology and pediatrics at Stanford University and chief of pain management at the Packard Children\u2019s Hospital at Stanford, noted that the pain-relieving properties of opium poppy plants were discovered 5,000 years ago, in ancient Mesopotamia. \u201cWhy are we still using a 5,000-year-old drug? Because they work,\u201d he said.\\r\\nBut they are also drugs with dangerous side effects, including respiratory depression, and they raise serious issues of abuse and addiction.\\r\\nSome studies have shown connections between prescription opioid use in the young and later misuse; Dr. Krane and his colleagues have argued that the data do not support this as a causal relationship, and that the risk of addiction is tied to genetic and psychological vulnerability and not merely exposure. He was a co-author of a 2018 editorial in the journal Pediatrics that called for collecting much more data about the use and misuse of opioids in children.\\r\\nDr. Krane said that he and his colleagues avoid opioids when there are alternatives, because of concern about side effects. In an email he wrote that, as one of his colleagues says, he is \u201cneither pro-opioid nor anti-opioid, but pro-patient.\u201d He wrote: \u201cA very small percent of my chronic pain patients are prescribed opioids, no more than five to 10 at any time out of many hundreds of children and teens in my patient panel.\u201d\\r\\nBut he argued that, based on the data on misuse and addiction, \u201cin the absence of risk factors or concerns about the child\u2019s home environment, I am more concerned about deleterious effects of untreated pain than I am about creating somebody with substance abuse disorder.\u201d And opioid abuse is not an overriding concern, he said, \u201cin children or adolescents who are prescribed them rationally and appropriately.\u201d\\r\\nThere is definitely a new onus on doctors to make sure that the prescribing is rational and appropriate, especially around some of the most common situations in which opioids are prescribed, including dental procedures, orthopedic procedures and emergency room visits. \\r\\nOf course, the prescribing doctor should know if a patient may be especially vulnerable to addiction, whether because of warning signs in the family history, psychiatric disease or adolescent experimenting.\\r\\n\u201cTraditionally, oral surgeons tended to be among the highest prescribers of opioids to adolescents,\u201d said Dr. Charles Berde, the founder of the division of pain medicine at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital. With the proactive use of acetaminophen and ibuprofen around the clock, he said, most adolescents who had their wisdom teeth extracted did not need any oxycodone at all. And for those who do, he said, \u201cfour pills is enough to cover the great majority of kids.\u201d\\r\\nIn the past, Dr. Mason said, children were often prescribed too many pills, which can contribute to the risk of using the medication longer than strictly necessary, and to leftover doses remaining in the medicine cabinet.\\r\\n\u201cYou should not keep them for use for a future time,\u201d Dr. Mason said. \u201cThese are for a specific surgery,\u201d and any that remain should be disposed of, not left around to be perhaps used by another family member, or found by an exploring toddler \u2014 or visiting adolescent. She recommended taking them to a local pharmacy or health center, or to a police station, or else mixing them with dirt or kitty litter before throwing them away.\\r\\nA study published in December in JAMA Pediatrics found a threefold increase in the mortality rate among children and adolescents from opioid poisoning, both by prescription drugs and by illicit drugs, over the past two decades. In addition to deaths among adolescents, the rate increased markedly among children under 4, underscoring the need to store these drugs safely and dispose of any leftover doses.\\r\\nPediatric orthopedists are looking at whether children need any opioids at all in certain situations, said Dr. Joshua M. Abzug, the director of pediatric orthopedics and deputy surgeon in chief at the University of Maryland Children\u2019s Hospital, who was the co-author of a 2018 review article on managing pediatric orthopedic pain in the setting of the opioid epidemic. And when they do need them, he said, doctors should limit the prescriptions to only the few pills that the child is likely to need.\\r\\nIt\u2019s important to start at the preoperative evaluation, Dr. Abzug said, and set expectations with both the child and the parent, acknowledging that the child may have some pain, but it should not be overwhelming, and \u201cwe can combat that pain with other medications.\u201d\\r\\nImportant strategies for orthopedic surgeries, he said, include long-acting injectable local anesthetics, which can decrease the need of opioids, and multimodal pain relief by mixing different kinds of drugs, such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, like ibuprofen.\\r\\n\u201cIf the child does need an opioid, that\u2019s O.K., we don\u2019t want them writhing in pain,\u201d Dr. Abzug said. The child should then shift, as soon as possible, to other medications.\\r\\nAnd while everyone is profoundly aware of the risks associated with opioids, the most important message of pain management is that pain needs to be managed. \u201cTreating pain adequately helps recovery, reduces the downstream psychiatric and psychological effects,\u201d said Dr. Krane.\\r\\nNot treating pain adequately may cause post-traumatic stress disorder, said Dr. Stefan Friedrichsdorf, the medical director of pain medicine and palliative care at Children\u2019s Minnesota. Opioids are important for children after major surgery, trauma or burns, he said, and certainly for those in palliative care,\\r\\nParents whose children will need pain control \u2014 after an injury, after an operation, after a dental extraction \u2014 should ask questions, Dr. Abzug said. Even for injuries like bone fractures, it is often enough to alternate anti-inflammatory medications and acetaminophen.\\r\\nAsk about options, ask about local or regional anesthesia, ask about who will be available if the pain medication \u2014 whatever it is \u2014 proves insufficient.\\r\\nAnd after considering all the alternatives, if opioids are necessary, parents need to be vigilant about supervising the dosage, and properly disposing of extra pills.\\r\\nDr. Mason suggested asking, \u201cWhat would be good for my child\u2019s pain as we transition out of the first 24 hours?\u201d Ask about the side effects, she said, ask about what to do with drugs that are left over. \u201cParents who are well-informed can give the best care to their children.\u201d\\r\\nThis is the fourth in a series of columns on children\u2019s pain.

The company has set an ambitious goal of churning out cars from a new factory in China by the end of the year. And it struggles to provide the kind of customer service that buyers of luxury automobiles expect. Tesla also is planning to spend heavily on a new model even as a big bond payment reduces its cash reserves.\\r\\nStill, Elon Musk, the chief executive, says he believes Tesla\u2019s toughest times are behind it.\\r\\n\u201cThis is going to be an amazing year for Tesla,\u201d he said on a conference call to discuss the company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic about being profitable in the first quarter, and all quarters going forward.\u201d\\r\\nThe automaker\u2019s earnings in the final three months of 2018 leave some doubt about whether its profits will continue to grow. It reported $139 million in earnings in the fourth quarter, a substantial drop from the third quarter, despite a nearly 6 percent jump in revenue, to $7.2 billion.\\r\\nThe company blamed the introduction of lower-priced Model 3 variants that generate less profit than costlier versions, price cuts on the vehicles it exports to China and fewer sales of emissions credits to other carmakers.\\r\\nTesla said it had $3.7 billion in cash, an increase of about $700 million from Sept. 30. With that rise, Tesla said it would be able to make a $920 million payment to its bondholders in March, solving one of the most critical questions about the company\u2019s finances.\\r\\nInvestors had been concerned about how Tesla would pay off the bonds, fearing the company could be left squeezed for cash. Tesla could have made part of the bond payment in stock if its share price had been above $360, a level it exceeded for part of last year.\\r\\nThe shares closed Wednesday at $308.77 but dropped nearly 5 percent in aftermarket trading after the company announced that its chief financial officer, Deepak Ahuja, would retire without saying exactly when.\\r\\nTesla said its revenue rose nearly 6 percent to $7.2 billion.\\r\\nMr. Musk predicted the company would deliver 360,000 to 400,000 cars this year, up from 245,000 in 2018, driven by higher sales of the Model 3. The company also said it anticipated lower North American vehicle sales in the current quarter compared to the fourth quarter. At the same time, it expects to begin sales in Europe and China.\\r\\nThe company also said it anticipated lower North American vehicle sales in the current quarter compared to the fourth quarter.\\r\\nSome analysts believe increasing sales may prove tough, now that sales of the Model S luxury sedan and Model X S.U.V. are flattening, and the federal tax credit available to Tesla customers has fallen to $3,750 as of Jan. 1. Last year, customers were eligible for credits of $7,500. And soon it will face competition from other luxury car makers.\\r\\n\u201cTesla\u2019s product lineup is starting to get stale, and now thanks to the elimination of the federal tax credit, buying one has never been more expensive,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst at Edmunds, an auto-information provider. \u201cWhile there\u2019s still a cool factor to owning a Tesla, it may not be enough to convince buyers to choose one over brand-new models from Audi, Porsche and Jaguar.\u201d\\r\\nTesla\u2019s most affordable car is a midrange variant of the Model 3 that starts at $44,000 before tax incentives. Adding options can push the price up to $70,000 or more \u2014 well outside the range of most mainstream buyers.\\r\\nTesla originally promised that the Model 3 would start at $35,000, but Mr. Musk has said the automaker would lose money if it sold the car at that price now. Earlier this month, he said the company would cut 3,000 jobs \u2014 about 7 percent of its full-time work force \u2014 to reduce costs.\\r\\nTesla is investing heavily to add showrooms, service centers and charging stations, expand into additional markets and develop new models. These include an electric pickup truck, a semi truck and a small sport-utility vehicle, the Model Y, which Tesla has said it will unveil this year.\\r\\nMr. Musk has repeatedly said Tesla won\u2019t issue more bonds or sell additional stock to finance its ambitious plans, but many analysts are skeptical. The company is already carrying nearly $10 billion in debt. Issuing new bonds would increase its debt load. Selling additional stock could worry investors.\\r\\nAt one time, Tesla said it had more than 400,000 reservations for the Model 3, enough to keep sales and production humming through 2019. Some were deposits on the $35,000 version of the Model 3\\r\\nMr. Musk said Tesla aimed to start production of the Model 3 in China by the end of the year, at a factory that has not yet been built. Producing cars in China will enable Tesla to avoid that country\u2019s import tariffs that hamper its sales now.\\r\\nThe company will also have to spend heavily to build more delivery centers in the United States.

That accord expires in 2021, just weeks after the next presidential inauguration.\\r\\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the decision to suspend the accord, declaring that \u201ccountries must be held accountable when they break the rules.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cWe can no longer be restricted by the treaty while Russia shamelessly violates it,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said, adding that the United States would terminate the accord in six months unless Russia destroyed its growing arsenal of intermediate-range missiles and launchers.\\r\\nMr. Trump said later that \u201cI hope we\u2019re able to get everybody in a big, beautiful room and do a new treaty that would be much better.\u201d He did not define what he meant by \u201ceverybody.\u201d\\r\\nThe Russian government counteraccused the Trump administration of looking for any excuse to end the Cold War-era agreement. Dmitri S. Peskov, the spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin, said the United States failed to negotiate in good faith.\\r\\n\u201cOn the whole, the reluctance of the Americans to listen to reason and to hold any kind of substantive talks with us shows that Washington decided to crush the treaty a long time ago,\u201d Mr. Peskov told reporters.\\r\\nIn a series of public and private comments, the president and Trump administration officials have made clear they are seeking a new strategy that would revive the treaty \u2014 but only if all countries that now field such weapons are willing to curb or eliminate them. The current agreement applies only to Russia and the United States.\\r\\nThat would be an enormously ambitious task. It would require China, India, Pakistan, Iran and North Korea to sign on to the same agreement. That is much tougher than negotiating a bilateral treaty between Russia and the United States, which still possess, by far, the world\u2019s largest nuclear arsenals.\\r\\nWhile the administration has not yet formally announced any such effort, a range of officials pointed to language used by Mr. Trump at the Pentagon last month to embrace a new missile defense strategy. \u201cFor too long, we have been held back by self-imposed limits while foreign competitors grow and they advance more than we have over the years,\u201d he said.\\r\\nSome experts are skeptical.\\r\\n\u201cNobody in the administration has laid out what the action-reaction cycle looks like as the United States makes all these moves \u2014 building new warheads, withdrawing from treaties, pursuing new missiles,\u201d said Jon Wolfsthal, a nuclear expert on the National Security Council during the Obama administration.\\r\\n\u201cThe enemy gets a vote,\u201d he added. \u201cThe idea that we\u2019re going to do these things, and they\u2019re going to stand still, is nonsensical. They\u2019re going to respond for both political and military reasons.\u201d\\r\\nOne thing is clear: If a new arms race begins, it will be expensive. While the makeover of America\u2019s aging nuclear arsenal and laboratories began during the Obama administration, the ambitions to remake the United States\u2019 nuclear capabilities have accelerated under Mr. Trump.\\r\\nFor the next 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office said in January, the cost of nuclear upgrades has increased to $494 billion, or 87 times the amount Mr. Trump is seeking for his border wall. Over the next 30 years, the estimate is $1.2 trillion.\\r\\nThe move on Friday to suspend and likely end the I.N.F. treaty, once considered the gold standard of arms control agreements, was telegraphed months ago.\\r\\nThe United States began accusing Russia of violating the treaty in 2014, when it revealed that Moscow was developing a new missile that would violate the range limits. The Russian government maintains that missile battalions it has deployed near European borders would not fly far enough to violate the treaty\u2019s terms.\\r\\nRussian officials have raced to portray the United States as the nation at fault.\\r\\nThey charge that American missile defense interceptors in Eastern Europe could be easily refashioned into offensive weapons, and that the rise of armed drones, which had not been invented when the treaty was signed, now threaten to provide Washington with similar intermediate-range ability without violating the precise wording of the treaty.\\r\\nAmerican senior national security officials, notably John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, have made no secret of their desire to leave arms control agreements that limit American action.\\r\\nDuring the administration of President George W. Bush, Mr. Bolton was a major force behind the withdrawal fromthe Antiballistic Missile Treaty with Russia. Last year, he pressed Mr. Trump to end the 2015 Iran nuclear accord with world powers. In the I.N.F. treaty, Mr. Bolton had an easy target: Even President Barack Obama had considered exiting it.\\r\\nThe question now is whether the United States will begin to deploy new weapons to counter China\u2019s efforts to cement a dominant position in the Western Pacific and keep American aircraft carriers at bay. Much of Beijing\u2019s growing arsenal currently consists of missiles that fall into the ranges \u2014 land-based missiles able to fly 300 to 3,400 miles \u2014 that are prohibited by the treaty.\\r\\nChina was still a small and unsophisticated military power when Ronald Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the last leader of a rapidly weakening Soviet Union, negotiated the I.N.F. agreement.\\r\\nThe decision to leave it took American allies by surprise when word of the decision first leaked in October. Since then, European capitals have been caught between their fears of Mr. Trump\u2019s unilateral instincts and their recognition that Mr. Putin poses a growing threat.\\r\\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the military alliance that was created to counter the Soviet threat 70 years ago, said on Friday that Russia was \u201cfully responsible\u201d for the breach of the treaty.\\r\\n\u201cThe United States is taking this action in response to the significant risks to Euro-Atlantic security,\u201d said Jen Stoltenberg, the secretary general of the Atlantic alliance.\\r\\nMr. Trump\u2019s critics in Congress, however, immediately condemned the decision and pledged to introduce legislation seeking to stop the country from withdrawing from the treaty in six months.\\r\\nSenator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, who focuses on nuclear issues on the Foreign Relations Committee, called the treaty\u2019s suspension \u201ca tragedy that makes the world less safe.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cPresident Trump and his war cabinet have yet again decided that America should go it alone, this time, by paving the way for a dangerous arms race,\u201d he said.\\r\\nIt seems unlikely that Mr. Pompeo\u2019s announcement will result in a flurry of last-minute negotiations with Moscow, and it could accelerate the Cold War-like behavior among the United States, Russia and China. American intelligence agencies\u2019 warned this week that Russia and China were \u201cmore aligned than at any point since the mid-1950s.\u201d\\r\\nThe fate of the treaty has quickly become a test of the struggle inside the Trump administration, and with its allies, over how to handle an increasingly aggressive Russia.\\r\\nMr. Trump campaigned on remaking Washington\u2019s relationship with Moscow; the open investigation by the Justice Department\u2019s special counsel is, at its core, about whether he and his campaign aides promised to relieve sanctions and other impediments to Russia in return for financial or electoral benefits from Mr. Putin\u2019s government.\\r\\nRussia was first to have second thoughts about the I.N.F. treaty. It complained to the Bush administration 12 years ago that newer nuclear powers, chiefly China, were not constrained by its terms. They proposed expanding it to include other major nuclear states.\\r\\nThat logic, said Graham Allison, a Harvard professor known for his studies of nuclear strategy dating to the Cuban missile crisis, \u201cis correct.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cBut whether the Chinese and others would agree \u2014 I doubt it,\u201d Mr. Allison said.\\r\\nIf China refused, so would India, which feels threatened by Beijing\u2019s nuclear fleet. If India failed to sign on, Pakistan would reject the limits.\\r\\nComplicating the diplomatic issue is another, less publicized announcement that recently came from the Energy Department: For the first time in 28 years, the United States began producing a new warhead for a strategic weapon \u2014 the long-range weapons devised to reach Russia, China or North Korea.\\r\\nThe announcement was not entirely surprising. In early 2018, the Trump administration indicated in a nuclear strategy review that it would develop a new warhead for an unspecified number of Trident missiles, which are carried aboard submarines. The first of those weapons \u2014 called a W76-2 \u2014 is now being assembled at a weapons plant near Amarillo, Tex.\\r\\nIn an emailed statement on Wednesday, the National Nuclear Security Administration, which runs the country\u2019s atomic weapons complex, said it was \u201con track\u201d to complete the initial order and deliver the new warheads to the Navy by the end of this fiscal year. The number it is producing has been kept a secret.\\r\\nThe exact power of the weapon is also secret, but it is widely estimated to be roughly half the Hiroshima blast \u2014 what the Trump administration calls a \u201clow yield\u201d weapon.\\r\\nThe Trump administration has argued that it must match Russian strides in low-yield weaponry to deter conflict, by helping \u201censure that potential adversaries perceive no possible advantage in limited nuclear escalation.\u201d\\r\\nBut critics see the new class of strategic weaponry as making unthinkable outcomes far more likely \u2014 not less. If an American submarine ever fires a Trident missile with a low-yield warhead, critics predict that could provoke a nuclear retaliation before impact.\\r\\nThe cost of the W76-2 and the administration\u2019s other new weapons are raising the price of making over the nation\u2019s nuclear arsenal.\\r\\nLast week, the budget office updated its projections to account for the coming decade though 2028, lifting its estimate by $94 billion.\\r\\nThe House, now under control of the Democrats, is vowing to review that budget. The buildup could result in a new global arms race; it might also be used as a bargaining chip to produce an arms control breakthrough.\\r\\nLast year, when Defense Secretary Jim Mattis testified on Capitol Hill about the administration\u2019s new arms policy, he alluded to a benign outcome. \u201cWe have to give our negotiators,\u201d he said, \u201csomething with which to negotiate.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-811301431,\"description\":\"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged a risk of a new arms race after the suspension of a 1987 treaty banning the deployment of intermediate-range missiles.\\r\",\"title\":\"U.S. Suspends Nuclear Arms Control Treaty With Russia\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"world.13.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"I started noticing it a few years ago: Seemingly every young person on the internet was selling something. Not in the way that we\u2019re all selling ourselves now, cultivating our personal brands on social media. They were selling actual stuff. Shipping hoverboards from China and unloading them in their American high schools. Running parody Twitter accounts that fed into viral ad networks. Posting sponsored content on Instagram for pocket money and freebies.\\r\\nOccasionally these youthful businesses evidenced a casual relationship with grift. The hoverboards literally blew up. The Twitter accounts stole jokes from struggling comics. Teenage influencers started concocting fake brand deals so they could appear worthy of corporate sponsorship.\\r\\nThe sprites behind the schemes could come across as craven; an online crew of viral marketers referred to non-entrepreneurial peers as \u201cpeasants.\u201d But most of them seemed sincere. They wanted to change the world, and they believed that the way to do that was to start their own businesses. Immediately. If corners were cut along the way, they were cut honestly. They were just kids.\\r\\nI\u2019ve been thinking of them as last year\u2019s \u201csummer of scam\u201d has extended into a never-ending, all-weather \u201cscam season.\u201d We are held rapt by tales of big-time millennial grifters, entrepreneurs whose dizzy rises are rivaled only by their disastrous ends. Among them is Billy McFarland (born in 1991), the impresario who dreamed up the doomed Bahamas-based Fyre music festival; Elizabeth Holmes (b. 1984), creator of the at-home blood-testing service Theranos, which was once valued at more than $9 billion but never really worked; and Anna Delvey (b. 1991), the so-called SoHo Scammer, who is said to have passed herself off as a German heiress in a bid to build a plush Manhattan arts club named after herself.\\r\\nNow their tales are fueling a genre of grifter-related entertainment. Earlier this month, Hulu and Netflix dropped rival streaming documentaries on Fyre. Soon HBO will air a documentary about Holmes directed by Alex Gibney, while ABC News has its own documentary and a podcast, too. An Anna Delvey show written by Shonda Rhimes is on its way to Netflix.\\r\\nStories of scammers are reliably captivating. Mark Twain\u2019s fiction held a soft spot for the flimflam man. The terms grifter and scam have their beginnings in the carnival circuit of the early 20th century, and scam is the root of the term scamp \u2014 as in, lovable rogue. There\u2019s a reason we call them con artists.\\r\\nThese people have always exploited a certain proximity to America\u2019s most storied figures. \u201cThe Inventor,\u201d HBO\u2019s Theranos documentary, draws comparisons between Holmes and one of her idols, Thomas Edison, who may have been better at cultivating his public image as an inventor than he was at actually inventing. The math behind the American dream \u2014 a nobody, combined with pure grit, transforms into a somebody \u2014 is already a reach. The grifter just stretches the concept a little further.\\r\\nBut perhaps no moment has been so primed for grift as our current one. As Jia Tolentino wrote in The New Yorker last year: \u201cAt some point between the Great Recession, which began in 2008, and the terrible election of 2016, scamming seems to have become the dominant logic of American life.\u201d The mantras of Silicon Valley \u2014 Think big! Think different! Move fast and break things! \u2014 encourage harebrained scheming. Venture capital requires business ideas to reap more than profits; they must promise explosive growth. And moving fast is presented not as a shortcut to getting rich but a necessary aspect of any successful venture. The grandiose expectations placed on actual children have grown wildly out of proportion with the economic reality into which they\u2019ve been born. Only a scam could bridge the gap.\\r\\nOne of the greatest modern scams is the entrepreneurial fetish itself, and its marks are getting younger and younger. Silicon Valley has always romanticized the college dropout, from Gates and Jobs to Zuckerberg and Holmes. (The ABC News projects on Holmes are titled \u201cThe Dropout.\u201d) Now a broader effort seeks to enlist children into ventures at an age before their prefrontal cortex is fully formed. In 2017, the magazine Teen Bo$$ debuted to set preteens on the fast track to wealth under the tagline \u201cDream big & learn fast!\u201d And last year, Entrepreneur magazine ran its own issue on teen titans, featuring a 13-year-old candy C.E.O. on its cover. Her secret? \u201cI just felt like I had nothing to lose.\u201d By the time she was 10, Holmes had decided what she wanted to be when she grew up: \u201ca billionaire.\u201d\\r\\nMeanwhile, the tools of grift have rarely been more attainable. Early chat rooms introduced a generation of kids to the pastime of pretending to be other people online. Now, everyone with a smartphone can create and manipulate images. And in this hyper-visual culture, constructing an image of something can feel like the most important step in conjuring the thing itself. Just ask the Chinese manufacturers that hawk clothes online with images of glamorous magazine spreads, then ship out disfigured imitations to unsuspecting customers.\\r\\nHolmes was obsessed with the image of a finger-prick drop of blood unlocking a wealth of medical information, and many powerful people liked the picture, too. (\u201cThe Inventor\u201d makes much of a photo shoot in which Holmes holds a tiny red vial between her fingertips.) The only thing the Fyre Festival did well was create a viral ad featuring famous models cavorting on yachts and swimming with pigs. At some level, we are all growing familiar with this kind of sleight of hand. On Instagram, we are training to create beautiful images of ourselves with no possibility \u2014 or really, expectation \u2014 that they be replicated in person.\\r\\nMcFarland may be the one in prison for fraud, but the most fascinating thing about Fyre was how deep the scam reached. The festival was marketed by Jerry Media, an online advertising agency that began as a popular Instagram account that cribbed other peoples\u2019 memes without credit. It was aggressively promoted by Instagram influencers \u2014 those model\/advertiser\/guru hybrids whose entire project rests on smoke and mirrors. Even the documentaries on the festival seemed compromised. Hulu  paid McFarland for an interview, while Elliot Tebele, the founder of Jerry Media, is an executive producer of the Netflix documentary. It was scams all the way down.\\r\\nAnd at the top? The closest-held secret of modern scam artists is how woefully unimaginative they really are. Our oversaturated scam culture seems to have produced something new: utterly unappealing con men and women who could not credibly be referred to as \u201cartists\u201d at all.\\r\\nThough the Fyre documentaries are stocked with associates who swear to McFarland\u2019s charm, he appears to have all the appeal of a sentient airport lounge. Holmes, built up as a striking female entrepreneur with a heartfelt personal story, is revealed as stilted and vampiric onscreen; \u201cThe Inventor\u201d includes a haunting scene in which she celebrates a company win by dancing robotically to MC Hammer. And since her unmasking, Delvey has been dragged on the internet for her tellingly bad hair.\\r\\nThere\u2019s not a lovable scamp or a master chameleon in the bunch. They\u2019re just young people who wanted to make something incredible, failed and couldn\u2019t accept it. In a word, unexceptional. These days, there\u2019s a scammer born every minute.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-403065203,\"description\":\"The conditions that produced Billy McFarland, Anna Delvey and Elizabeth Holmes show no signs of abating.\\r\",\"title\":\"Critic\u2019s Notebook: Fyre Festival, Theranos and Our Never-Ending \u2018Scam Season\u2019\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"technology.25.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"We know many people end up with a risky pileup of prescribed medications. Many efforts have been made, with varied success, to correct this problem. Yet we\u2019ve usually focused on physician behavior, when there\u2019s another powerful lever: pharmacists.\\r\\nAbout 30 percent of older adults in the United States and Canada filled a prescription in the last few years for one of many medications that the American Geriatrics Society recommends they avoid. Such drugs can lead to more harm \u2014 like cognitive impairment or falls \u2014 than good, and often safer options are available.\\r\\n\u201cOlder adults are taking an awful lot of pills these days \u2014 66 percent take five drugs or more per day, and 27 percent take 10 or more per day \u2014 so if some of those pills are no longer necessary and may even be causing harm, why not ask if it is time to deprescribe?\u201d said Dr. Cara Tannenbaum, a professor of medicine and pharmacy at the University of Montreal, and director of the Canadian Deprescribing Network.\\r\\nIt\u2019s not easy to get patients off such drugs, though. Physicians often don\u2019t have enough information about what patients are taking, or may lack the time to talk to patients about these medications. They fear that stopping the drugs might cause harm or make patients upset.\\r\\nTo explore the possible role of pharmacists, Dr. Tannenbaum conducted a large randomized controlled trial over four years in community pharmacies in Quebec. The results of the study were recently published in JAMA.\\r\\nPatients 65 years or older were randomly assigned to one of two groups. In the intervention group, pharmacists gave both patients and their physicians educational materials on the specific drug that might have been inappropriately prescribed. Such brochures could be delivered by mail or in person. The control group got the usual care, with no educational materials.\\r\\nDrugs that were targets for deprescribing included sedatives, first-generation antihistamines, glyburide (used to treat diabetes), and certain nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, like ibuprofen or naproxen. The main outcome of interest was the ending of a prescription for one of the four medication classes six months later.\\r\\nAlmost 500 patients, average age 75, participated in the trial, and about 90 percent of them completed it. The intervention made a difference. Within six months, 43 percent of the patients in the intervention group had stopped taking one of the selected medicines. The corresponding figure was 12 percent in the control group.\\r\\nIn medicine, we often focus on the traditional doctor\/patient interaction. We tend to ignore practitioners who come into contact with patients more than physicians, who in this case could hand over brochures personally. In the study, pharmacists were also paid to send information to the patients\u2019 doctors ($19 Canadian, equivalent to $14 American, per physician outreach).  \\r\\nSimilar studies trying to enlist pharmacists are rare, but not unknown. In a 1996 study in the American Journal of Medicine that randomly assigned 208 patients, half of them had a pharmacist in a Veterans Affairs Medical Center review their medications and make recommendations to their physician. This resulted in improvements in prescriptions in 24 percent of patients versus 6 percent in usual care. \\r\\nA 1998 study published in JAMA encouraged pharmacists to contact physicians by alerts when they were employing drugs that were not ideal in the care of older people. They were able to reach physicians just over half the time and saw changes in prescriptions about a quarter of the time. This was not a controlled trial, however. \\r\\nA 2014 study in JAMA Internal Medicine focused on direct-to-consumer educational materials from pharmacists to reduce inappropriate benzodiazepine prescriptions for older people. It worked 27 percent of the time compared with 5 percent in usual care. A 2001 study in the Canadian Medical Association Journal focused on messages sent to physicians only, and found no significant changes.\\r\\nDr. Tannenbaum, author of the recent JAMA study, thought that communication was essential to her project\u2019s results: \u201cWe first asked primary care providers what information they needed to safely deprescribe patients\u2019 medications,\u201d she said. \u201cBased on the physicians\u2019 answers, we provided pharmacists with a template on how best to communicate the evidence about deprescribing to physicians. When pharmacists equipped patients with the same information, applied specifically to medications the patient had been taking for a while, everyone was on board and keen to initiate a conversation.\u201d\\r\\nOf course, this study took place in Canada, and pharmacists\u2019 scope of practice may differ in parts of the United States. The pharmacists were also reimbursed for physician contact, which might not occur in the United States. Pharmacists have seen increases in their scope, especially with respect to contraception in Oregon and California, which tend to be supported by patients as well.\\r\\nMuch like another recent study involving barbershops (and pharmacists), this study provides evidence that seemingly intractable problems can be overcome by expanding the focus of our interventions. There are many more professionals involved in health care besides physicians. They can help make health care better. \",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1705918815,\"description\":\"Are people relying too much on the traditional doctor\/patient interaction?\\r\",\"title\":\"The New Health Care: The Unsung Role of the Pharmacist in Patient Health\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"health.32.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"NEW DELHI \u2014 A new pension plan for rickshaw pullers.

Mr. Modi came to power five years ago promising to create millions of jobs for India\u2019s 1.3 billion people.\\r\\nThe latest numbers, leaked to the Indian news media this week, show that even while India\u2019s total economy has been growing, at an impressive 7 percent rate or even higher, unemployment also has been rising, hitting 6.1 percent.\\r\\nTwo top statistics commissioners resigned in protest over what appeared to be a concerted government effort to suppress the jobs report. P. C. Mohanan, a career statistician, was one of them.\\r\\nOn Friday, in an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Mohanan said it was \u201cthe responsibility of every government to bring out official statistics as public information.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cWe approved the report to be released, and it did not get released to the public after that,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no idea who decided that report will not be released.\u201d\\r\\nGovernment economists have tried to defend the decision to withhold the report, saying that it was still a draft and that the jobs data needed to be verified. Newspapers across India carried front-page articles on the controversy.\\r\\nBut on Friday, Mr. Mohanan could not have been clearer. \u201cWe approved the report,\u201d he repeated.\\r\\nHe said that the National Statistical Commission, for which he was the acting chairman, had decided months ago that the report should have been published in December.\\r\\nIndia is preparing for a hotly contested election that pits Mr. Modi and his Hindu nationalist political party against an increasingly assertive opposition led by Rahul Gandhi, the scion to a storied political dynasty. His father, Rajiv, was prime minister and so was his grandmother Indira, considered the Iron Lady of Indian politics, who loomed over this country for years. Both were assassinated.\\r\\nMr. Modi still leads in opinion polls against Rahul Gandhi, whose Indian National Congress party was deeply damaged by corruption scandals when it was in power. The party\u2019s identity as a family dynasty \u2014 Mr. Gandhi recently tapped his younger sister, Priyanka, as a party leader in a strategic state \u2014 has alienated some voters, though others seem energized by Priyanka Gandhi\u2019s entry into politics.\\r\\nShe is considered a strong public speaker and a forceful personality. The Congress party is counting on her to appeal to women across caste and religious lines.\\r\\nAs the days draw closer to the election, expected to be held in early May, the Congress party is gaining momentum. A race that once seemed a walk for Mr. Modi now seems too close to call. Indian voters are known for suddenly turning against incumbent leaders.\\r\\nIndia\u2019s political landscape is highly fragmented, like Indian society itself. In the last election, in 2014, more than a dozen political parties, rooted in caste, region or religious beliefs, won seats in Parliament.\\r\\nMost analysts believe neither Mr. Modi\u2019s party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, nor the Congress party will win an outright majority. Regional and caste-based parties will probably become the kingmakers, trading their support for central positions in the next government.\\r\\nThis is where the farmers come in. Farmers are a huge source of votes in India. More than half of India\u2019s population still depends on agriculture to survive. Recent studies show growing distress in farming communities because of population growth, shrinking plots of land, climate change and high fertilizer prices. Each year, thousands of farmers, despondent over dwindling yields and seemingly endless bills, commit suicide.\\r\\nSo few were surprised that one of the signature handouts in Mr. Modi\u2019s budget unveiled on Friday was cash payments to farmers with less than two hectares \u2014 about five acres \u2014 of land. Under the new program, small-scale farmers will get 6,000 rupees, around $85, in cash. For many farmers, 6,000 rupees is about a month\u2019s earnings.\\r\\nWorkers in the informal sector, which includes rickshaw pullers, brick layers, tea sellers, maids, drivers, watchmen and millions of others, also are to be given financial bonuses under the new budget, but it seemed Mr. Modi was especially interested in pleasing farmers.\\r\\n\u201cOur hard-working farmers were not getting the full value of their produce,\u201d Piyush Goyal, Mr. Modi\u2019s acting finance minister, said in his budget speech.\\r\\n\u201cThere is a need for providing structured income support to the poor landholder farmer families,\u201d he added. \u201cSuch support will help them in avoiding indebtedness as well and falling into clutches of money lenders.\u201d\\r\\nEven so, many farmers were critical, calling the payments insufficient.\\r\\n\u201cThey have done a crude joke to farmers,\u201d said Vijay Jawandhia, a farmer leader in Maharashtra, India\u2019s third-largest state. \u201cHow will 500 rupees per month remove the distress of farmers?\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-337178062,\"description\":\"A pension plan for rickshaw pullers.

According to Mr. Trump\u2019s posts on Twitter, they went well, \u201cwith good intent and spirit on both sides.\u201d He hosted the negotiators in the Oval Office and suggested that President Xi Jinping of China was willing to welcome more American companies and to buy more American products \u2014 including five million tons of soybeans. The Chinese representatives, led by the American-educated vice premier, Liu He, said that the two sides had made \u201cimportant progress\u201d and had \u201ccandid, specific and fruitful\u201d talks. Robert Lighthizer, the top American trade negotiator, was less sanguine. \u201cWe did not come off the rails,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s significant.\u201d\\r\\nWhat\u2019s next? The two sides hope to reach an agreement by early March, before Mr. Trump plans to increase tariffs after a 90-day truce. Mr. Lighthizer and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, will go to Beijing after the Chinese New Year holiday this month to prepare for  talks between the two presidents. Mr. Trump said that summit meeting would happen \u201cin the near future\u201d and that it would address \u201csome of the long standing and more difficult points.\u201d According to Myron Brilliant, the head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \u201cwe are in the fifth inning of a nine-inning game.\u201d He also used another sports analogy to describe the negotiations:\\r\\nI would now say we are at halftime of the Super Bowl of trade relations.\\r\\n____________________________\\r\\nToday\u2019s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.\\r\\n____________________________\\r\\nA reminder to Facebook and Google: Don\u2019t mess with Apple\\r\\nFacebook\u2019s 35,000 employees got a reminder this week of Apple\u2019s power over their day-to-day routines. So did workers at Google.\\r\\nAfter Facebook and Google ran afoul of Apple\u2019s rules for distributing apps, Apple hit back by blocking the two Silicon Valley giants from using the internal apps and updates that run on iPhone software.\\r\\nSheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, told the NYT that the offending app had not been a secret and had operated with users\u2019 consent. Apple eventually restored access for both Facebook and Google, but its point had been made: Cross us at your peril.\\r\\nThe tension with Apple was not Facebook\u2019s only concern.\\r\\n\u2022 The social network, in a collaboration with Twitter, said that other countries appeared to be following the Russian playbook for using social media to disseminate propaganda and disinformation. One campaign, from Iran, touched on the conflict in Syria and conspiracy theories about the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Facebook said it had removed 783 pages, groups and accounts with ties to Iran, while Twitter said it had taken down more than 2,000 accounts.\\r\\n\u2022 Facebook, already being investigated by the authorities in Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York, is also said to be the target of several more inquiries, including in Connecticut, Illinois and Pennsylvania, over its mishandling of user data.\\r\\nA Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank merger seems increasingly likely\\r\\nDeutsche has been in a lot of trouble for a very long time. Now, it\u2019s looking increasingly probable that the German government will step in to combine it with its smaller, but also struggling competitor, Commerzbank.\\r\\nDeutsche reported its first full-year net profit since 2014 today but still failed to meet analysts\u2019 expectations. Its fourth quarter showed continued weakness.\\r\\nThe bank has lurched through various failed restructuring efforts, has been hit with fine after fine and was recently raided by prosecutors pursuing a money-laundering investigation. Its stock price has more than halved in the past year. If it is unable to recover on its own, it is thought a merger with Commerzbank may occur by midyear.\\r\\nBut that may not be wise, writes Elisa Martinuzzi of Bloomberg:\\r\\nThe deal looks like the option of last resort. Combining two of Europe\u2019s most inefficient banks to create an even bigger supertanker would require tens of thousands of job cuts and a risky (read costly) integration to stand a chance of working.\\r\\nExpect ambiguity in the jobs data\\r\\nThe Labor Department will release its monthly estimate of hiring and unemployment at 8:30 a.m. But there\u2019s even more uncertainty than usual, writes the NYT\u2019s Ben Casselman. Here\u2019s what to look for:\\r\\nCrucial time: The United States\u2019 decade-long expansion could be nearing its end, and the partial government shutdown has added to those fears. Not all the effects will show up in the jobs data, but they will make the report unusually hard to interpret.\\r\\nPotential impact: There is one place the shutdown will probably show up: the jobless rate. Unemployment could go up by one- or two-tenths of a percentage point.\\r\\nSolid foundation: The job market is strong, however. Claims for unemployment insurance recently hit a nearly 50-year low, and paychecks are growing.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarnings reports show looming challenges\\r\\nInvestors looked to earnings reports yesterday from two bellwethers of the U.S. economy: Amazon and General Electric. Both seem to be struggling with growing pains.\\r\\nStiff competition: The latest quarterly results suggested that Amazon\u2019s retail business not only faced more competition, it was also maturing, as growth slowed from its usual breakneck pace. But the company compensated by expanding its highly profitable cloud and advertising businesses. Its revenue guidance fell short of expectations, sending shares down sharply in after-hours trading.\\r\\nSeeking a turnaround: G.E.\u2019s fourth-quarter results pointed to the depth of the company\u2019s challenges, despite a strong performance by the company\u2019s jet engine business. G.E. made no forecast for what its profit and revenue would look like this year, and its chief executive, Lawrence Culp, said that 2019 was \u201cstill very much a work in progress.\u201d The company also said that it had reached a $1.5 billion settlement in an investigation of its role in the 2008 financial crisis, reassuring investors.\\r\\nMore earnings news: Nintendo shares dropped more than 9.3 percent after it cut its full-year target for sales of its Switch video game console.\\r\\nRevolving Door\\r\\nIntel named its interim chief executive, Robert Swan, as its permanent leader, ending a seven-month search.

I learned this during a series of recent visits to WeWork locations in New York, where the throw pillows implore busy tenants to \u201cDo what you love.\u201d Neon signs demand they \u201cHustle harder,\u201d and murals spread the gospel of T.G.I.M. Even the cucumbers in WeWork\u2019s water coolers have an agenda. \u201cDon\u2019t stop when you\u2019re tired,\u201d someone recently carved into the floating vegetables\u2019 flesh. \u201cStop when you are done.\u201d Kool-Aid drinking metaphors are rarely this literal.\\r\\nWelcome to hustle culture. It is obsessed with striving, relentlessly positive, devoid of humor, and \u2014 once you notice it \u2014 impossible to escape. \u201cRise and Grind\u201d is both the theme of a Nike ad campaign and the title of a book by a \u201cShark Tank\u201d shark. New media upstarts like the Hustle, which produces a popular business newsletter and conference series, and One37pm, a content company created by the patron saint of hustling, Gary Vaynerchuk, glorify ambition not as a means to an end, but as a lifestyle.\\r\\n\u201cThe current state of entrepreneurship is bigger than career,\u201d reads the One37pm \u201cAbout Us\u201d page. \u201cIt\u2019s ambition, grit and hustle. It\u2019s a live performance that lights up your creativity \u2026 a sweat session that sends your endorphins coursing ... a visionary who expands your way of thinking.\u201d From this point of view, not only does one never stop hustling \u2014 one never exits a kind of work rapture, in which the chief purpose of exercising or attending a concert is to get inspiration that leads back to the desk.\\r\\nRyan Harwood, the chief executive of One37pm\u2019s parent company, told me that the site\u2019s content is aimed at a younger generation of people who are seeking permission to follow their dreams. \u201cThey want to know how to own their moment, at any given moment,\u201d he said.\\r\\n\u201cOwning one\u2019s moment\u201d is a clever way to rebrand \u201csurviving the rat race.\u201d In the new work culture, enduring or even merely liking one\u2019s job is not enough. Workers should love what they do, and then promote that love on social media, thus fusing their identities to that of their employers. Why else would LinkedIn build its own version of Snapchat Stories?\\r\\nThis is toil glamour, and it is going mainstream. Most visibly, WeWork \u2014 which investors recently valued at $47 billion \u2014 is on its way to becoming the Starbucks of office culture. It has exported its brand of performative workaholism to 27 countries, with 400,000 tenants, including workers from 30 percent of the Global Fortune 500.\\r\\nIn January, WeWork\u2019s founder, Adam Neumann, announced that his start-up was rebranding itself as the We Company, to reflect an expansion into residential real estate and education. Describing the shift, Fast Company wrote: \u201cRather than just renting desks, the company aims to encompass all aspects of people\u2019s lives, in both physical and digital worlds.\u201d The ideal client, one imagines, is someone so enamored of the WeWork office aesthetic \u2014 whip-cracking cucumbers and all \u2014 that she sleeps in a WeLive apartment, works out at a Rise by We gym, and sends her children to a WeGrow school.\\r\\nFrom this vantage, \u201cOffice Space,\u201d the Gen-X slacker paean that came out 20 years ago next month, feels like science fiction from a distant realm. It\u2019s almost impossible to imagine a start-up worker bee of today confessing, as protagonist Peter Gibbons does, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m lazy. It\u2019s that I just don\u2019t care.\u201d Workplace indifference just doesn\u2019t have a socially acceptable hashtag.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u2018It\u2019s grim and exploitative\u2019\\r\\nIt\u2019s not difficult to view hustle culture as a swindle. After all, convincing a generation of workers to beaver away is convenient for those at the top.\\r\\n\u201cThe vast majority of people beating the drums of hustle-mania are not the people doing the actual work. They\u2019re the managers, financiers and owners,\u201d said David Heinemeier Hansson, the co-founder of Basecamp, a software company. We spoke in October, as he was promoting his new book, \u201cIt Doesn\u2019t Have to Be Crazy at Work,\u201d about creating healthy company cultures.\\r\\nMr. Heinemeier Hansson said that despite data showing long hours improve neither productivity nor creativity, myths about overwork persist because they justify the extreme wealth created for a small group of elite techies. \u201cIt\u2019s grim and exploitative,\u201d he said.\\r\\nElon Musk, who stands to reap stock compensation upward of $50 billion if his company, Tesla, meets certain performance levels, is a prime example of extolling work by the many that will primarily benefit him. He tweeted in November that there are easier places to work than Tesla, \u201cbut nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week.\u201d The correct number of hours \u201cvaries per person,\u201d he continued, but is \u201cabout 80 sustained, peaking about 100 at times. Pain level increases exponentially above 80.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Musk, who has more than 24 million Twitter followers, further noted that if you love what you do, \u201cit (mostly) doesn\u2019t feel like work.\u201d Even he had to soften the lie of T.G.I.M. with a parenthetical.\\r\\nArguably, the technology industry started this culture of work zeal sometime around the turn of the millennium, when the likes of Google started to feed, massage and even play doctor to its employees. The perks were meant to help companies attract the best talent \u2014 and keep employees at their desks longer. It seemed enviable enough: Who wouldn\u2019t want an employer that literally took care of your dirty laundry?\\r\\nBut today, as tech culture infiltrates every corner of the business world, its hymns to the virtues of relentless work remind me of nothing so much as Soviet-era propaganda, which promoted impossible-seeming feats of worker productivity to motivate the labor force. One obvious difference, of course, is that those Stakhanovite posters had an anticapitalist bent, criticizing the fat cats profiting from free enterprise. Today\u2019s messages glorify personal profit, even if bosses and investors \u2014 not workers \u2014 are the ones capturing most of the gains. Wage growth has been essentially stagnant for years.\\r\\nPerhaps we\u2019ve all gotten a little hungry for meaning. Participation in organized religion is falling, especially among American millennials. In San Francisco, where I live, I\u2019ve noticed that the concept of productivity has taken on an almost spiritual dimension. Techies here have internalized the idea \u2014 rooted in the Protestant work ethic \u2014 that work is not something you do to get what you want; the work itself is all. Therefore any life hack or company perk that optimizes their day, allowing them to fit in even more work, is not just desirable but inherently good.\\r\\nAidan Harper, who created a European workweek-shrinkage campaign called 4 Day Week, argues that this is dehumanizing and toxic. \u201cIt creates the assumption that the only value we have as human beings is our productivity capability \u2014 our ability to work, rather than our humanity,\u201d he told me.\\r\\nIt\u2019s cultist, Mr. Harper added, to convince workers to buy into their own exploitation with a change-the-world message. \u201cIt\u2019s creating the idea that Elon Musk is your high priest,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going into your church every day and worshiping at the altar of work.\u201d\\r\\nFor congregants of the Cathedral of Perpetual Hustle, spending time on anything that\u2019s nonwork related has become a reason to feel guilty. Jonathan Crawford, a San Francisco-based entrepreneur, told me that he sacrificed his relationships and gained more than 40 pounds while working on Storenvy, his e-commerce start-up. If he socialized, it was at a networking event. If he read, it was a business book. He rarely did anything that didn\u2019t have a \u201cdirect R.O.I.,\u201d or return on investment, for his company.\\r\\nMr. Crawford changed his lifestyle after he realized it made him miserable. Now, as an entrepreneur-in-residence at 500 Start-ups, an investment firm, he tells fellow founders to seek out nonwork-related activities like reading fiction, watching movies or playing games. Somehow this comes off as radical advice. \u201cIt\u2019s oddly eye-opening to them because they didn\u2019t realize they saw themselves as a resource to be expended,\u201d Mr. Crawford said.\\r\\nIt\u2019s easy to become addicted to the pace and stress of work in 2019. Bernie Klinder, a consultant for a large tech company, said he tried to limit himself to five 11-hour days per week, which adds up to an extra day of productivity. \u201cIf your peers are competitive, working a \u2018normal workweek\u2019 will make you look like a slacker,\u201d he wrote in an email.\\r\\nStill, he\u2019s realistic about his place in the rat race. \u201cI try to keep in mind that if I dropped dead tomorrow, all of my acrylic workplace awards would be in the trash the next day,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand my job would be posted in the paper before my obituary.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nLusty for Monday mornings\\r\\nThe logical endpoint of excessively avid work, of course, is burnout. That is the subject of a recent viral essay by the BuzzFeed cultural critic Anne Helen Petersen, which thoughtfully addresses one of the incongruities of hustle-mania in the young. Namely: If Millennials are supposedly lazy and entitled, how can they also be obsessed with killing it at their jobs?\\r\\nMillennials, Ms. Petersen argues, are just desperately striving to meet their own high expectations. An entire generation was raised to expect that good grades and extracurricular overachievement would reward them with fulfilling jobs that feed their passions. Instead, they wound up with precarious, meaningless work and a mountain of student loan debt. And so posing as a rise-and-grinder, lusty for Monday mornings, starts to make sense as a defense mechanism.\\r\\nMost jobs \u2014 even most good jobs! \u2014 are full of pointless drudgery. Most corporations let us down in some way. And yet years after the HBO satire \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d made the vacuous mission statement \u201cmaking the world a better place\u201d a recurring punch line, many companies still cheerlead the virtues of work with high-minded messaging. For example, Spotify, a company that lets you listen to music, says that its mission is \u201cto unlock the potential of human creativity.\u201d Dropbox, which lets you upload files and stuff, says its purpose is \u201cto unleash the world\u2019s creative energy by designing a more enlightened way of working.\u201d\\r\\nDavid Spencer, a professor of economics at Leeds University Business School, says that such posturing by companies, economists and politicians dates at least to the rise of mercantilism in 16th-century Europe. \u201cThere has been an ongoing struggle by employers to venerate work in ways that distract from its unappealing features,\u201d he said. But such propaganda can backfire. In 17th-century England, work was lauded as a cure for vice, Mr. Spencer said, but the unrewarding truth just drove workers to drink more.\\r\\nInternet companies may have miscalculated in encouraging employees to equate their work with their intrinsic value as human beings. After a long era of basking in positive esteem, the tech industry is experiencing a backlash both broad and fierce, on subjects from monopolistic behavior to spreading disinformation and inciting racial violence. And workers are discovering how much power they wield. In November, some 20,000 Googlers participated in a walkout protesting the company\u2019s handling of sexual abusers. Other company employees shut down an artificial intelligence contract with the Pentagon that could have helped military drones become more lethal.\\r\\nMr. Heinemeier Hansson cited the employee protests as evidence that millennial workers would eventually revolt against the culture of overwork. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t going to stand for this,\u201d he said, using an expletive, \u201cor buy the propaganda that eternal bliss lies at monitoring your own bathroom breaks.\u201d He was referring to an interview that the former chief executive of Yahoo, Marissa Mayer, gave in 2016, in which she said that working 130 hours a week was possible \u201cif you\u2019re strategic about when you sleep, when you shower, and how often you go to the bathroom.\u201d\\r\\nUltimately, workers must decide if they admire or reject this level of devotion. Ms. Mayer\u2019s comments were widely panned on social media when the interview ran, but since then, Quora users have eagerly shared their own strategies for mimicking her schedule. Likewise, Mr. Musk\u2019s \u201cpain level\u201d tweets drew plenty of critical takes, but they also garnered just as many accolades and requests for jobs.\\r\\nThe grim reality of 2019 is that begging a billionaire for employment via Twitter is not considered embarrassing, but a perfectly plausible way to get ahead. On some level, you have to respect the hustlers who see a dismal system and understand that success in it requires total, shameless buy-in. If we\u2019re doomed to toil away until we die, we may as well pretend to like it. Even on Mondays.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-727259249,\"description\":\"I saw the greatest minds of my generation log 18-hour days \u2014 and then boast about #hustle on Instagram.

At least three other people died this year while following the same superstition.\\r\\nThe taboo, which has its roots in Hinduism, is called chhaupadi, from the Nepali words meaning someone who bears an impurity. During women\u2019s periods, it bars them from touching neighbors\u2019 food or entering temples. They cannot use communal water sources or kitchen utensils. It is considered bad luck to touch them.\\r\\nInstead, women who observe the taboo are banished to mud or stone huts, some of them no bigger than closets. Each year, at least a couple of women die in these huts from exposure, animal bites or smoke inhalation after building fires to stay warm during the Himalayan winter.\\r\\nMany women who follow chhaupadi say they do so out of social pressure or guilt. Reports of sexual assault from men who prey on them while they are alone are also common.\\r\\nA 2010 Nepali government survey, which was cited in a State Department human rights report, found that 19 percent of women age 15 to 49 in the country followed chhaupadi. But in Nepal\u2019s midwestern and far western regions, some of the poorest pockets of Asia, the proportion climbed to 50 percent.\\r\\nWomen\u2019s rights activists have desperately tried to end chhaupadi. Nepal\u2019s Supreme Court banned the practice in 2005. Last August, the government went a step further and criminalized it. Anyone who forces menstruating women into huts faces up to three months in jail.\\r\\nBut the law has barely rippled through many villages in western Nepal, and activists say the police are not enforcing it.\\r\\nLast month, Amba Bohara, 35, and two of her sons \u2014 ages 7 and 9 \u2014 apparently suffocated in a menstruation hut after lighting a fire to stay warm. Nobody has been arrested in their deaths.\\r\\nOfficials said no men forced Ms. Bogati to follow chhaupadi in her village of Purbichauki, a small outpost in western Nepal. Ms. Bogati\u2019s father-in-law was dead. Her husband, Shankar, was in Malaysia for a job. She stayed more or less on her own, which complicated the task of filing charges, the police said.\\r\\n\u201cShe was alone in her house,\u201d Mr. Dhami said. \u201cTell us, who should be held responsible for this crime?\u201d\\r\\nMr. Dhami said the local government had organized more than 50 programs educating people from Ms. Bogati\u2019s district about the dangers of chhaupadi and its illegality. A few days before her death, Ms. Bogati had attended one of these programs, according to a distant relative, Dirgha Raj Bogati.\\r\\nThat did not stop her from following chhaupadi. One villager, Chandra Bogati, blamed Ms. Bogati for her death.\\r\\n\u201cShe would be alive if she had not gone to the abandoned house to follow chhaupadi and burned the fire,\u201d he said.\\r\\nActivists said they planned to demolish many menstruation huts starting next month. But Amrita Thapa, a lawmaker based in Kathmandu, Nepal\u2019s capital, said it was hard to imagine the situation improving anytime soon.\\r\\nOn a recent visit to the village where Ms. Bohara and her two children died last month, she found shocking levels of resistance.\\r\\n\u201cI realized that changing people\u2019s mind-sets and ending chhaupadi was more difficult than hardships we endured

Sicily \u2014 Italy\u2019s populist interior minister, Matteo Salvini, celebrated Parliament\u2019s passage of his Security Decree to crack down on illegal immigration by assuring his supporters last year that \u201cI won\u2019t stop!\u201d\\r\\nBut stopping Mr. Salvini is exactly what Leoluca Orlando, the mayor of Palermo, the Sicilian capital, wants to do.\\r\\nPassed with much fanfare late last year, Mr. Salvini\u2019s Security Decree was intended to make Italy more unwelcoming to migrants, not least by doing away with two years of \u201chumanitarian protection\u201d for asylum seekers, a status that allowed them to live in the country legally.\\r\\nFar from adding to security, says Mr. Orlando, 71, a veteran mayor and constitutional law professor who came to prominence in the fight against the mafia, the law risks pushing migrants into the shadows and the criminal underworld by denying them legal status as well as access to health care and other social services.\\r\\nHe has refused to apply the decree in a stand that has become a prominent part of a widening grass-roots resistance to Mr. Salvini\u2019s hard line on immigration, which is increasingly dividing the country even as it has tightened the populist government\u2019s hold on power.\\r\\nOn Friday afternoon, in defiance of the law, Mr. Orlando pushed through the first four applications by migrants seeking residency under their humanitarian status.\\r\\nBy signing their applications, Mr. Orlando hopes to invite a legal challenge by the government that he can take all the way to Italy\u2019s highest court. He intends to argue that Mr. Salvini\u2019s measures are unconstitutional and violate the migrants\u2019 human rights.\\r\\n\u201cI cannot accept that you produce criminality,\u201d Mr. Orlando said in an interview last month in his grand office, surrounded by gilded Islamic manuscripts, a letter from Pope Francis and a paperweight of the Dalai Lama.\\r\\nMany liberal mayors across the country, from Naples to Florence to Milan, applauded Mr. Orlando\u2019s intention to defy the government, which he first announced at the end of December.\\r\\nMr. Orlando\u2019s office now hopes his action will clear the way for the mayors to create Italian versions of the sanctuary cities that sprouted in the United States in opposition to President\u2019s Trump\u2019s similarly minded crackdown on immigration.\\r\\nThis week, Tuscany, Umbria, Sardinia and the northern region of Piedmont filed a legal complaint against the Security Decree, charging that it actually increased criminal activity and decreased the possibility of economic integration.\\r\\nIn a further knock on the government, prosecutors in Sicily initiated an investigation of Mr. Salvini on charges of \u201ckidnapping,\u201d after his refusal to allow an Italian Coast Guard ship carrying migrants to dock this summer.\\r\\nIn the absence of plausible political opposition at the national level, some have welcomed the signs of resistance against the government led by Mr. Salvini\u2019s anti-immigrant League and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement.\\r\\n\u201cThere are many little outbreaks that have failed to form in a single flame,\u201d said Claudio Cerasa, the author of a manual on resistance to Italy\u2019s culture of intolerance and the editor of Il Foglio, a newspaper critical of the government.\\r\\nBut the flickers of resistance have only inflamed Mr. Salvini, who clearly thinks he has a winning position ahead of critical European Parliament elections in May. He continues to find evermore inventive ways to ratchet up his crack down on illegal migration.\\r\\nMr. Salvini has embraced the investigation aimed at him as an opportunity to play the victim of overreaching magistrates. He has already attacked the civilly disobedient mayors as scofflaws who \u201chelp the illegal migrants hate Italians, and they will answer to the law and to history.\u2019\u2019\\r\\n\u2018\u2018I will not stop,\u201d he pledged.\\r\\nIndeed, last month, Mr. Salvini refused to offer a safe port to the Sea Watch 3, a vessel that had rescued 47 migrants from the Mediterranean Sea. For nearly two weeks, the ship was adrift as Mr. Salvini spoke of forming a \u201cnaval blockade\u201d to seal off the country.\\r\\nThe standoff ended on Thursday, only after European neighbors agreed to take in the majority of the migrants, who disembarked in another Sicilian city, Catania.\\r\\nThe repeating loop of ships approaching Italy with rescued migrants, only to be turned away by Mr. Salvini, has given the tough-talking interior minister a seemingly inexhaustible well of talking points and advantageous television footage.\\r\\n\u201cI guarantee that our position will not change: Zero Tolerance\u201d Mr. Salvini posted on Twitter Thursday, adding later that millions of Italians \u201cvoted for me to BLOCK THE LANDINGS.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Orlando accused Mr. Salvini of fear-mongering and \u201cusing the banner of security to get votes in the next European election.\u201d\\r\\nHis decision, which his office said is based on his reading of Italian law, breaks a bureaucratic impasse with city workers who, unlike him, were loath to defy Mr. Salvini\u2019s decree. It sets off a process that will likely result this month in the mayor personally granting residency to the applicants.\\r\\n\u201cThis is the first concrete act of opposition,\u201d said Mr. Orlando, who is eager for Italy\u2019s highest court to rule on Mr. Salvini\u2019s law. \u201cI need a court!\u201d\\r\\nIn the meantime, migrants around Italy are feeling the pressure.\\r\\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Saha Abdul, 21, a migrant from Ghana, said as he shopped in the Ballar\u00f2 market in the center of Palermo. He said he had tried to renew his documents to gain residency in Italy, but was told the decree made that impossible.\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019m already on the street. Everything is in my bag \u2014 water, food,\u2019\u2019 he lamented. \u2018\u2018I get no help. It will push people to do what people don\u2019t want to do.\u201d\\r\\nAt the University of Palermo, a group of 10 lawyers and law students offered free counsel to migrants thrown in disarray by the new decree. Outside of a classroom, lawyers worked off a call list with the names Sakko, Konate, Camara and Bolul.\\r\\nMigrants who arrived in Italy as minors \u2014 attending Italian schools, learning the language and integrating in their cities \u2014 often counted on the humanitarian status to remain in Italy when they came of age. Instead, many risked suddenly becoming illegal as they turned 18.\\r\\nAlieu Sosseh, 17, said his application for a residency permit had been postponed until later this month.\\r\\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why. I\u2019m not trying to do something bad in this country. I have been going to school,\u201d he said, worried that people in his situation will eventually be forced to start dealing drugs.\\r\\n\u201cIn life when you can\u2019t get your meals \u2014 your breakfast \u2014 and that is the only opportunity, you can get involved in that thing,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018You won\u2019t like it, but you have no choice.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Salvini\u2019s critics say that is exactly the outcome he desires. By producing more migrant crime, they say, he produces more anxiety and fear, exactly the conditions on which his law-and-order proposals feed.\\r\\nBut Mr. Salvini argues that the mayors and other liberals are simply making excuses for migrants, who they prefer over law-abiding Italian citizens.\\r\\nActing on the authority of Mr. Salvini\u2019s Security Decree, the police last week cleared out an integration center in Castelnuovo di Porto, north of Rome. Mr. Salvini said the closure of such centers, where about 6,000 refugee applicants across the country receive shelter, would save the state about six million euros.\\r\\nMr. Salvini pledged to carry out a similar evacuation of an even larger center in Sicily later this year.\\r\\nSuch moves continue to divide Italians.

The bad news is that your next upgrade will probably cost a lot more.\\r\\nConsider that last year, Apple raised prices for most of its products. They included its iPhones, Apple Watch, Mac Mini, MacBook Air and iPad Pro. (Yes, that is nearly the company\u2019s entire gadget lineup.) Apple has said the increases were necessary because the products had become more complex and expensive to make.\\r\\nTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, defended the iPhone\u2019s rising prices in an interview with \u201cGood Morning America\u201d in September. He said the iPhone was an all-in-one gadget replacing cameras and music players, among other gizmos. \\r\\n\u201cWe found that people want to have the most innovative product available, and with that, it\u2019s not cheap to do that,\u201d he said.\\r\\nThat justification did not add up for me. Since the iPhone\u2019s debut in 2007, it had been a multifunctional device that continually incorporated cutting-edge features without significant price increases. The same went for Apple\u2019s watches, computers and tablets: They became more advanced over the years without big price jumps \u2014 until now.\\r\\nAnd there is a question of whether Apple has pushed prices up too high. On Tuesday, the company \u2014 while dealing with reports about an embarrassing privacy glitch that let iPhone users eavesdrop on one another\u2019s microphones \u2014 reported disappointing financial results. In a letter warning investors before the quarterly earnings report, Apple acknowledged that iPhone sales may have slowed because of factors including higher prices.\\r\\nFor a reality check on Apple\u2019s pricing, I spoke to financial experts and pricing strategists. I learned that there is credence to Apple\u2019s arguments: Its products do cost more to produce than in years past. But that didn\u2019t stop me from consulting with Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews products and tracks deals, for advice on how we could shave the costs of our next Apple upgrades.\\r\\nHere\u2019s what I found.\\r\\nHow and why Apple raised prices\\r\\nLast year, Apple\u2019s prices shot up by 7 percent to 60 percent, depending on the product. Perhaps the most notable increase was for the new Mac Mini, which costs about $800, up from $500. (The last Mac Mini debuted in 2014.) \\r\\nSome Apple prices stayed firm or declined. Notably, the newer entry-level iPad is selling for about $330, down from $500 in years past.\\r\\nBut in general, prices jumped. That was surprising given that product costs typically fall as technologies mature and parts become widely available, which was what happened with televisions.\\r\\nThe more I examined the pricing, though, the more evidence there was that the latest Apple products are more expensive to make. Apple also appears to be under pressure to introduce more complex innovations to compete in the brutal technology market.\\r\\nTake a look at the company\u2019s gross profit margin, or the money it makes from products after the cost to make and sell them is factored in. If Apple\u2019s gross margins are lower today even though prices are higher, that indicates the products cost more to make. \\r\\nAnd that is indeed the case. Toni Sacconaghi, a financial analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein who has studied Apple for years, estimated that the company\u2019s gross margins for the iPhone were below 40 percent, down from more than 50 percent several years ago. \\r\\nMr. Sacconaghi said the shrinking margins demonstrated how tough it had become to compete in the technology market. Apple has had to add features like stronger metals, sophisticated cameras, high-resolution displays, advanced chips and faster wireless connectivity while trimming back on some profit given that rival products from the likes of Xiaomi, Huawei and Lenovo have become very capable. If Apple had wanted to keep profit margins consistent with past years, he said, it would have had to raise prices even higher and risk losing sales.\\r\\n\u201cYou have to put in more to stay competitive, or you\u2019re going to lose share,\u201d he said.\\r\\nJared Wiesel, a partner at Revenue Analytics, a pricing and sales consulting firm, said Apple was still in a unique position to introduce broad price increases. Other companies, such as grocery brands, lack the clout to do so because their competitors might undercut them and lure away customers.\\r\\n\u201cThey\u2019re in the very enviable position that they can, by and large, take major action across the board without, so far, seeing a major erosion of loyalty as a result,\u201d Mr. Wiesel said.\\r\\nAn Apple spokeswoman referred to Mr. Cook\u2019s comments on Tuesday\u2019s earnings call. In response to a question about whether Apple had raised prices too high, Mr. Cook said the prices were not that much more. He noted that the iPhone XS was the same price as last year's iPhone X, and that the XR was priced only slightly higher than the iPhone 8.\\r\\nHow to save on Apple gear\\r\\nDiscounts for new Apple products are rare. But here are several methods to lower the cost of your next purchase.\\r\\nOne simple way to get some cash toward your next purchase is to take your old devices to a trade-in program at a retailer or a wireless store. Apple runs Apple GiveBack, which gives you Apple Store credit in exchange for an old phone, tablet, computer or smart watch. Gazelle, an online reseller, will let you sell smartphones, tablets and Macs in exchange for cash or Amazon store credit. Carriers like AT&T and Verizon Wireless offer trade-in programs. And Best Buy stores also provide store credit for many used devices. \\r\\nThe best part about the release of a new Apple product is that last year\u2019s model can be had for cheaper. Apple now sells the iPhone 8, still a very good phone, for about $600, down from its original $700 price. \\r\\nOlder-generation Apple Watches and tablets occasionally go on sale during holiday shopping periods such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Wirecutter said. In November, the Apple Watch Series 3 dropped to $200 on Amazon, down from the original $330.\\r\\nTo scout for deals, you can create alerts for price drops using web tools like Camel Camel Camel. Wirecutter also runs a webpage that regularly highlights deals.\\r\\nApple product discounts tend to be better when you buy through third parties like Best Buy and Amazon. \\r\\n\u201cThe best tip is to shop around before going to the Apple Store,\u201d said Alex Roth, a commerce editor for Wirecutter.\\r\\nTrusted brands like Apple, Best Buy and Amazon offer programs to buy refurbished or used products. \\r\\nRefurbished products typically were returned by a consumer and then restored to excellent condition, and they often include a fresh battery and warranty. Apple\u2019s online store for refurbished products lists last year\u2019s iPad Pro for about $550, down from about $650.\\r\\nBuying used Apple gadgets can often yield more savings, but you will have to be judicious about whom you buy from. Your best bet is to buy from a friend, a relative or a reseller that is a trusted brand. I have had consistently good experiences buying used products from Amazon\u2019s Warehouse program, for example.\\r\\nOf course, you can save $750 on the next $750 iPhone by not buying it at all. The most thrifty thing you can do is to maintain your device and skip upgrading. \\r\\nPlenty of Apple customers have caught on to this approach. The company acknowledged in its recent note to investors that many iPhone customers took advantage of its battery replacement program, which may have contributed to slower sales of replacements.\\r\\nThere\u2019s a hidden benefit to giving your devices some tender loving care.\\r\\n\u201cTake good care of the one you have so that when the time comes for an upgrade, you can trade that one in and you\u2019ll get something for it,\u201d Mr. Roth said.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1441898756,\"description\":\"If recent increases are any indication, chances are your next iDevice will cost even more.

But while two recent proposals sound simple enough, they could be difficult to put into effect.\\r\\nAnd if the experience with the alternative minimum tax is any guide, using tax policy to target one group can backfire.\\r\\nOne tax proposal comes from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a new Democratic congresswoman from New York who has said that an increase in income taxes could help fund other initiatives, like work on climate change. She said in an interview on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that the rate on earnings over $10 million could be 60 or 70 percent, up from the current rate of 37 percent. This tax, on what she called the \u201ctippy tops\u201d of earners, would be graduated like the rest of the income code, so only a portion of the millionaires\u2019 income would be taxed at that high rate.\\r\\nAnd Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat preparing for a presidential campaign, has proposed a wealth tax of 2 percent on people with a net worth above $50 million and 3 percent on those with a net worth over $1 billion.\\r\\nMs. Warren worked with Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, two respected economists at the University of California, Berkeley, whose research focuses on income inequality. They estimated that such a tax would raise $2.75 trillion over 10 years, which sounds like a lot but would account for just 1 percent of gross domestic product.\\r\\nThe devil, though, is in the details.\\r\\nSuch targeted tax policies have often been riddled with loopholes, as was the case with the highest marginal tax rates in the 1970s; become overly complex to enact, like the alternative minimum tax; or created unintended consequences that affected taxpayers beyond those originally intended.\\r\\nMs. Warren\u2019s wealth tax, for example, has three major challenges.\\r\\nFirst, there is a huge gap in wealth between $50 million and $1 billion. There are far more people with wealth in the tens and hundreds of millions of dollars in the United States \u2014 39,735, according to Wealth-X, which tracks wealth in the world \u2014 than there are billionaires \u2014 680 \u2014 who would pay the higher 3 percent tax.\\r\\nIf raising revenue is the object, increasing the tax rate for people at several intervals between $50 million and $1 billion, which are very different levels of wealth, would bring in more revenue, wealth experts said.\\r\\nAs it stands, billionaires would contribute just $300 billion of the $2.75 trillion the higher rates are projected to raise over 10 years. Adding in rates would also allow Ms. Warren to increase the rate again for billionaires.\\r\\nA bigger issue is that a wealth tax may not be constitutional. The 16th Amendment provides only for an income tax. The estate, gift and generation-skipping taxes pass muster because they\u2019re deemed excise taxes on the transfer of wealth, not on the wealth itself.\\r\\n\u201cSenator Warren\u2019s proposal is based on a study by two scholars, and she\u2019s pursuing that,\u201d said Joanne Johnson, head of wealth advisory group at J. P. Morgan\u2019s private bank. \u201cThere is a lot of extremely important analysis that still has to occur.\u201d\\r\\nA third issue is logistical. A wealth tax would be like an estate tax levied every year. Figuring out the tax owed on large estates is complicated, costly and time-consuming. The Internal Revenue Service gives estates a year to file a return, but even then, executors often have to file extensions. And on the other end, auditors go through the returns, which can take years before an estate is settled.\\r\\nThe process requires not just lawyers and accountants but valuation experts who assess the worth of assets like closely held family businesses.\\r\\n\u201cIt would be a highly cumbersome tax return to prepare on an annual basis,\u201d said Jeff Moes, executive vice president and chief fiduciary officer at FineMark National Bank & Trust, which serves high-net-worth clients. \u201cEvery federal estate tax goes through an audit, and presumably this would go through an audit as well. They\u2019d have to figure out if the valuation methodology is correct.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cA billionaire would have a return that would be literally three feet high,\u201d he added. \u201cOur $100 million clients own multiple closely held businesses. All of them would require an expert valuation and five-year financials.\u201d\\r\\nAnd then the government would need to have enough auditors to verify everything that was submitted. In 2018, for example, an estimated 4,000 estate tax returns will be filed, with tax owed on 1,900 of them. That\u2019s a tenth the number of tax returns that would be filed under Ms. Warren\u2019s wealth tax plan.\\r\\nAs for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s idea, many economists have noted that a rate of 70 percent for the highest tax bracket has been in place before. But the tax environment in the 1970s was different from today\u2019s. (That top marginal kicked in at $200,000, or roughly $800,000 in today\u2019s dollars.)\\r\\nBack then, people could average their income over several years to reduce the large tax bite. There were also far more deductions that people could take than there are now.\\r\\nMaury Cartine, a partner at the accounting firm Marcum and a certified public accountant for 50 years, said that when the highest tax bracket was 70 percent in the 1970s, the tax on earned income \u2014 as opposed to investment income \u2014 was limited to 50 percent. At that time, an individual taxpayer could also deduct interest on any type of loan \u2014 car, educational, credit card \u2014 and not just on a home.\\r\\n\u201cA taxpayer could refinance appreciated rental property, take the proceeds to buy a yacht or some very nice jewelry and still deduct the interest,\u201d Mr. Cartine said.\\r\\nThese deductions have been whittled away over the years. And in the current tax code, even deductions like those on state and local taxes or mortgage interest have been eliminated or curtailed. In other words, a 70 percent rate would be a much higher rate today, given the limited deductions, than it was in the 1970s.\\r\\nIt\u2019s also worth looking back at the unintended consequences from similar policy-driven tax proposals.\\r\\nThe alternative minimum tax was started in a different form in 1969. It was largely meant to target the 155 Americans who had incomes over $200,000 (roughly more than $1 million today) and hadn\u2019t paid any income tax. It was reformulated in 1982 but never indexed to inflation.\\r\\nSo as incomes rose, more and more affluent people were hit by the tax, which reduced deductions and set a minimum tax rate of 26 and 28 percent. Affluent professionals living in areas with high property and state taxes that could be deducted, like the Northeast, were often subject to it.\\r\\nTimothy Speiss, partner in charge of the personal wealth advisers group at EisnerAmper, an accounting firm, said that by 2017, the alternative minimum tax had affected more affluent people than the truly wealthy.\\r\\nThe Tax Policy Center noted that 27 percent of people earning $200,000 to $500,000 and 62 percent of people earning $500,000 to $1 million paid more in taxes in 2017 because of the tax, while only 20 percent of people earning more than $1 million paid higher taxes.\\r\\nA simpler example of unintended consequences is what\u2019s called the loss carry-forward provision. It allows people to deduct up to $3,000 a year in investment losses against their ordinary income. Yet that $3,000 was set in 1978, when it was worth significantly more and fewer people were broadly invested in financial markets through their retirement plans. It hasn\u2019t been adjusted in 40 years.\\r\\n\u201cAny parameter that is not indexed to inflation automatically creates unintended consequences as more people become subject to it,\u201d said Gil Charney, director of the Tax Institute at H & R Block. \u201cIt\u2019s also another example of the marriage penalty. It\u2019s $3,000 per return, not per person.\u201d\\r\\nLate this past week, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a potential Democratic presidential candidate, took a different tack in taxing the rich. He proposed applying an estate tax with a top rate of 77 percent for estates exceeding $1 billion.\\r\\nHow Senator Warren\u2019s or Representative Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s proposal would work rests as much on proper execution as on the definition of wealthy.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1858430965,\"description\":\"Two Democrats have proposed taxing the richest Americans at a higher rate.

Now, as China\u2019s economy slows, it has become a symbol of their new sense of caution.\\r\\nThe company, China\u2019s largest e-commerce business, said on Wednesday that its earnings growth fell last quarter. Its revenue was slightly below analysts\u2019 expectations, growing 41 percent, its slowest pace since early 2016, reflecting both the sheer size of the company and widening troubles in the Chinese economy, the world\u2019s second largest.\\r\\nAlibaba\u2019s shares rose in premarket trading, however, because it beat analysts\u2019 estimates on adjusted earnings per share, posting growth of 15 percent.\\r\\nLast week, China posted its slowest quarterly growth reading in a decade. Retail sales growth has similarly slowed, though it picked up a bit in December, and private-sector wage growth is down to global financial crisis levels. Middle-class Chinese people are increasingly cutting back.\\r\\nPurchases of big-ticket items like cars and smartphones have fallen off especially quickly. Apple said on Tuesday that profits were flat and revenues were down in its most recent quarter, in part because of weakness in sales in China. Data from the research firm Canalys showed that smartphone sales in China had fallen 14 percent in 2018, to their lowest levels since 2013.\\r\\nDuring an earnings call, Alibaba executives sought to play down concerns about the Chinese economy and the smoldering trade war between Beijing and Washington. Joseph C. Tsai, the company\u2019s executive vice chairman, said Alibaba\u2019s exposure to the trade war was low, and he emphasized that e-commerce had generally grown much faster than China\u2019s economy.\\r\\n\u201cThe slowdown of macro might cause concerns in the market; however, what we see from Alibaba\u2019s platforms is Chinese consumption growth is still strong,\u201d Alibaba\u2019s chief executive, Daniel Zhang, said. He added that although there had been weakness in sales of goods like appliances and smartphones, other sectors, like apparel and home furnishing, had had fast growth.\\r\\nAlibaba has suffered, however. Its shares have fallen about 16 percent in the past six months. It has also cut its estimate of revenue growth for the current fiscal year, which ends in March, by about 5 percent. On its blowout Singles Day sale in November, Alibaba sales grew from a year earlier, but also at a much slower rate. A bike-sharing company it backed, Ofo, has also fallen into trouble, and millions of users are demanding deposits back.\\r\\n\u201cWe expect a tougher macroeconomic outlook for China to weigh on Alibaba\u2019s commissions and advertising revenue for the next few quarters,\u201d said Shelleen Shum, an analyst with the research firm eMarketer, in a report.\\r\\nWith hundreds of millions of customers regularly using its online shopping websites, Alibaba is a good barometer of consumer sentiment. But just as important, the bulk of the company\u2019s earnings come from advertisements bought by the many vendors and companies that sell on its websites, making it also a good proxy for business confidence.\\r\\nMany sellers have remained cautious, in part because of economic uncertainties, leading to a buildup in Alibaba\u2019s ad inventories, according to a report by Credit Suisse.\\r\\nTo push back, Alibaba has looked to recruit new users, often from China\u2019s rural areas, who are less well served by e-commerce. Efforts to attract users via digital media like online videos and domestic social media sites dragged on the company\u2019s profitability, analysts said.\\r\\nThe company has continued to add consumers. It said its monthly active users on mobile devices had risen to 699 million, an addition of more than 30 million from the previous quarter. Analysts have said such user growth shows Alibaba still has room to grow by spreading out further into China\u2019s countryside.\\r\\nAt the World Economic Forum meeting this month in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Tsai, Alibaba\u2019s executive vice chairman, also warned about the long-term economic impact of the trade war between the United States and China. Still, he said the trade deficit between China and the United States would naturally fall as Chinese consumers spent more on overseas goods.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":51690786,\"description\":\"The e-commerce giant posted numbers that pale in comparison to earlier surging figures, a sign of the country\u2019s economic slowdown.\\r\",\"title\":\"Alibaba, an Icon of China\u2019s Growth, Now Reflects Its Slowdown\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"technology.27.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here\u2019s the sign-up.) \\r\\nGood evening. Here\u2019s the latest.\\r\\n1. The Midwest is about to experience weather whiplash as parts of the region could see temperatures rise by 70 degrees within a few days.\\r\\nThe bitter cold lifted in the region after days of dangerously low temperatures left at least 29 dead and cities at a standstill. Detroit, above, hovered near zero degrees. But the thaw is setting in. The Chicago area may see a jarring 73-degree jump, from minus 21 on Thursday to possibly 52 on Monday.\\r\\nThe temperature swing will bring some relief and give cities and towns a chance to assess the damage. But it also brings a new set of worries: potholes, clogs, flooding and ice jams.\\r\\n_____\\r\\n2. President Trump wanted to talk.\\r\\nHe initially invited A. G. Sulzberger, the publisher of The Times, to an off-the record dinner. Mr. Sulzberger declined, and instead requested an on-the-record interview including Times reporters.\\r\\nWhat followed was an 85-minute interview on a range of topics, in which the president said he was moving forward with a wall along the southwestern border, brushed off investigations that have ensnared his administration, and sized up the 2020 competition. Here\u2019s what our reporters learned from the exchange.\\r\\nDuring the interview in the Oval Office, above, Mr. Sulzberger questioned Mr. Trump about his attacks on the press. The president called himself \u201ca victim\u201d of unfair coverage.\\r\\n_____\\r\\n3. The U.S. suspended one of the last Cold War nuclear arms control treaties with Russia, setting the stage for a possible new arms race.\\r\\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the suspension of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty,  after years of insistence that Moscow violated the Reagan-era agreement, declaring that \u201ccountries must be held accountable when they break the rules.\u201d\\r\\nBut the Trump administration\u2019s real aim is China: Constrained by the treaty\u2019s provisions, the United States has been prevented from deploying new weapons to counter China\u2019s efforts in the Western Pacific.\\r\\n_____\\r\\n4. Representatives Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, above,and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, the House\u2019s first two Muslim women, have been celebrated as symbols of diversity. But on Israel, they have exposed a divide within the Democratic Party.\\r\\nThe debate pits the stalwart supporters of Israel against a wing of young liberals like Ms. Tlaiband Ms. Omar \u2014 including many young Jews \u2014 who are willing to accuse Israel of human rights abuses and demand movement toward a Palestinian state.\\r\\nThe tussle will take center stage next week as the Senate takes up a bill aimed to curb the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions, or B.D.S., movement, which is intended to pressure Israel into ending the occupation of the West Bank. The bill is also intended to stifle voices like Ms. Tlaib and Ms. Omar that back it. It is expected to pass easily.\\r\\n_____\\r\\n5. Today in 2020 news: Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey is the latest Democrat to jump into a presidential race that could include one of the most diverse primary fields in history.\\r\\nMr. Booker, the former mayor of Newark, is hoping to run on his signature upbeat message. In an early-morning email to supporters, the senator laid out his vision for a country that will \u201cchannel our common pain back into our common purpose.\u201d\\r\\nIn other 2020 developments, Senator Elizabeth Warren apologized for her decision to take a DNA test to prove her Native American ancestry. The apology came as Ms. Warren is set to formally kick off her presidential run this month.\\r\\n_____\\r\\n6. The U.S. economy added 304,000 jobs in January as employers appeared to shrug off the government shutdown.\\r\\nJanuary\u2019s growth means that American employers have added jobs for 100 consecutive months, a record run. Unemployment ticked up to 4 percent, possibly a shutdown-related anomaly. Above, a T.S.A. agent working through the shutdown in January.\\r\\n\u201cThis jobs report is showing no evidence of an economy slowing, certainly not falling into recession,\u201d one economist said.\\r\\nOne industry did not fare as well: digital media. More than 1,000 employees were laid off at BuzzFeed, Vice, AOL, Yahoo and HuffPost in recent days. We take a look at what went wrong.\\r\\nSeparately, Foxconn said it was moving forward with a Wisconsin plant after talking to President Trump. It previously sent mixed signals.\\r\\n_____\\r\\n7. Seven manufacturers of pelvic mesh are paying $8 billion to resolve more than 100,000 claims from women. But lawyers have found ways to take big chunks of their payouts.\\r\\nA decade ago, doctors were quick to implant synthetic mesh to deal with urinary issues. But when women began complaining of complications, lawyers signed up patients by the thousands to file claims against the manufacturers. It turned into one of the biggest federal court litigations in United States history.\\r\\nBut the average settlement is less than $60,000, which dwindles after retainer agreements allow lawyers to recoup 45 percent of the settlements they negotiated, plus reimbursement for expenses including private jet travel.\\r\\n_____\\r\\n8. Much of this weekend\u2019s sports news will be dominated by talk of the Los Angeles Rams\u2019 young coach, Sean McVay, and New England\u2019s favorite adopted son, Tom Brady, above.\\r\\nBut before we get to Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl LIII, the lead-up to this year\u2019s contest has no shortage of drama. We take an illustrative look at how we got here.\\r\\nWhatever jersey you\u2019re wearing, you\u2019re going to need food. Or if you\u2019re just here for the snacks, we\u2019ve got you covered, too, with our best Super Bowl recipes.\\r\\nWant to read about the Superb Owl? You\u2019re not alone.\\r\\n_____\\r\\n9. Scott Joplin, a pianist and ragtime master. Zelda Wynn Valdes, a fashion designer who outfitted the stars of screen and stage. Gladys Bentley, a gender-bending blues performer.\\r\\nThese remarkable black men and women never received obituaries in The New York Times \u2014 until now. We\u2019re adding their stories, along with 10 others, to our project about prominent people whose deaths were not reported by the newspaper.\\r\\nThe series is continuing, and will continue to expand its lens. Think we\u2019re forgetting someone? We want your Black History Month suggestions.\\r\\n_____\\r\\n10. Finally, we end the day with Day-Glo flying squirrels.\\r\\nOne spring night, a biologist saw a hot-pink squirrel fly by while he was outside with his ultraviolet flashlight. He wasn\u2019t seeing things: A new study found that three species of flying squirrel turn hot-pink under ultraviolet illumination.\\r\\nScientists are still studying why the squirrels turn this vivid color. It could be ecologically significant to the species, one researcher said, or \u201cit could just be a cool color that they happen to produce.\u201d\\r\\nHave a vibrant weekend.\\r\\n_____\\r\\nYour Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.\\r\\nAnd don\u2019t miss Your Morning Briefing.

The central bank did not raise its benchmark rate at its first meeting of 2019, and said it had no plans to raise rates in the foreseeable future.\\r\\nThe Fed\u2019s newfound patience delighted the White House, and Wall Street. It was seen as a concession to the Fed\u2019s critics, and as a boost for an economic expansion that is on the verge of becoming the longest in the nation\u2019s modern history.\\r\\n\u201cWe have, by far, the strongest economy in the world!\u201d Mr. Trump exulted Friday morning on Twitter.\\r\\nBut the details of the Fed\u2019s decision suggest less cause for celebration.\\r\\nJerome H. Powell, the Fed\u2019s chairman, said Wednesday that the Fed was pausing not because it embraced Mr. Trump\u2019s argument that the economy was in ruddy health, but because the expansion faced growing threats, including from the impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s own policies.\\r\\nAmong these, Mr. Powell listed the trade war with China and the risk of another government shutdown.\\r\\nIn effect, the Fed concluded the expansion might not survive the combination of more rate increases and Mr. Trump\u2019s economic policies, so it pulled off the road to reduce the risk of a crash.\\r\\nFor the moment, of course, there is little practical difference between the White House view that rates should stay low because the economy is strong and the Fed view that rates should remain low because the economy is fragile. The tension will resume if growth revives.\\r\\nThe Fed\u2019s shift also stopped well short of the president\u2019s stated preferences.\\r\\nThe central bank still raised rates four times in 2018, in the face of Mr. Trump\u2019s warnings, and Mr. Powell said Wednesday that he thought those increases were warranted. Friday\u2019s report that the economy added 304,000 jobs in January suggests that the Fed hasn\u2019t yet choked the economy.\\r\\nThe Fed similarly stopped short of accepting Mr. Trump\u2019s advice that it should \u201cstop with the 50Bs,\u201d referring to its policy of reducing its bond portfolio by about $50 billion each month.\\r\\nWhile saying it would continue reducing its holdings for now, the Fed was at pains to reassure investors that it stands ready to adjust the policy as necessary and that it is likely to stop sooner than previously expected.\\r\\nMr. Trump picked Mr. Powell to serve as the Fed\u2019s chairman. But last year, as interest rates rose and the stock market declined, the president repeatedly attacked Fed policy as \u201ccrazy,\u201d \u201cwild\u201d and \u201cloco.\u201d He fretted to aides that Mr. Powell would \u201cturn me into Hoover,\u201d a reference to the president during the early years of the Great Depression, and he asked aides whether he could replace the chairman.\\r\\nMr. Trump\u2019s attacks on the Fed are not easily assembled into a coherent critique. But some lieutenants have advanced the argument that the administration\u2019s economic policies are expanding the labor force and increasing productivity, resulting in economic growth without inflation.\\r\\nIn this view, the Fed should leave interest rates at a low level to allow the expansion to continue.\\r\\n\u201cMy hope is that the Fed, under its new management, understands that more people working and faster economic growth do not cause inflation,\u201d Larry Kudlow, the head of the National Economic Council, said last year. He added that the Fed should increase interest rates \u201cvery slowly.\u201d\\r\\nAdministration officials also blamed the Fed\u2019s policies for causing the wobbles in financial markets last year.\\r\\nMr. Powell, by contrast, said on Wednesday that the economic outlook was deteriorating for reasons unrelated to the Fed\u2019s policies. He pointed to storm clouds including economic weakness in China and Europe and tightening financial conditions, as well as the impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies.\\r\\nHe made the nuanced point that the Fed still regards solid economic growth as the most likely outcome for the coming year but that result is now somewhat less likely.\\r\\n\u201cAt such times, common-sense risk management suggests patiently awaiting greater clarity,\u201d he said.\\r\\nThe persistent sluggishness of inflation, which has remained below the Fed\u2019s preferred 2 percent annual pace since the 2008 crisis, also played a role. Mr. Powell said the Fed had the luxury of being patient because the risk of higher inflation \u201cappears to have diminished.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cIt seems to me that what\u2019s happened is the Fed is saying, \u2018We\u2019re more concerned now about the secular stagnation issues than inflation at this moment,\u2019\u201d said Lewis Alexander, the chief United States economist at Nomura. \u201cAnd I think to be perfectly frank that\u2019s a perfectly reasonable place for them to be.\u201d\\r\\nAnalysts said the negative reaction of financial markets after the Fed\u2019s previous meeting, in December, was a particularly important factor. The Fed raised rates and predicted two more increases in 2019. Mr. Powell also emphasized the Fed\u2019s commitment to reducing bond holdings, which some investors saw as overly aggressive.\\r\\n\u201cThey were planning on roaring forward with this balance sheet roll-off, and the market is like: \u2018Oh, my God! That will crush the economy!\u2019\u201d said Julia Coronado, a former Fed economist and the president of MacroPolicy Perspectives. \u201cAnd so they recalibrated. Good.\u201d\\r\\nMohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser at the financial firm Allianz, said the Fed\u2019s decision Wednesday \u201ccame as absolutely no surprise.\u201d Since the global financial crisis, he said, the Fed has backed down each time investors objected to the tightening of monetary policy.\\r\\nAmong those moments: the 2013 \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d and the decision to postpone rate increases in 2016.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s watching the same movie over and over again,\u201d he said.\\r\\nThe question, Mr. El-Erian said, is whether the Fed should be listening to the markets.\\r\\n\u201cIf you believe that the market is signaling something genuine about the economy that the Fed has not yet understood, then it\u2019s not a bad thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIf, however, you believe that the market has gotten used to having the Fed as its rich uncle, then this is a bad thing.\u201d\\r\\nSome Fed officials appear more receptive to the kind of arguments advanced by Mr. Kudlow, notably Richard Clarida, who became the Fed\u2019s vice chairman in September and said in a November speech that he saw some signs of a stronger trend in productivity growth.\\r\\nOther Fed officials said last summer, when there were fewer risks to the economic outlook, that the central bank should keep raising rates into restrictive territory to slow what they saw as unsustainable growth.\\r\\nMr. Powell has sought to push the question into the future, suggesting he is open to either possibility.

The study found that the cyclists, both male and female, had thinner bones than the runners, even though all of the athletes were young, healthy and enviably fit, and many of the cyclists lifted weights.\\r\\nThe results underscore the divergent effects of various sports on our skeletons and also stir a little unease about the long-term impacts of pursuing low-impact exercise at the expense of more high-impact activities.\\r\\nBy and large, the available scientific evidence shows that physical activity is desirable and even necessary for bone health. Children who run, hop and play develop thicker, stronger bones than those who remain sedentary, as do teenagers and young adults who participate in sports involving sprinting and leaping.\\r\\nMost scientists agree that these kinds of activities build skeletal strength by generating sudden, sharp forces that minutely bow or deform the affected bones. Such activities jump-start processes within the body that increase the number of bone cells and help to prepare those parts of the skeleton to withstand similar forces in the future.\\r\\nEven middle-aged and older people, who once were thought to face inevitable thinning of their bones with age, can maintain strong skeletons if they are sufficiently active, recent studies show.\\r\\nBut which types of exercise bend bones in a desirable way \u2014 and which are too gentle \u2014 remains uncertain. Some past studies suggest that running generates enough force to remodel bone, while other experiments with runners conclude the opposite. Ditto with weight training. And multiple studies have raised concerns about negligible or even adverse effects from non \u2014 weight-bearing exercises, such as cycling and swimming, which put little pressure on bones.\\r\\nIn hopes of gaining more clarity about sports and bones, researchers at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences and the Norwegian Olympic Training Center, in Oslo, decided to look closely at the skeletons of world-class, competitive cyclists and runners.\\r\\nThey focused on elite, full-time athletes in large part because the athletes\u2019 heavy training could be expected to amplify any impacts from and differences between the two sports.\\r\\nThey wound up recruiting 21 high-level runners and 19 road cyclists, men and women, most of them in their 20s and all of them lean, fit and with several years of intense competition behind them.\\r\\nThe athletes reported to a lab, where scientists measured their body composition, with particular focus on the density of their bones, both over all and in their lower spines and the tops of their femurs \u2014 portions of the skeleton that can indicate general bone health.\\r\\nThe researchers also asked the athletes about their training, health and calcium intake and whether they spent much time in the gym. The latter question was of particular interest to the researchers, since weight training often is recommended to athletes in sports like cycling to bulk up their bones, as well as their muscles.\\r\\nThe scientists then compared data. Some of the differences between athletes were substantial, if expected. The cyclists trained far more than the runners, for instance, averaging about 900 hours a year in the saddle, versus about 500 annual hours on the road or treadmills for the runners.\\r\\nThe cyclists also did more weight training, with most of them heading to the gym during their off-season for intense lifting. None of the runners did that.\\r\\nThe athletes in both sports consumed enough calcium to meet their expected daily requirements.\\r\\nBut they had noticeably different bones.\\r\\nThe cyclists, as a group, all had thinner bones than the runners, and more than half of them met medical criteria for low bone mineral density in some portion of their skeleton. One of the riders, a man, displayed clinical osteoporosis in his spine.\\r\\nThese results are potentially worrisome, says Oddbjorn Klomsten Andersen, a graduate student at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences and a former national-team cyclist himself, who led the study, which was published in BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine.\\r\\n\u201cThere are limited studies following young cyclists through their careers,\u201d he says. \u201cBut studies in master cyclists demonstrate that a larger proportion of them have low bone mineral density or osteoporosis\u201d than people who do not cycle.\\r\\nThis study cannot tell us, though, why cyclists\u2019 bones might be thin, he adds. They could have been eating too little or sweating too much for ideal bone health. Both low calorie intake and high rates of calcium loss through sweating have been tied to bone loss in other studies.\\r\\nMore surprising, the cyclists\u2019 heavy weight training seems not to have built much bone.\\r\\nBut, as Mr. Andersen points out, this was a one-time snapshot of the athletes\u2019 health. It\u2019s possible, he says, that weight training prevented even greater bone thinning.\\r\\nIt is also encouraging, he says, that the runners harbored relatively healthy bones, since some past studies have hinted that running might not stimulate bone building.\\r\\nOver all, the study\u2019s findings suggest that serious cyclists might want to consider at least sometimes branching out, Mr. Andersen says.\\r\\n\u201cI would generally recommend combining cycling with weight-bearing exercise to promote good bone health,\u201d he says.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1792994965,\"description\":\"Research has raised concerns that activities like cycling and swimming may put too little pressure on bones.\\r\",\"title\":\"Phys Ed: Can Low-Impact Sports Like Cycling Be Putting Your Bones at Risk?\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"health.19.txt\"}],\"labelMap\":[[-1470032073,\"business\"],[1620813714,\"business\"],[391006090,\"world\"],[1668447843,\"business\"],[-1492412555,\"world\"],[-1004715158,\"business\"],[-727259249,\"technology\"],[1884837133,\"science\"],[-1501740769,\"technology\"],[-634690071,\"health\"],[1125083330,\"science\"],[1229292121,\"world\"],[411863084,\"world\"],[-1361980079,\"world\"],[489669537,\"world\"],[-1709632295,\"business\"],[326879815,\"science\"],[650611067,\"technology\"],[494067761,\"health\"],[1957449218,\"technology\"],[-582939649,\"technology\"],[-1116953762,\"health\"],[-1521949661,\"world\"],[-1309279343,\"world\"],[-1781385766,\"technology\"],[-1919147376,\"technology\"],[288498403,\"world\"],[254470884,\"technology\"],[1823608100,\"technology\"],[-583240374,\"technology\"],[2025704318,\"science\"],[-96237933,\"world\"],[409830808,\"technology\"],[829092437,\"technology\"],[-957075741,\"world\"],[-1986019822,\"technology\"],[-990418623,\"science\"],[2064830945,\"technology\"],[-1418713501,\"world\"],[-1904714508,\"technology\"],[-2030941738,\"business\"],[-1059350140,\"world\"],[-976253369,\"world\"],[1254265346,\"technology\"],[1792994965,\"health\"],[65063940,\"world\"],[-2122718852,\"technology\"],[-1045290466,\"technology\"],[1189967463,\"business\"],[-1070819612,\"health\"],[-1529928416,\"business\"],[2059735833,\"technology\"],[-373522571,\"technology\"],[-2146313290,\"science\"],[511430857,\"technology\"],[1502437256,\"technology\"],[-825453762,\"business\"],[1425051396,\"world\"],[-1250615417,\"health\"],[-324448097,\"world\"],[-164165755,\"technology\"],[1989778916,\"technology\"],[1028732566,\"world\"],[-1284555762,\"technology\"],[-811301431,\"business\"],[-403065203,\"technology\"],[1705918815,\"science\"],[-337178062,\"world\"],[450095445,\"technology\"],[-1473343492,\"world\"],[1441898756,\"technology\"],[-1858430965,\"technology\"],[927570284,\"business\"],[51690786,\"business\"],[-1300585391,\"business\"]],\"confusionMatrix\":[[2,0,0,8,4],[1,1,2,3,3],[1,0,0,3,1],[3,0,2,9,1],[4,1,1,1,7]],\"confusionLabels\":[\"business\",\"health\",\"science\",\"technology\",\"world\"],\"relabelingLabelMap\":[[-1781385766,\"technology\"],[-1309279343,\"world\"],[-1116953762,\"health\"],[-582939649,\"technology\"],[494067761,\"health\"],[650611067,\"technology\"],[326879815,\"science\"],[-1709632295,\"business\"],[489669537,\"world\"],[411863084,\"world\"],[1125083330,\"science\"],[-634690071,\"health\"],[-1501740769,\"technology\"],[-727259249,\"technology\"],[-1492412555,\"world\"],[1668447843,\"business\"],[1792994965,\"health\"],[-2122718852,\"health\"],[-164165755,\"health\"],[1028732566,\"health\"],[1705918815,\"health\"],[-1222156594,\"world\"]],\"accuracy\":0.38666666666666666,\"correctRelabeled\":[-582939649,494067761,326879815,-1501740769,1792994965],\"labelingPrecision\":0.29411764705882354,\"labelingRecall\":0.10869565217391304,\"correctAssignedItems\":[-1116953762,-582939649,494067761,326879815,-1709632295,1125083330,-1501740769,-1492412555,1668447843,1792994965],\"assignmentPrecision\":0.29411764705882354,\"openedItems\":[],\"numOpenedItems\":0,\"selectedItems\":[],\"selectedInCategory\":0,\"selectionRecall\":null},{\"modelOperation\":\"add\",\"changedFiles\":[{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"H.

The lousy performance of the Italian economy, reported on Thursday, is likely to aggravate relations between the European Commission and Italy\u2019s populist government, which has pursued spending policies widely regarded as irresponsible. Leaders on the Continent are already dealing with Britain\u2019s messy exit from the European Union.\\r\\nAt the same time, China\u2019s economy is slowing, in part because of President Trump\u2019s trade war. The data published Thursday by official statistics agencies provided a glimpse of just how intertwined China and Europe have become, and how vulnerable that leaves the eurozone. This weakness, in turn, adds to risks facing the United States, which is Europe\u2019s top trading partner.\\r\\nIn Italy, the government\u2019s debt load is one of the highest in the world. A prolonged economic slump would significantly add to the risk of default, with global repercussions.\\r\\nThe European Central Bank has in the past come to the rescue of Europe, and Italy in particular, but it has less scope to do so now. The bank is scaling back its purchases of government bonds, a stimulus measure that helped ensure there were buyers for Italian government debt.\\r\\n\u201cWe have weaker economic momentum and at the same time the E.C.B. is getting out of the market,\u201d said Katharina Uterm\u00f6hl, an economist at German insurer Allianz. \u201cThat means there is less room for policy mistakes.\u201d\\r\\nGiuseppe Conte, the Italian prime minister, hardly reassured his European partners when he said Thursday that the economic setback had nothing to do with his government.\\r\\n\u201cI am not worried in the least,\u201d Mr. Conte told reporters, calling the recession \u201ctemporary\u201d and blaming a tariff war between the United States and China that had hurt Italy\u2019s No. 1 trading partner, Germany, and \u201cwill find us all losers.\u201d\\r\\nThe Italian economy shrank 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with the third quarter, Istat, the Italian statistics agency, said. It was the second quarter in a row of declining output and that, by one common definition, means a recession. It is Italy\u2019s third since 2008.\\r\\nGrowth in the eurozone itself was just 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter, the European Union statistics agency said. That rate matched the previous quarter\u2019s, and anemic as it is, it might have been worse but for Spain and France. Spain\u2019s economy grew at an unexpectedly strong clip, rising 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the third. And in France, where the government has been struggling with mass public protests over economic duress, growth hit 0.3 percent.\\r\\nEconomists agree with Mr. Conte on one point \u2014 that China\u2019s woes are weighing on Europe.\\r\\nDuring the last decade, Europe profited from China\u2019s push to modernize its infrastructure. China equals the United States as a customer for heavy-duty German machinery, like cranes, textile machines or equipment for steel mills, and companies like Volkswagen have made the country a priority.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s our biggest market,\u201d said Ralph Wiechers, chief economist at the Mechanical Engineering Industry Association, which represents German machine manufacturers. \u201cWe still have growth, but we are noticing a lack of momentum.\u201d\\r\\nCritics of the Italian government blame its economic policies at home for its performance. Economists say the populist alliance has sowed uncertainty, prompting many Italians to spend less. A decline in consumer spending was a major culprit in the economy\u2019s setback.\\r\\nCarlo Cottarelli, a former director of the International Monetary Fund who led a spending review of the previous Italian government, reviewed the statistics on Thursday and said the alliance, in power since June, was responsible for Italy\u2019s slide. \u201cThis recession here, it can\u2019t be the fault of the previous government,\u201d he told a radio station in Padua.\\r\\nAfter a protracted fight last year with Brussels, Italy\u2019s government increased spending for broader welfare programs and generous pensions.

When she didn\u2019t hear from Apple Support, she exhausted every other avenue she could, including emailing and faxing Apple\u2019s security team, and posting to Twitter and Facebook. On Friday, Apple\u2019s product security team encouraged Ms. Thompson, a lawyer, to set up a developer account to send a formal bug report.\\r\\nBut it wasn\u2019t until Monday, more than a week after Ms. Thompson first notified Apple of the problem, that Apple raced to disable Group FaceTime and said it was working on a fix. The company reacted after a separate developer reported the FaceTime flaw and it was written about on 9to5mac.com, a news site for Apple fans, in an article that went viral.\\r\\nThe bug, and Apple\u2019s slow response to patching it, have renewed concerns about the company\u2019s commitment to security, even though it regularly advertises its bug reward program and boasts about the safety of its products. Hours before Apple\u2019s statement addressing the bug Monday, Tim Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive, tweeted that \u201cwe all must insist on action and reform for vital privacy protections.\u201d\\r\\nThe FaceTime problem has already been branded \u201cFacePalm\u201d by security researchers, who say Apple\u2019s security team should have known better. Rarely is there a software flaw that grants such high-level remote access and is so easy to manipulate: By adding a second person to a group FaceTime call, you can capture the audio and video of the first person called before that person answers the phone, or even if the person never answers.\\r\\n\u201cIf these kinds of bugs are slipping through,\u201d said Patrick Wardle, the co-founder of Digita Security, which focuses on Apple-related security, \u201cyou have to wonder if there are other problematic bugs that other hackers are exploiting that should have been caught.\u201d\\r\\n[Read how to disable FaceTime to avoid the eavesdropping bug.]\\r\\nOn Monday, Apple said it was aware of the issue and had \u201cidentified a fix that will be released in a software update later this week.\u201d\\r\\nBut the company has not addressed how the flaw passed through quality assurance, why it was so slow to respond to Ms. Thompson\u2019s urgent warnings, or whether it intends to reward the teenager whose mother raced to alert the company to the bug in the first place.\\r\\nA bug this easy to exploit is every company\u2019s worst security nightmare and every spy agency, cybercriminal and stalker\u2019s dream. In emails to Apple\u2019s product security team, Ms. Thompson noted that she and her son were just everyday citizens who believed they had uncovered a flaw that could undermine national security.\\r\\n\u201cMy fear is that this flaw could be used for nefarious purposes,\u201d she wrote in a letter provided to The New York Times. \u201cAlthough this certainly raises privacy and security issues for private individuals, there is the potential that this could impact national security if, for example, government members were to fall victim to this eavesdropping flaw.\u201d\\r\\nUnknown to Ms. Thompson, there is a healthy market for bugs and the code to weaponize them, which allow governments, defense contractors and cybercriminals to invisibly spy on people\u2019s devices without their knowledge, capturing everything from their locations to information caught on their microphones and cameras. The FaceTime flaw, and other Apple bugs, can fetch tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars, from dozens of brokers. Those brokers then sell those bugs for ever higher sums to governments and intelligence and law enforcement agencies around the world. On the seedier side of the spectrum are brokers who will sell these tools on the dark web to the highest bidder.\\r\\nThe only catch is that hackers must promise never to disclose the flaw to the vendor for patching, so that buyers can keep their access.\\r\\nThe market for Apple flaws has soared in the post-Edward Snowden era as technology makers include more security, like end-to-end encryption, to thwart would-be spies. This month, Zerodium, a well-known broker and security firm, raised its reward for an Apple iOS bug to $2 million.\\r\\nIn part to compete in that market, and reward those who do right by the company by notifying it of potentially lucrative bugs, Apple announced its own bounty program in 2016 \u2014 the last of the Silicon Valley companies to do so.\\r\\nAt a hacker conference that year in Las Vegas, Apple made a surprise announcement: It said it would start paying rewards as high as $200,000 to hackers who responsibly turned over crucial flaws in its products. But the bounty program has been slow going, in part, hackers say, because they can make multiples of that bounty on the black market, and because Apple has taken its time rewarding them for reporting problems.\\r\\nThe FacePalm bug is a particularly egregious case, researchers say, not just because it was discovered by a teenager simply trying to use his phone, but because it allowed full microphone and video access.\\r\\n\u201cThis is a bug that Apple\u2019s Q.A., should have caught,\u201d Mr. Wardle said. \u201cAnd where there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s almost always fire.\u201d\\r\\nBug brokers say FacePalm, while impressive, would not have brought a top price because it leaves a record of the attack. The flaw works only if you FaceTime the person you want to capture audio and video for, notifying your target of the call.\\r\\nBugs that fetch $2 million or $3 million on the black market leave no trace, work more than 99.5 percent of the time and work instantaneously, said Adriel Desautels, the chief executive of Netragard, a company that helps firms protect their software.\\r\\nIn this case, Mr. Desautels said, FacePalm is not as dangerous as a flaw that can covertly track someone\u2019s location, turn on that person\u2019s camera and capture video without a trace.\\r\\nBut, he added, \u201cit\u2019s pretty good for a high schooler.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-941067625,\"description\":\"A teenager in Arizona discovered the flaw, which allows eavesdropping, on Jan. 19, and his mother contacted Apple the next day.

While it has had some success with new products like the Apple Watch, the company has not found another product with the global impact of the iPhone, which was introduced more than a decade ago. Apple is also uniquely vulnerable to slowing consumer demand in China, as well as potential tariffs on Chinese-made products.\\r\\nApple\u2019s stock price is down a third since its peak last summer, and now it is worth less than several of its longtime rivals in the tech industry.\\r\\nApple could face more financial pressure if the Trump administration places tariffs on phones made in China \u2014 something President Trump has threatened to do. The bulk of Apple\u2019s products are made in Chinese factories.\\r\\nThere are also new concerns about a security flaw in the iPhone. On Monday, Apple customers said an iPhone user could call someone else who had an iPhone and listen in on that person\u2019s conversations through the device\u2019s microphone \u2014 even if the recipient did not answer the call. The problem was the result of a bug involving Apple\u2019s FaceTime app. The company promised to have a fix by the end of the week.\\r\\nApple\u2019s total revenue for the quarter was $84.3 billion, a 5 percent drop from a year earlier and in line with the revised forecast earlier this month.\\r\\nSales of iPhones, following a global trend for smartphones, have been leveling off for several years. Their revenue was $51.98 billion, a 15 percent drop from a year earlier. It\u2019s harder now to offer more specifics on iPhone sales because Apple recently stopped disclosing how many units it sells each quarter.\\r\\nLuca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an interview that sales had slumped largely because current iPhone owners were waiting longer to upgrade their devices, a trend that has continued into the current quarter. He blamed fewer subsidies from wireless carriers, a strengthening United States dollar and cheaper battery upgrades that consumers have used to extend the lives of their old phones.\\r\\nApple has attributed some of its issues in China to a trade war with the United States. And there is concern that some Chinese customers are shying away from Apple products out of national pride, particularly since the authorities in the United States brought charges against the Chinese telecom giant Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou. Prosecutors cited a decade-long attempt to steal trade secrets, obstruct a criminal investigation and evade economic sanctions on Iran.\\r\\n\u201cWe did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in greater China,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said this month.\\r\\nBut some data suggest Apple faces more fundamental problems with its business in China. Chinese consumers appear to be opting for less expensive but similar smartphones from Chinese makers, particularly Huawei. Some of Apple\u2019s latest phones top $1,000, far above the typical cost for its Chinese competitors.\\r\\nTotal sales in the region that includes China were down 25 percent in the fourth quarter to $13.17 billion. Outside China, revenues increased slightly.\\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019ve actually seen the economic situation in China continue to deteriorate over the course of the quarter,\u201d Mr. Maestri said. \u201cFrom mid-November onwards, we\u2019ve seen a deceleration of economic activity in China.\u201d\\r\\nBut he added that Apple had recovered some business by cutting prices in China for the iPhone XR, the lowest-priced new iPhone, to offset the strengthening dollar. Apple declined to disclose the exact size of the price cut.\\r\\nMr. Cook said in a call with financial analysts that he believed the iPhone\u2019s high price had hurt sales in emerging markets, and that Apple had dropped prices in a number of them.\\r\\nApple made up for tepid iPhone sales in the quarter with 19 percent revenue growth in other areas. The wearables category, which includes the Apple Watch and AirPods headphones, led the way with a 33 percent increase to $7.3 billion.\\r\\nApple\u2019s earnings per share were $4.18 in the quarter, beating analysts\u2019 expectations by a penny. Apple\u2019s overall profit was down 0.5 percent to $19.97 billion.\\r\\nApple\u2019s struggles appear to be continuing. The company said it expected between $55 billion and $59 billion in revenue in the current quarter, below analysts\u2019 expectations for $59 billion.\\r\\nApple\u2019s share price was up more than 5 percent in after-hours trading after its results were announced on Tuesday.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":389591184,\"description\":\"The iPhone maker, which reported quarterly earnings, faces a number of issues, from consumer demand in China to an unusual security bug in its iPhone software.\\r\",\"title\":\"Apple Says Profits Were Flat, Citing Slump in China\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"technology.29.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"WASHINGTON \u2014 He cannot get into the locked Venezuelan Embassy in Georgetown, has no staff and does not even live in a permanent residence in Washington.\\r\\nVenezuela\u2019s new ambassador to the United States, Carlos Vecchio, is spending his days doing what ambassadors all over the world do \u2014 meeting with leaders in his host country to win support for his government.\\r\\nYet it is a bit more complicated in the case of Venezuela, because Mr. Vecchio\u2019s leadership is not the only one claiming power in Caracas, the capital.\\r\\nThere are dueling governments, which means there is dueling diplomacy unfolding around the world.\\r\\nMost nations still recognize the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, a strongman leader who was re-elected last spring in a disputed vote and whose policies have led Venezuela to economic ruin. They continue to deal with Mr. Maduro\u2019s embassies and diplomats.\\r\\nBut at least 27 countries have recognized the government of Juan Guaid\u00f3, the 35-year-old leader of the National Assembly who last week proclaimed himself the interim president and called for new elections.\\r\\nAmong the leaders recognizing Mr. Guaid\u00f3 are President Trump, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and the heads of most Latin American nations. As a result, Mr. Guaid\u00f3 this week appointed ambassadors to at least 11 countries or organizations.\\r\\nAt the same time, Mr. Maduro has recalled at least some diplomats from those nations and shuttered embassies, barring the new appointees from getting in.\\r\\nIf things appear to be in disarray, that is because they are. There is no recent precedent for nations trying to sort out diplomacy with two rival governments that are based in the same capital.\\r\\nThere have been defections, of course. Mr. Vecchio said a dozen of 20 or so Venezuelans working in the embassy in Washington had decided to stay in the United States rather than obey the recall orders. The same has occurred with a handful of diplomats at Venezuela\u2019s consulate in Houston and with at least one, the veteran envoy Scarlett Salazar, in Miami. Mr. Vecchio said he planned to work with them as he built a diplomatic corps in Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s name.\\r\\n\u201cMany of them have been calling us saying: \u2018What is going to happen? We want to stay with you, we want to recognize President Guaid\u00f3 as the new president,\u2019\u201d Mr. Vecchio, 49, said in an interview in borrowed office space in downtown Washington.\\r\\nThe dueling diplomacy is critical in Venezuela\u2019s political rivalry, as the envoys are responsible for maintaining support for their respective presidents from their host country\u2019s leaders. Given Mr. Maduro\u2019s reliance on political support from Moscow, for example, his ambassador is most likely firming ties with President Vladimir V. Putin and the Kremlin. Russia and Cuba are Mr. Maduro\u2019s most important allies.\\r\\nMr. Vecchio is doing the same in Washington.\\r\\n\u201cOur interest is to just put in all the effort, all the pressure, to end the suppression of power, to end the dictatorship,\u201d Mr. Vecchio said of his meetings over the last week with American officials.\\r\\n\u201cOf course, we will discuss how we can protect our assets right here,\u201d he added.\\r\\nSo far, Mr. Guaid\u00f3 has dispatched ambassadors to the United States, Canada, the Lima Group and eight Latin American countries. On Tuesday, Mr. Vecchio flew to Washington from his home in Miami, where he has been a political activist working with the Venezuelan opposition in exile, for a White House meeting with Vice President Mike Pence.\\r\\nAlso present was Julio Borges, the ambassador to the Lima Group, an organization of Western Hemisphere countries that have been trying to resolve the long-running instability in Venezuela.\\r\\n\u201cWe were explaining to the vice president that this is a huge opportunity,\u201d Mr. Vecchio said. \u201cWe need to take advantage of this. This is the moment to move forward with increasing the pressure.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Vecchio told Mr. Pence and other American officials of the need to block Mr. Maduro\u2019s government from obtaining Venezuela\u2019s foreign assets and to instead turn them over to Mr. Guaid\u00f3. In the United States, that includes potentially billions from oil revenues sitting in bank accounts \u2014 the United States has imposed oil sanctions on Venezuela \u2014 and the embassy itself.\\r\\nA five-story red brick building just blocks from the Potomac River in Georgetown, the Venezuelan Embassy remained dark this week. A sign on the locked front door said there would be no visa service \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Vecchio said he had not gone by since arriving in Washington because he wanted to follow proper procedures for legally taking control of it.\\r\\nElliott Abrams, the new State Department special representative for Venezuela, said at a news conference on Wednesday that he had not yet looked into how to turn over control of the embassy. But, Mr. Abrams said, \u201cany financial asset of the government of Venezuela should be under the control of interim President Guaid\u00f3.\u201d\\r\\nHe added that the interim government and the United States were scouring the globe to find and secure Venezuelan government assets. \u201cObviously, if they have an account in Moscow, we\u2019re not going to get at it,\u201d he said.\\r\\nMr. Maduro has demanded that the United States shut down its embassy in Caracas. The State Department has refused because Mr. Guaid\u00f3 has asked the diplomats to stay. Mr. Abrams said the United States would have to find a way to maintain contact with Mr. Maduro and his allies in the absence of formal ties.\\r\\nMr. Vecchio is a polished politician who, on the surface, fits the role of ambassador well. He speaks fluent English and did postgraduate studies at Georgetown University and Harvard, where he was a Fulbright scholar. He helped Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, his friend and an opposition leader, found Voluntad Popular, the same political party of which Mr. Guaid\u00f3 is a member.\\r\\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Vecchio beseeched members of Congress to, among other things, grant more humanitarian aid to Venezuela. (The United States has already pledged $20 million in food and medical aid since Mr. Guaid\u00f3 claimed control.) That morning, Mr. Maduro posted a video warning Americans that intervention \u201cwould lead to a Vietnam worse than they can imagine.\u201d\\r\\nFernando Cutz, a former senior White House official on Latin America policy in the Trump and Obama administrations, said Mr. Vecchio was \u201cthe right choice\u201d to represent Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s government in Washington.\\r\\n\u201cHe\u2019s well connected and charismatic,\u201d Mr. Cutz said. \u201cHe knows the town.\u201d\\r\\nOn Friday, Mr. Vecchio flew home to Miami with Mr. Pence and several politicians from Florida, including Senator Marco Rubio, to meet with Venezuelan exiles.\\r\\nMultinational institutions have taken different approaches on which government in Caracas to recognize.\\r\\nThe Organization of American States recognizes Mr. Guaid\u00f3. The United Nations continues to recognize Mr. Maduro. Jared Genser, a human rights lawyer, wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed article published this week that the United Nations should evict all of Mr. Maduro\u2019s diplomats from the world body\u2019s mission in New York in what is known as a \u201ccredentials challenge.\u201d\\r\\nChanges of government in the Western Hemisphere have previously led to confusion within embassies. In 2009, when the military and the Supreme Court in Honduras ousted President Manuel Zelaya in a coup, he tried to keep his diplomats in foreign embassies even as his successor, Roberto Micheletti, was consolidating power.\\r\\nMr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s installation of new diplomats across much of Latin America has had a fitful start.\\r\\nHumberto Calder\u00f3n Berti, a former Venezuelan oil minister who served briefly as the nation\u2019s top diplomat in the 1990s, said he was in Madrid when the call came that he had been tapped to represent Mr. Guaid\u00f3 in Colombia, where a staggering one million economic refugees from Venezuela live.\\r\\n\u201cThis came out and I didn\u2019t know anything,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a complete surprise.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Calder\u00f3n said he has since spoken at least five times with Carlos Holmes Trujillo, Colombia\u2019s foreign minister. He is making arrangements to get accreditation from President Iv\u00e1n Duque of Colombia after Mr. Calder\u00f3n arrives early next week in Bogot\u00e1.\\r\\nHis first task, Mr. Calder\u00f3n said, will be to take control of the embassy building and remove employees who are loyal to Mr. Maduro and have not cleared out.\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019m telling the career diplomats they\u2019re welcome to stay. But there are political operatives and spies there, and they\u2019re going to have to go,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how long this is going to take.\u201d\\r\\nThe question of who runs the Venezuelan Embassy in Ecuador is causing anxiety in its capital, Quito, where the government once backed Mr. Maduro but is now recognizing Mr. Guaid\u00f3.\\r\\nEcuador plans to recognize Ren\u00e9 de Sola Quintero, a lawyer who was appointed as Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s ambassador to Quito. But it is unclear whether the host government has the right to remove Mr. Maduro\u2019s appointees from the embassy, an Ecuadorean official said.\\r\\nCarlos Scull, a 32-year-old Venezuelan political scientist with a banking background, has been named Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s envoy to Peru.

It\u2019s usually off-limits to patients, but maybe he knew I was a local doctor and faculty member at Harvard Medical School, which can occasionally get me a backstage pass. With a smirk, he told me I should eat something, pointing at the air in my stomach on the X-rays he had taken moments earlier.\\r\\nI\u2019d had surgery to remove three metastatic tumors from my lungs just hours before, and every breath ended with a wince. Food was not on my mind, but the tech had made me smile \u2014 air in the stomach usually signals that the patient needs to burp, not hunger. I began thinking about the potential for a case report in The New England Journal \u2014 34-year-old man with metastatic renal cell carcinoma needs a burp.\\r\\nBack in my hospital room, my mind went to the last time I found myself in a radiology reading room. It was Jan. 19, 2018, and I was looking at my own CT scan images late on a Friday afternoon, self-diagnosing the emotionally incomprehensible image before me as kidney cancer just minutes before my primary care doctor called back with the results. I called my brother and kept him on the phone with me for as long as I could, and still it was the most alone I have ever felt. My doctor told me that the radiologist said it was Stage 3, which meant that it could potentially be cured with surgical removal of my kidney. There were tiny nodules in my lungs, but they were too small to say anything definitive about.\\r\\nWithin a week, an all-star cast of renowned experts in renal uro-oncology had removed my left kidney. I was told that there was about a 50 percent chance this cancer would never return, and I wanted to believe that. I knew the numbers: five-year survival rates of Stage 4 or recurrent kidney cancer, in the lungs for example, are under 10 percent, though improving every year with new treatments. If only I could stay at Stage 3, maybe I could put this all behind me and live the life I had always planned with my wife watching our little boy grow up.\\r\\nIn recovery from my initial surgery, I shared a room with a man whose face I never saw but who seemed much sicker than I was. From the noises coming from behind the curtain, he seemed to be in a lot of discomfort, wandering in and out of consciousness. I was recovering from a freak illness, I told myself, but this man was very ill \u2014 a different kind of patient altogether. He couldn\u2019t tell that the blaring television was keeping me awake because most of the time he didn\u2019t seem to know what was going on around him. Eventually I was discharged and got some rest at home, but I still sometimes wonder how he had fared. \\r\\nIn the year since that initial operation and recovery, I\u2019ve begun to realize how much denial there was in my first assessment of that man. Refusing to believe that I might share his path may have been protective in the short term, letting me live this last year with love and laughter, work and play as though I could keep it up until my 90th birthday. \\r\\nBut my denial didn\u2019t do anything to prevent the anguish I felt when my cancer sprouted a new nodule in my right lung 10 months later. It didn\u2019t reduce the pain I felt finding out that those tiny nodules in my lungs at the time of diagnosis were cancer all along. Cancer patients usually attempt to maintain a positive attitude, and I appreciate how much better it is to do so than to be consumed by negativity, but no mind-set would have meaningfully muted the shock of my recurrence and the burden of having to tell my family that actually I\u2019ve been in Stage 4 all along. We just didn\u2019t know it.\\r\\nThis last year, I\u2019ve lived more fully than ever before in my life, holding my wife and son tighter and saying \u201cno\u201d more readily to work projects and other demands on my time that wouldn\u2019t enrich my life. I\u2019ve learned to let life\u2019s frustrations roll off me more casually, though the hospital parking garage still manages to make my blood boil. I\u2019ve made sure to tell my family and friends that I love them.\\r\\nNo one can tell me with any certainty about what lies ahead. Will I be ready for it? These questions circle in my mind on an ever-present loop without resolution. I know that I can\u2019t predict what comes next, but since my cancer recurred I have become committed to living in each moment and listening for clues about tomorrow.\\r\\nIn my recovery from last week\u2019s lung surgery, I again shared a room with someone further along in his illness than I. While I have no access to the details of his case, the somber tones used by his doctors behind the curtain were telling. His treatments were not working. His cancer was advancing, and a new plan had to be formed urgently. \\r\\nAs with my last hospital roommate, I never saw this man\u2019s face and we never spoke, but I feel immeasurably close to him, as though in some ways I know him better than my dearest friends. He heard me gasping for air through the night and yelping in pain as the chest tube got pulled, and I heard him trying to be brave for his family, reassuring them that they would go forward with whatever came next as best they could. I heard him speak in a reassuring voice to his children, only to hang up and weep loudly into the night until passing into a sleep from pure exhaustion.\\r\\nListening to him was like a kind of sonar, an echo bouncing back to me from my own future path, hinting at what\u2019s to come.\\r\\nWhen I was getting ready for discharge, I had the urge to pull the curtain and embrace him as he told me the secrets of what to expect next. I would ask how had he navigated the path from here to there. I would lay down the weight of uncertainty that surrounds my life and ask: What should I do now? How I can live with only a vague sense of dread of what\u2019s to come as my guide?\\r\\nBut he could not have given me answers, just as no one could have articulated what lay ahead for me at other junctures, such as when I started medical school, became a husband and a father or at the time of my diagnosis. The next steps must be discovered in the journey itself.\\r\\nAdam Philip Stern is the director of psychiatric applications at the Berenson-Allen Center for Noninvasive Brain Stimulation and an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-2122718852,\"description\":\"Listening to the experience of my roommate in the cancer ward was like a kind of sonar, an echo bouncing back to me from my own future path, hinting at what\u2019s to come.\\r\",\"title\":\"Doctors: Lessons From Behind the Curtain\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"health.21.txt\"}],\"labelMap\":[[-1470032073,\"business\"],[1620813714,\"business\"],[391006090,\"world\"],[1668447843,\"business\"],[-1492412555,\"world\"],[-1004715158,\"business\"],[-727259249,\"technology\"],[1884837133,\"science\"],[-1501740769,\"technology\"],[-634690071,\"health\"],[1125083330,\"science\"],[1229292121,\"world\"],[411863084,\"world\"],[-1361980079,\"world\"],[489669537,\"world\"],[-1709632295,\"business\"],[326879815,\"science\"],[650611067,\"technology\"],[494067761,\"health\"],[1957449218,\"technology\"],[-582939649,\"technology\"],[-1116953762,\"health\"],[-1521949661,\"world\"],[-1309279343,\"world\"],[-1781385766,\"technology\"],[-1919147376,\"technology\"],[288498403,\"world\"],[254470884,\"technology\"],[1823608100,\"technology\"],[-583240374,\"technology\"],[2025704318,\"science\"],[-96237933,\"world\"],[409830808,\"technology\"],[829092437,\"technology\"],[-957075741,\"world\"],[-1986019822,\"technology\"],[-990418623,\"science\"],[2064830945,\"technology\"],[-1418713501,\"world\"],[-1904714508,\"technology\"],[-2030941738,\"business\"],[-1059350140,\"world\"],[-976253369,\"world\"],[1254265346,\"technology\"],[1792994965,\"health\"],[65063940,\"world\"],[-2122718852,\"health\"],[-1045290466,\"technology\"],[1189967463,\"business\"],[-1070819612,\"health\"],[-1529928416,\"business\"],[2059735833,\"technology\"],[-373522571,\"technology\"],[-2146313290,\"science\"],[511430857,\"technology\"],[1502437256,\"technology\"],[-825453762,\"business\"],[1425051396,\"world\"],[-1250615417,\"health\"],[-324448097,\"world\"],[-164165755,\"technology\"],[1989778916,\"technology\"],[1028732566,\"world\"],[-1284555762,\"technology\"],[-811301431,\"business\"],[-403065203,\"technology\"],[1705918815,\"science\"],[-337178062,\"world\"],[450095445,\"technology\"],[-1473343492,\"world\"],[1441898756,\"technology\"],[-1858430965,\"technology\"],[927570284,\"business\"],[51690786,\"business\"],[-1300585391,\"business\"],[-1639301803,\"business\"],[1512981334,\"business\"],[750586142,\"world\"],[-941067625,\"technology\"],[389591184,\"technology\"],[-1222156594,\"business\"]],\"confusionMatrix\":[[4,0,0,8,4],[1,1,2,2,3],[1,0,0,3,1],[3,0,2,11,1],[5,1,1,1,8]],\"confusionLabels\":[\"business\",\"health\",\"science\",\"technology\",\"world\"],\"relabelingLabelMap\":[[-1781385766,\"technology\"],[-1309279343,\"world\"],[-1116953762,\"health\"],[-582939649,\"technology\"],[494067761,\"health\"],[650611067,\"technology\"],[326879815,\"science\"],[-1709632295,\"business\"],[489669537,\"world\"],[411863084,\"world\"],[1125083330,\"science\"],[-634690071,\"health\"],[-1501740769,\"technology\"],[-727259249,\"technology\"],[-1492412555,\"world\"],[1668447843,\"business\"],[1792994965,\"health\"],[-2122718852,\"health\"],[-164165755,\"health\"],[1028732566,\"health\"],[1705918815,\"health\"],[-1222156594,\"world\"]],\"accuracy\":0.43209876543209874,\"correctRelabeled\":[-582939649,494067761,326879815,-1501740769,1792994965,-2122718852],\"labelingPrecision\":0.3333333333333333,\"labelingRecall\":0.13043478260869565,\"correctAssignedItems\":[-1116953762,-582939649,494067761,326879815,-1709632295,1125083330,-1501740769,-1492412555,1668447843,1792994965,-2122718852],\"assignmentPrecision\":0.3333333333333333,\"openedItems\":[],\"numOpenedItems\":0,\"selectedItems\":[],\"selectedInCategory\":0,\"selectionRecall\":null},{\"modelOperation\":\"update\",\"changedFiles\":[{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"I had hoped to avoid ushering in the new year with yet another weight\/diet column, but three circumstances prompted me to reconsider:\\r\\n1) The latest data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that the weight of American men and women has continued its upward climb, with the average B.M.I. now almost at the cutoff for obesity; \\r\\n2) The Food and Drug Administration is rolling out changes in serving sizes on packaged foods that could very well make matters worse, especially for consumers of ice cream and soda, and\\r\\n3) Some good news for a change: the publication of an eminently sensible approach to weight loss, \u201cFinally Full, Finally Slim,\u201d written by a leading expert on portion control, Lisa R. Young, a registered dietitian and adjunct professor of nutrition at New York University.\\r\\nUnlike the myriad diet fads that have yet to stem the ever-increasing girth of American men and women, what Dr. Young describes is not a diet but a practical approach to food and eating that can be adapted to almost any way of life, even if most meals are eaten out or taken out. It is not prescriptive or even proscriptive. It does not cut out any category of food, like carbohydrates or fats, nor does it deprive people of their favorite foods, including sweet treats.\\r\\nAnd it works. I know, because more than half a century ago I lost 40 pounds in two years following Dr. Young\u2019s approach, and I\u2019ve kept the weight off ever since without dieting or deprivation. It fills me up with delicious, nutritious foods and allows me to enjoy a frequent nightcap of ice cream \u2014 half a cup (measured) at 150 calories or less.\\r\\nDr. Young\u2019s emphasis is less on what you eat and more on how much you eat of any food, including those considered healthful. Which is one reason I worry about potential damage from the mandated changes in serving sizes now being phased in, which could encourage those aiming to stick with a single serving to overeat.\\r\\nFor better or worse, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 requires that serving sizes listed on Nutrition Facts labels reflect current eating habits \u2014 how much people actually eat as opposed to how much they should eat. And since Americans now consume considerably more of most foods than they did three decades ago, the serving sizes on food labels will increase accordingly.\\r\\nAs a result, a serving of ice cream, for example, which for many decades has been listed as one-half cup, has now grown to two-thirds of a cup. And a serving of soda, long 8 ounces, is now 12 ounces. And a packaged food usually consumed at one sitting, including a 20-ounce soda, is also considered one serving.\\r\\nThe good news is that the calories in that serving now appear in large bold type on the label, so that if people consider how many calories they would be consuming, they won\u2019t be hoodwinked. (Another virtue of the new labels is the separate listing of \u201cadded sugars,\u201d distinguishing these commercially introduced sweeteners from sugars that occur naturally in foods like milk and fruits.)\\r\\nBut back to portions. If you\u2019re serious about losing or maintaining weight, you\u2019d be wise to learn the size of a healthful portion of various categories of foods and treat what is typically served in restaurants to individual diners as servings for two or more. My \u201clean and mean\u201d son and daughter-in-law in Los Angeles routinely order one entree for two people, and often have leftovers to take home for lunch the next day. In fact, my daughter-in-law usually requests a to-go container when the meal is ordered and packs up the excess food even before they dig in.\\r\\nStill, Dr. Young insists \u2014 and I agree \u2014 that it\u2019s far more helpful to prepare and eat most of your meals at home. You\u2019ll know what\u2019s in them (was that grilled fish you ordered prepared with a tablespoon of butter?) and how much lands on your plate. In fact, start by downsizing your dinner dishes to salad-plate size, and you can save nearly 600 calories a meal. Use measuring cups to dole out reasonable portions until you are able to eyeball them accurately. You might also invest in a kitchen scale to help you keep meat, poultry and fish servings to three or four ounces.\\r\\nI know you\u2019ve heard this before, but it bears repeating: Fill half or more of your plate with low-carbohydrate vegetables, like broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, green beans, carrots and brussels sprouts, and have a side salad with a dribble of dressing. Limit starchy vegetables like white and sweet potatoes (baked, not fried) and grains (whole, not refined) to a half-cup serving, one-cup max.\\r\\nDr. Young urges people to \u201cget over their fear of carbs \u2014 if you\u2019re eating the right kinds of grains in the right amounts, they don\u2019t make you fat. They make you full \u2014 and provide you with a battalion of disease-fighting nutrients,\u201d she wrote. But watch out for those oversized New York bagels, whole grain or otherwise, that are the caloric equivalent of six slices of bread.\\r\\nMany people are unaware of how much, or how often, they eat. Keeping a food diary, recording everything you consume and where for a week or so, can help you recognize sources of mindless or excess consumption and their relationship to your feelings and circumstances.\\r\\nBe wary of \u201cnutrition halos\u201d \u2014 foods deemed healthful but loaded with calories, albeit from healthy fats. A friend who moved to California gained 25 pounds in a year eating avocados from the tree in her yard. A serving of avocado is \u00bc cup. Same for nuts, which, along with air-popped corn, are my favorite snacks.\\r\\nAt the same time, Dr. Young and I recognize the dangers inherent in feeling deprived of cherished, not-so-good-for you foods.

And on Monday, the Health Ministry said that medical records for 14,200 H.I.V.-positive people in the city-state had been obtained by an American whose Singaporean partner worked at the ministry. The ministry said it learned on Jan. 22 that the records had been illegally disclosed online.\\r\\nExperts say the breaches highlight the potential pitfalls for Singapore and other countries that are pushing to make vast troves of data more accessible and centralized. Do the public benefits justify the inherent risks to privacy? And can anyone prevent senior officials from misusing information they have at their fingertips?\\r\\nIn addition, the H.I.V. records breach illuminates the widespread stigma and discrimination that people with the virus face in Singapore, a conservative society where gay sex \u2014 which accounts for roughly half of new H.I.V. infections in the country \u2014 is banned under a colonial-era law.\\r\\n\u201cWhy are people so concerned about their status being known?\u201d said Eamonn Murphy, the Asia Pacific director at the United Nations agency UNAIDS. \u201cIt\u2019s the issue of stigma and discrimination, and it\u2019s familial, for some of them, but clearly workplace: fear of loss of employment.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cThat\u2019s a bigger issue that the ministry or the government of Singapore should be trying to address,\u201d Mr. Murphy said.\\r\\nThe authorities say the perpetrator in the cyberattack last year targeted the medical records of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, a cancer survivor. S. Iswaran, the minister of communication and information, told lawmakers this month that the attacker could not be identified because of national security concerns.\\r\\nMr. Iswaran also said that copied personal data had not \u201cemerged in any form\u201d on the so-called dark web, a part of the internet that relies on encryption and is often used for criminal activities.\\r\\nIn the second episode, the Health Ministry said it learned in 2016 that a foreigner might have been in possession of confidential information from the H.I.V. registry. The records included names, identification numbers, contact details, H.I.V. test results and related medical information for 5,400 Singaporeans whose infections were diagnosed as recently as January 2013, and 8,800 foreigners diagnosed up to December 2011.\\r\\nThe suspect, Mikhy K. Farrera Brochez, is an American who reportedly tested positive for H.I.V. in 2008 using a fake passport from the Bahamas, shortly after arriving in Singapore.\\r\\nForeigners with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, are not allowed to work in Singapore. To get around that, prosecutors said, Mr. Brochez\u2019s partner, Ler Teck Siang \u2014 a Singaporean doctor who works at the Health Ministry \u2014 twice submitted his own blood sample when the Singaporean authorities tested Mr. Brochez for H.I.V.\\r\\n\u201cThis incident is believed to have arisen from the mishandling of information by Ler, who is suspected of not having complied with the policies and guidelines on the handling of confidential information,\u201d the Health Ministry said in a statement on Monday.\\r\\nDesmond Wai, a gastroenterologist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Specialist Center in Singapore, said that the cyberattack last year illustrated how the country\u2019s electronic records are vulnerable to hacking, no matter how secure they may appear.\\r\\n\u201cThere is a Chinese saying: \u2018If the good is one feet tall, the evil will be three feet tall,\u2019\u201d he said. \\\"So I think there\u2019s always a risk.\u201d\\r\\nDr. Wai said that for the most part it was not fair to blame the Health Ministry for the second breach, because it would be hard to prevent a senior official from gaining access to the government\u2019s H.I.V. registry.\\r\\nBut he added that Dr. Ler, the former head of the ministry\u2019s National Public Health Unit, should not have had such wide access to national H.I.V. records in the first place, nor an ability to download them.\\r\\nTom Uren, a cyberpolicy analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in Canberra, said that the leak of Singapore\u2019s H.I.V. records highlighted a common challenge that many governments face: trying improve overall health services and efficiency while also protecting individuals\u2019 privacy.\\r\\nWhile Singapore\u2019s H.I.V. registry was clearly raided by a \u201cbad apple,\u201d he added, the leak points to potential problems with oversight of the record-keeping system \u2014 and with the storage of H.I.V. test results alongside so much personal information.\\r\\n\u201cThere\u2019s actually no need for all that data to be held together,\u201d Mr. Uren said.\\r\\nMr. Brochez was convicted in 2017 of numerous offenses, including lying to labor officials about his H.I.V. status, providing false information to the police and using forged degree certificates in job applications, the ministry said.\\r\\nHe was sentenced to 28 months in prison, and later deported. The ministry said he was currently outside Singapore, but it did not specify where.\\r\\nHis partner, Dr. Ler, was sentenced in November to 24 months in prison for abetting cheating and providing false information to the police and the Health Ministry. Dr. Ler, who is appealing that conviction, has also been charged with mishandling confidential information related to H.I.V.-positive patients.\\r\\nOn Monday, the Health Ministry apologized for \u201cthe anxiety and distress caused by this incident\u201d and said it had been contacting those affected by the breach. The ministry also said it would \u201ccontinue to regularly review our systems to ensure that they remain secure and that the necessary safeguards are in place.\u201d\\r\\nAs of late Tuesday evening, the ministry had not responded to questions from The New York Times about how the two data breaches occurred.\\r\\nAdvocacy groups say the disclosure of so many records has sent chills through H.I.V.-positive people in Singapore who were already battling a widespread stigma.\\r\\nAbout half of the roughly 450 new cases of H.I.V. infection reported in Singapore each year are transmitted through same-sex intercourse, according to the Health Ministry\u2019s data. But experts say that a major barrier to prevention is that few gay and bisexual men in Singapore are open about their sexual orientation.\\r\\n\u201cFear is what drives people underground and makes them come too late to health services,\u201d said Mr. Murphy of UNAIDS. \u201cOne, it doesn\u2019t help them for their own personal health outcome, and two, it doesn\u2019t help prevent further transmissions of disease. This is why it\u2019s so critical to have a protective environment.\u201d\\r\\nRoy Chan, an expert on H.I.V. at the National University of Singapore and the president of the advocacy group Action for AIDS Singapore, said in a statement that the group was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the data leak.\\r\\nHe said it was a criminal act that should be \u201ccondemned and answered in the most severe terms possible.\u201d\\r\\nPaerin Choa, a spokesman for Pink Dot SG, a group that advocates for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in Singapore, said victims of the leak now faced \u201cthe prospect of further stigmatization and discrimination, thanks to the fear and ignorance surrounding H.I.V. and people living with H.I.V.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Choa said that people had no legal protection from discrimination in the workplace based on their H.I.V. status, sexual orientation or gender identity, and that the practice of deporting immigrants who test positive for the virus was unnecessarily cruel.\\r\\nHe said the government should \u201ctake moral and political responsibility by acknowledging what H.I.V.-positive individuals have to endure in our country, and take concrete action to enact anti-discrimination legislation to support\u201d them.\\r\\n\u201cThis would reduce harm done to those whose names have been exposed,\u201d he said.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-90301954,\"description\":\"Experts say security concerns are a pitfall for countries that are pushing to make vast troves of data more accessible and centralized.\\r\",\"title\":\"Data Breaches Dent Singapore\u2019s Image as a Tech Innovator\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"technology.31.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"The Federal Reserve indicated on Wednesday that it was done raising interest rates for the foreseeable future, after a run of incremental increases that began to affect the typical consumer\u2019s wallet.\\r\\nThe decision will hold the central bank\u2019s benchmark for short-term rates to a target between 2.25 and 2.5 percent, the level it reached in December after steadily climbing since the end of 2015. \\r\\nThat is the target for the federal funds rate, the interest rate that banks and depository institutions charge one another for overnight loans. It influences how banks and other lenders price certain loans and savings vehicles.\\r\\nWhether you will cheer or chafe at the halt depends, broadly, on whether you\u2019re a saver or a spender.  For savers and retirees, who were only just starting to find accounts that paid more than 2 percent, the end of rate increases means that\u2019s as good as it will get. But people trying to whittle down a pile of credit card debt, thinking about tapping their home equity line of credit or buying a car should welcome the fact that the cost of those loans won\u2019t keep rising.\\r\\nHere\u2019s where interest rates on loans and savings accounts stand right now:\\r\\n\\r\\nDeposit Accounts and C.D.s \\r\\nWhen the Fed raises rates, some banks may pay more interest on savings accounts, particularly when they want to lure consumers to park their money. But the big banks haven\u2019t been too generous lately, and you shouldn\u2019t expect much to change any time soon. Today, the average savings and money market deposit accounts pay a paltry 0.23 percent, according to BankRate.com. That\u2019s up from 0.10 percent in 2015, when the Fed starting raising rates. \\r\\nYou also shouldn\u2019t rush to tie up your money in certificates of deposit, which tend to move in step with similarly dated Treasury securities. Two-year C.D.s are paying just more than 1 percent on average, but you can find some paying 3 percent if you take the time to comparison shop, according to BankRate.com.\\r\\nOnline Savings\\r\\nYou\u2019ll probably do better with an online savings account; many are already paying more than 2.25 percent and may rise further. \\r\\n\u201cFor the first time in more than a decade, you can earn more than the rate of inflation on your savings account, but only if you shop around,\u201d said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at BankRate.com. \\r\\nThe inflation rate, which measures how much prices have risen from a year ago, is now roughly 2 percent. If your money isn\u2019t earning at least that much, you\u2019re losing purchasing power.\\r\\nCitizens Access is offering 2.35 percent and CIBC Bank USA 2.39 percent, according to BankRate.com, while at least two other online banks are offering 2.4 percent. \\r\\nBonds\\r\\nBond investors often get nervous when interest rates rise, because bond prices tend to fall in response. Why? When rates increase, the price of existing (and lower-yielding) bonds drops because investors can buy new bonds that offer higher interest rates.\\r\\nNow that interest rates have stabilized, at least for now, bond fund investors might be less distracted by rate-related volatility \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean bonds won\u2019t continue to react to broader economic conditions and news. It\u2019s best to focus on why bonds are in your portfolio to begin with \u2014 to act as a buffer against stocks \u2014 and to avoid fretting about short-term moves.\\r\\n\\r\\nHome Loans\\r\\nMany people think mortgage rates are tied to the Fed\u2019s short-term rate, but there isn\u2019t a direct link. Most 30-year fixed-rate mortgages are priced off the 10-year Treasury bond, which is influenced by a variety of factors, including the outlook for inflation and long-term economic growth here and abroad.\\r\\nBut some home loans are more directly connected to the Fed\u2019s short-term rate, including home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, or A.R.M.s. \\r\\nA typical home-equity borrower has already seen rates rise to about 6.7 percent, according to BankRate.com, from roughly 4.5 percent three years ago. \\r\\nThe combination of the recent increases and changes in the tax code that restricted the interest deduction \u201cis a bit of a double pinch for some,\u201d said Keith Gumbinger of HSH.com, which tracks the mortgage market. \\r\\nThe good news related to adjustable-rate mortgages, which typically have a fixed rate for a number of years and then adjust annually, is that few people have them, Mr. Gumbinger said. But even though the Fed is done raising rates, borrowers who are already out of their fixed-rate period can expect to pay more when rates reset, if they haven\u2019t already. \\r\\nConsumer Loans\\r\\nVariable rates on credit cards are averaging around 17.7 percent, up from about 15.7 percent at the end of 2015, and the cumulative effect of past rate increases had begun to squeeze car buyers.\\r\\nSince the Fed started raising rates, the annual percentage rate on a car loan has increased more than a percentage point, to 6.2 percent in January from 4.6 percent three years earlier, according to Edmunds. And incentives like zero-percent financing have all but dried up, Edmunds\u2019s experts said.\\r\\nThose paying off federal student loans won\u2019t be affected, because those loans carry a fixed rate. The rate for the next round of new loans will be set in July, based on the 10-year Treasury bond. But fixed and variable rates for private student loans are generally based on the Libor index, which tends to track the Fed funds rate pretty closely. So students in that market can take some relief in the halt.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1469931254,\"description\":\"There are consequences whether you have a savings account or a credit card (or both).\\r\",\"title\":\"Here\u2019s What the Fed\u2019s Halt on Interest Rates Means for Your Wallet\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"business.32.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"A major bug in Apple\u2019s FaceTime app surfaced on Monday that allows anyone with an iPhone, iPad or Mac computer to eavesdrop on other users without their knowledge.

It exists on iOS devices with the most recent software updates, starting with iOS 12.1, which was released in October. That release introduced the Group FaceTime feature.\\r\\nTo check your iOS version, open the \u201cSettings\u201d app, scroll down and select \u201cGeneral,\u201d and then click on \u201cAbout.\u201d In the following list, you\u2019ll see a line titled \u201cVersion\u201d followed by the operating system on your device. It may say 12.1.3, the latest iOS update.\\r\\nIf your iOS is 12.1 or newer, such as 12.1.3, your device could be at risk. If it is 12.0 or older, you\u2019re in the clear.\\r\\nOn Macs, the Group FaceTime feature was introduced in October, starting with MacOS 10.14.1. Check your MacOS version by selecting the Apple icon in the top left of your screen and clicking on \u201cAbout This Mac.\u201d The latest version is MacOS 10.14.3.\\r\\n\\r\\nStep 2: Turn off FaceTime\\r\\nOn an iOS device, open \u201cSettings\u201d again. Scroll down a bit until you see \u201cFaceTime\u201d and select it. This part is simple: Tap the green button on the top row, which will toggle FaceTime off. The button should turn gray and everything that had been below, such as your app settings, should disappear.\\r\\nApple says there\u2019s no need to delete the app on your home screen after following this step, but nothing\u2019s stopping you.\\r\\nJust note that if you disable FaceTime, your phone will not receive any kind of FaceTime call, including video, audio or group chat. Regular phone calls won\u2019t be affected.\\r\\nTo turn off FaceTime on Macs, open the app, which may be in your dock or in your Applications folder, select \u201cFaceTime\u201d at the top left of the app, and then select \u201cPreferences.\u201d Click on \u201cSign Out.\u201d\\r\\nStep 3: Wait for bug fix\\r\\nApple said that a software update scheduled for release later this week should resolve the Group FaceTime bug. When it is announced, make sure to update your devices by going to \u201cSettings,\u201d then \u201cGeneral\u201d and selecting \u201cSoftware Update.\u201d On the Mac, download the update by clicking on the Apple icon on the top left of your screen, selecting \u201cSystem Preferences\u201d and clicking on \u201cSoftware Update.\u201d\\r\\nAfter that, re-enable the FaceTime app by following Step 2.

Mr. Quirin and Mr. Redouane, whose names were initially protected under French law because they belonged to an anti-gang unit, have repeatedly denied the accusations, and are appealing their convictions.\\r\\nThe government\u2019s statistics report said that the increase in reported sexual crimes was part of an upward trend that started several years ago, noting for example that the share of victims of sexual violence outside of the household who had decided to file a complaint had nearly tripled from 2016 to 2017.\\r\\n\u201cThe increase in the number of crimes reported to the security forces these past years can be tied at least in part to an improvement in the rate of complaints filed,\u201d the report said, noting that the willingness of victims to come forward had been \u201camplified\u201d by the accusations of abuse against the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and by the associated #MeToo movement.\\r\\nThe increase could also be tied to official awareness campaigns encouraging victims to come forward, and to the government\u2019s efforts to improve the police\u2019s handling of sexual violence cases, the report said.\\r\\nOne of the government\u2019s more recent measures was an online portal for reporting sexual or sexism crimes, opened in November, through which a specially trained officer assists victims in filing official complaints.\\r\\nThe government has also introduced new legislation against sexist catcalling, leading to a first conviction in September.\\r\\nBut the report published this week cautioned that the number of cases reported to the police was still far below the number of actual victims. It pointed to surveys showing that on average, from 2011 to 2017, only one out of eight victims of sexual violence filed a complaint with the authorities.\\r\\nOf the roughly 19,000 people in France who reported a rape to the police in 2018, nearly 90 percent were women, and in about 30 percent of cases the perpetrator was a close family member, the report said. Women were also overwhelmingly the targets of sexual assault, representing over 80 percent of the roughly 28,000 victims who went to the police in France in 2018, the report said.\\r\\nIn Ms. Spanton\u2019s case, after encountering a group of police officers at a bar in April 2014, the officers invited her for a night tour of 36 Quai des Orf\u00e8vres, a police building frequently depicted in movies and television shows. Ms. Spanton said that she was then forced to drink more alcohol and that she was gang raped several times.\\r\\nMs. Spanton filed a complaint immediately, but after an investigation that put her through multiple psychological reviews, in 2016, a panel of investigative judges ruled that there was not enough evidence to proceed to trial. That decision was overturned on appeal the following year.\\r\\nAt trial, the defense questioned Ms. Spanton\u2019s credibility by cross-examining her about her clothes, her alcohol consumption and her past use of drugs. The prosecution argued that DNA testing and phone records supported her account and dismissed the claim that Ms. Spanton had been flirting with the police officers at the bar as irrelevant. \u201cOne can kiss at 10 p.m. and refuse to have sexual relations at 1 a.m.,\u201d the prosecutor, Philippe Courroye, said in his closing arguments.\\r\\nMs. Spanton\u2019s lawyer, Sophie Obadia, hailed the officers\u2019 convictions as proof that France, where some have regarded the #MeToo movement with skepticism, was moving past an outdated view of sexual violence.\\r\\n\u201cAt last, in France, it is considered that a woman who was raped does not have to explain herself about her private life,\u201d Ms. Obadia told reporters at the central Paris courthouse after the two officers were found guilty. \u201cThe court found that Ms. Spanton had not lied, was not a mythomaniac, and it based its ruling on the objective evidence of the case, which is not her word against the word of the accused.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":2130086515,\"description\":\"A government analysis found victims increasingly willing to talk to the authorities.

But he was still employed and covered by his company\u2019s group insurance.\\r\\nWhen his birthday came around, he began researching whether he needed to move to Medicare, and determined he could stick with his employer\u2019s plan, said Mr. Farrell, a marketing and merchandising executive for specialty retailers. At the time, he was working for a company that makes infomercials in San Francisco.\\r\\nFour months later, Mr. Farrell was laid off, but he kept the company\u2019s health insurance for himself and his family under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (Cobra), the federal law that allows employees to pay for coverage as long as 36 months after a worker leaves a job.\\r\\n\u201cI just thought, this is great \u2014 the coverage won\u2019t change,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI was just relying on my own logic and experience, and felt that if I didn\u2019t need a government service, I wouldn\u2019t sign up for it.\u201d\\r\\nBut Mr. Farrell unknowingly ran afoul of one of the complex rules that govern the transition to Medicare \u2014 and now he is paying the price.\\r\\nMedicare requires enrollees to sign up during a limited window before and after their 65th birthday. Failing to do so leads to stiff late-enrollment penalties that continue for life, and potentially expensive, long waits for coverage to begin. There is one major exception: People who are still employed when they turn 65 can stay with employer-provided group coverage.\\r\\nWhat Mr. Farrell missed is that Cobra coverage did not qualify him for that exemption, since he was no longer actively employed. He didn\u2019t realize his error for more than a year, when the end of his Cobra coverage approached and he began looking into Medicare. The mistake means that he will pay a late-enrollment penalty equal to 20 percent of the Part B base premium for the rest of his life. This year, the penalty increases his monthly standard premium of $135.50 to $162.60.\\r\\nThe transition to Medicare from other types of insurance is plagued by problems like Mr. Farrell\u2019s \u2014 and, so far, there isn\u2019t much of an early warning system to alert people close to retirement age of the pitfalls. These complex rules also affect people moving from Affordable Care Act exchange plans and retiree health coverage. And workers who use Health Savings Accounts in conjunction with high-deductible employer insurance need to watch out for tax issues related to timing.\\r\\nThe basics on signing up\\r\\nMedicare enrollment in Part A (hospitalization) and Part B (outpatient services) is automatic if you have claimed Social Security benefits before your 65th birthday \u2014 your Medicare card will arrive in the mail and coverage begins the first day of the month in which you turn 65. There is no premium charged for Part A in most cases, and you may be able to turn down Part B at that point without incurring late-enrollment penalties if you are still working and receive your primary insurance through work.\\r\\nIf you have not yet applied for Social Security, signing up for Medicare requires proactive steps to avoid problems.\\r\\nMedicare offers an Initial Enrollment Period around your 65th birthday. If you miss that window, you will be subject to a late enrollment surcharge equal to 10 percent of the standard Part B premium for each 12 months of delay \u2014 a penalty that continues forever. That can really add up. In 2017, 1.3 percent of Part B enrollees paid penalties (about 701,000 beneficiaries), according to the Congressional Research Service. On average, their total premiums were 31 percent higher than what they would have been.\\r\\nMedicare\u2019s prescription drug program (Part D) comes with a much less onerous late enrollment penalty, equal to 1 percent of the national base beneficiary premium for each month of delay. In 2019, the base monthly premium is $33.19, so a seven-month delay would tack $2.32 onto your plan\u2019s premium.\\r\\nLate enrollment also exposes you to significant gaps while waiting for Medicare coverage.\\r\\nMedicare has three enrollment periods. The Initial Enrollment Period includes the three months before you turn 65, the month of your 65th birthday and the three months after you turn 65. Coverage begins one to three months later, depending on when you enroll. For people transitioning from employer coverage at other ages, a Special Enrollment Period is available for eight months after other insurance ends, and coverage begins the first month after you enroll.\\r\\nBut late enrollees must wait for a General Enrollment Period that runs from Jan. 1 to March 31 each year \u2014 and Medicare coverage does not begin until July 1.\\r\\n\u201cThe penalties are bad enough, but the real risk is waiting for coverage to begin,\u201d said Joe Baker, president of the Medicare Rights Center, a consumer advocacy and policy group. \u201cYou face the risk of large out-of-pocket expenses, medical bills or debt, or inability to access care. It increases the reliance on emergency room care and creates needless health risks.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Farrell, for example, applied for Medicare one day after general enrollment ended, in April 2016. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize until too late that I had missed the deadline,\u201d he said. As a result, his Part B coverage did not begin until July 2017 \u2014 he was fortunate to find a commercial insurance policy to plug that gap while he waited.\\r\\nHere are the most common situations that lead to costly errors.\\r\\nIF YOU\u2019RE STILL EMPLOYED AT 65 People who are actively employed at age 65, and their spouses, may delay enrollment in Medicare. The key word here is \u201cactive,\u201d as Mr. Farrell discovered. \u201cCobra does not count as active employer group coverage,\u201d said Philip Moeller, author of Get What\u2019s Yours for Medicare: Maximize Your Coverage, Minimize Your Costs. \u201cIf you lost your employer coverage, you still need to sign up for Medicare when you turn 65.\u201d\\r\\nThere is one other exception to the active employment rule: If you work for a company with 20 or fewer employees, Medicare becomes the primary payer, so sign up when you turn 65.\\r\\n\u201cInsurers and employers audit this regularly, and if you become seriously ill, the insurer will realize you should have been on Medicare,\u201d Mr. Baker said. \u201cThey will refund your premiums but they also can claw back any payments they may have made that should have been covered by Medicare.\u201d\\r\\nIF YOU HAVE A HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNT More employers are offering high-deductible health insurance plans, and that is creating an additional complication for some workers when they retire and enroll in Medicare. These plans often are paired with tax-preferred Health Savings Accounts (H.S.A.s), which accept contributions from employers and workers to offset out-of-pocket expenses.\\r\\nH.S.A.s can accept contributions only from people enrolled in high-deductible plans \u2014 and Medicare does not meet that definition. Contributions must stop when you enroll in Medicare, although withdrawals can continue, and you\u2019ll owe taxes on any disallowed pretax contribution that you may have made. And the timing can be complicated, because Medicare Part A coverage is retroactive for six months for enrollees who qualify during those months. For those enrollees, H.S.A. contributions must stop six months before their Medicare effective date in order to avoid tax penalties.\\r\\nIF YOU ARE INSURED UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT Another common error is sticking past age 65 with a commercial policy obtained through the Affordable Care Act marketplace exchanges.\\r\\nFederal law requires that you switch to Medicare at age 65. Like Cobra, marketplace coverage is secondary to Medicare; switching to Medicare later must be done during the General Enrollment Period, leaving you exposed to possible long coverage delays like the one experienced by Mr. Farrell \u2014 plus penalties.\\r\\nInitially, people who made this mistake were required to repay any subsidies received for their policies, and they were subject to the standard late-enrollment penalties.\\r\\nWidespread confusion about the problem led the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to allow people to apply for relief from the late enrollment penalties. The relief allows some people to end their exchange coverage and enroll in Part B without penalties or gaps in coverage, and in other cases to have their penalties reduced. The relief is available through September of this year.\\r\\nDetails are available on this Medicare fact sheet.\\r\\nIF YOU ARE ON RETIREE COVERAGE Some retirees receive coverage from former employers that supplement Medicare \u2014 typically help with meeting cost-sharing requirements or prescription drug coverage. Retiree benefits always are secondary payers to Medicare. A common error is turning down Part B coverage in the belief that this supplemental coverage is primary \u2014 and ending up with no primary coverage.\\r\\nIn this situation, late Medicare sign-up must be done during the General Enrollment Period, and exposes you to late enrollment penalties.\\r\\nThere\u2019s a push for change\\r\\nIf the rules governing the transition to Medicare sound complicated, rest assured that experts agree. \u201cMoving into Medicare from other kinds of health insurance can be so complicated that it should be a required chapter in Retirement 101,\u201d Mr. Moeller said.\\r\\nThe only government warning about the risks associated with late enrollment comes in the form of a very brief notice near the end of the annual Social Security Administration statement of benefits.\\r\\nThe Medicare Rights Center and other advocacy groups have proposed legislation that would require the federal government to notify people approaching eligibility about enrollment rules, and how Medicare works with other types of insurance. The legislation \u2014 the Beneficiary Enrollment Notification and Eligibility Simplification Act, also would eliminate coverage gaps now experienced by enrollees during the Initial Enrollment Period and General Enrollment Period. The legislation was introduced in Congress last year, and will be reintroduced this year.\\r\\nIn the meantime, Mr. Baker proposes a simple rule of thumb to help people approaching Medicare eligibility to avoid costly errors.\\r\\n\u201cIf you are eligible for Medicare, you should really consider it to be your default, primary coverage. If you are going to decline Medicare, think very carefully and take the time to really understand all the rules.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-163419452,\"description\":\"When signing up for the health coverage, timing and coordination are everything.

Opioid drugs do have a place in pain management, and if used properly, they should not pose a danger of addiction. And publicity around the opioid epidemic should not get in the way of prescribing the most effective drugs to children with serious illnesses and terrible pain.\\r\\nDr. Linda J. Mason, a professor of anesthesia and pediatrics at Loma Linda University and the president of the society, emphasized that parents should understand that \u201cthere are alternatives to opioid pain management\u201d and that they should be asking questions of their children\u2019s doctors. And when children do take opioid medications, Dr. Mason said, parents need to understand how the medicines can be safely stored, and how any leftover doses can be disposed of.\\r\\n\u201cOpioids are very potent relievers of pain, very effective,\u201d Dr. Mason said. \u201cBut they have addictive properties, and also side effects, like respiratory depression.\u201d When she takes care of a child having surgery, Dr. Mason said, she may start with opioids and then move on quickly to other drugs.\\r\\nDr. Elliot J. Krane, professor of anesthesiology and pediatrics at Stanford University and chief of pain management at the Packard Children\u2019s Hospital at Stanford, noted that the pain-relieving properties of opium poppy plants were discovered 5,000 years ago, in ancient Mesopotamia. \u201cWhy are we still using a 5,000-year-old drug? Because they work,\u201d he said.\\r\\nBut they are also drugs with dangerous side effects, including respiratory depression, and they raise serious issues of abuse and addiction.\\r\\nSome studies have shown connections between prescription opioid use in the young and later misuse; Dr. Krane and his colleagues have argued that the data do not support this as a causal relationship, and that the risk of addiction is tied to genetic and psychological vulnerability and not merely exposure. He was a co-author of a 2018 editorial in the journal Pediatrics that called for collecting much more data about the use and misuse of opioids in children.\\r\\nDr. Krane said that he and his colleagues avoid opioids when there are alternatives, because of concern about side effects. In an email he wrote that, as one of his colleagues says, he is \u201cneither pro-opioid nor anti-opioid, but pro-patient.\u201d He wrote: \u201cA very small percent of my chronic pain patients are prescribed opioids, no more than five to 10 at any time out of many hundreds of children and teens in my patient panel.\u201d\\r\\nBut he argued that, based on the data on misuse and addiction, \u201cin the absence of risk factors or concerns about the child\u2019s home environment, I am more concerned about deleterious effects of untreated pain than I am about creating somebody with substance abuse disorder.\u201d And opioid abuse is not an overriding concern, he said, \u201cin children or adolescents who are prescribed them rationally and appropriately.\u201d\\r\\nThere is definitely a new onus on doctors to make sure that the prescribing is rational and appropriate, especially around some of the most common situations in which opioids are prescribed, including dental procedures, orthopedic procedures and emergency room visits. \\r\\nOf course, the prescribing doctor should know if a patient may be especially vulnerable to addiction, whether because of warning signs in the family history, psychiatric disease or adolescent experimenting.\\r\\n\u201cTraditionally, oral surgeons tended to be among the highest prescribers of opioids to adolescents,\u201d said Dr. Charles Berde, the founder of the division of pain medicine at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital. With the proactive use of acetaminophen and ibuprofen around the clock, he said, most adolescents who had their wisdom teeth extracted did not need any oxycodone at all. And for those who do, he said, \u201cfour pills is enough to cover the great majority of kids.\u201d\\r\\nIn the past, Dr. Mason said, children were often prescribed too many pills, which can contribute to the risk of using the medication longer than strictly necessary, and to leftover doses remaining in the medicine cabinet.\\r\\n\u201cYou should not keep them for use for a future time,\u201d Dr. Mason said. \u201cThese are for a specific surgery,\u201d and any that remain should be disposed of, not left around to be perhaps used by another family member, or found by an exploring toddler \u2014 or visiting adolescent. She recommended taking them to a local pharmacy or health center, or to a police station, or else mixing them with dirt or kitty litter before throwing them away.\\r\\nA study published in December in JAMA Pediatrics found a threefold increase in the mortality rate among children and adolescents from opioid poisoning, both by prescription drugs and by illicit drugs, over the past two decades. In addition to deaths among adolescents, the rate increased markedly among children under 4, underscoring the need to store these drugs safely and dispose of any leftover doses.\\r\\nPediatric orthopedists are looking at whether children need any opioids at all in certain situations, said Dr. Joshua M. Abzug, the director of pediatric orthopedics and deputy surgeon in chief at the University of Maryland Children\u2019s Hospital, who was the co-author of a 2018 review article on managing pediatric orthopedic pain in the setting of the opioid epidemic. And when they do need them, he said, doctors should limit the prescriptions to only the few pills that the child is likely to need.\\r\\nIt\u2019s important to start at the preoperative evaluation, Dr. Abzug said, and set expectations with both the child and the parent, acknowledging that the child may have some pain, but it should not be overwhelming, and \u201cwe can combat that pain with other medications.\u201d\\r\\nImportant strategies for orthopedic surgeries, he said, include long-acting injectable local anesthetics, which can decrease the need of opioids, and multimodal pain relief by mixing different kinds of drugs, such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, like ibuprofen.\\r\\n\u201cIf the child does need an opioid, that\u2019s O.K., we don\u2019t want them writhing in pain,\u201d Dr. Abzug said. The child should then shift, as soon as possible, to other medications.\\r\\nAnd while everyone is profoundly aware of the risks associated with opioids, the most important message of pain management is that pain needs to be managed. \u201cTreating pain adequately helps recovery, reduces the downstream psychiatric and psychological effects,\u201d said Dr. Krane.\\r\\nNot treating pain adequately may cause post-traumatic stress disorder, said Dr. Stefan Friedrichsdorf, the medical director of pain medicine and palliative care at Children\u2019s Minnesota. Opioids are important for children after major surgery, trauma or burns, he said, and certainly for those in palliative care,\\r\\nParents whose children will need pain control \u2014 after an injury, after an operation, after a dental extraction \u2014 should ask questions, Dr. Abzug said. Even for injuries like bone fractures, it is often enough to alternate anti-inflammatory medications and acetaminophen.\\r\\nAsk about options, ask about local or regional anesthesia, ask about who will be available if the pain medication \u2014 whatever it is \u2014 proves insufficient.\\r\\nAnd after considering all the alternatives, if opioids are necessary, parents need to be vigilant about supervising the dosage, and properly disposing of extra pills.\\r\\nDr. Mason suggested asking, \u201cWhat would be good for my child\u2019s pain as we transition out of the first 24 hours?\u201d Ask about the side effects, she said, ask about what to do with drugs that are left over. \u201cParents who are well-informed can give the best care to their children.\u201d\\r\\nThis is the fourth in a series of columns on children\u2019s pain.

Many efforts have been made, with varied success, to correct this problem. Yet we\u2019ve usually focused on physician behavior, when there\u2019s another powerful lever: pharmacists.\\r\\nAbout 30 percent of older adults in the United States and Canada filled a prescription in the last few years for one of many medications that the American Geriatrics Society recommends they avoid. Such drugs can lead to more harm \u2014 like cognitive impairment or falls \u2014 than good, and often safer options are available.\\r\\n\u201cOlder adults are taking an awful lot of pills these days \u2014 66 percent take five drugs or more per day, and 27 percent take 10 or more per day \u2014 so if some of those pills are no longer necessary and may even be causing harm, why not ask if it is time to deprescribe?\u201d said Dr. Cara Tannenbaum, a professor of medicine and pharmacy at the University of Montreal, and director of the Canadian Deprescribing Network.\\r\\nIt\u2019s not easy to get patients off such drugs, though. Physicians often don\u2019t have enough information about what patients are taking, or may lack the time to talk to patients about these medications. They fear that stopping the drugs might cause harm or make patients upset.\\r\\nTo explore the possible role of pharmacists, Dr. Tannenbaum conducted a large randomized controlled trial over four years in community pharmacies in Quebec. The results of the study were recently published in JAMA.\\r\\nPatients 65 years or older were randomly assigned to one of two groups. In the intervention group, pharmacists gave both patients and their physicians educational materials on the specific drug that might have been inappropriately prescribed. Such brochures could be delivered by mail or in person. The control group got the usual care, with no educational materials.\\r\\nDrugs that were targets for deprescribing included sedatives, first-generation antihistamines, glyburide (used to treat diabetes), and certain nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, like ibuprofen or naproxen. The main outcome of interest was the ending of a prescription for one of the four medication classes six months later.\\r\\nAlmost 500 patients, average age 75, participated in the trial, and about 90 percent of them completed it. The intervention made a difference. Within six months, 43 percent of the patients in the intervention group had stopped taking one of the selected medicines. The corresponding figure was 12 percent in the control group.\\r\\nIn medicine, we often focus on the traditional doctor\/patient interaction. We tend to ignore practitioners who come into contact with patients more than physicians, who in this case could hand over brochures personally. In the study, pharmacists were also paid to send information to the patients\u2019 doctors ($19 Canadian, equivalent to $14 American, per physician outreach).  \\r\\nSimilar studies trying to enlist pharmacists are rare, but not unknown. In a 1996 study in the American Journal of Medicine that randomly assigned 208 patients, half of them had a pharmacist in a Veterans Affairs Medical Center review their medications and make recommendations to their physician. This resulted in improvements in prescriptions in 24 percent of patients versus 6 percent in usual care. \\r\\nA 1998 study published in JAMA encouraged pharmacists to contact physicians by alerts when they were employing drugs that were not ideal in the care of older people. They were able to reach physicians just over half the time and saw changes in prescriptions about a quarter of the time. This was not a controlled trial, however. \\r\\nA 2014 study in JAMA Internal Medicine focused on direct-to-consumer educational materials from pharmacists to reduce inappropriate benzodiazepine prescriptions for older people. It worked 27 percent of the time compared with 5 percent in usual care. A 2001 study in the Canadian Medical Association Journal focused on messages sent to physicians only, and found no significant changes.\\r\\nDr. Tannenbaum, author of the recent JAMA study, thought that communication was essential to her project\u2019s results: \u201cWe first asked primary care providers what information they needed to safely deprescribe patients\u2019 medications,\u201d she said. \u201cBased on the physicians\u2019 answers, we provided pharmacists with a template on how best to communicate the evidence about deprescribing to physicians. When pharmacists equipped patients with the same information, applied specifically to medications the patient had been taking for a while, everyone was on board and keen to initiate a conversation.\u201d\\r\\nOf course, this study took place in Canada, and pharmacists\u2019 scope of practice may differ in parts of the United States. The pharmacists were also reimbursed for physician contact, which might not occur in the United States. Pharmacists have seen increases in their scope, especially with respect to contraception in Oregon and California, which tend to be supported by patients as well.\\r\\nMuch like another recent study involving barbershops (and pharmacists), this study provides evidence that seemingly intractable problems can be overcome by expanding the focus of our interventions. There are many more professionals involved in health care besides physicians. They can help make health care better. \",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1705918815,\"description\":\"Are people relying too much on the traditional doctor\/patient interaction?\\r\",\"title\":\"The New Health Care: The Unsung Role of the Pharmacist in Patient Health\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"health.32.txt\"}],\"labelMap\":[[-1470032073,\"business\"],[1620813714,\"business\"],[391006090,\"world\"],[1668447843,\"business\"],[-1492412555,\"world\"],[-1004715158,\"business\"],[-727259249,\"technology\"],[1884837133,\"science\"],[-1501740769,\"technology\"],[-634690071,\"health\"],[1125083330,\"science\"],[1229292121,\"health\"],[411863084,\"world\"],[-1361980079,\"world\"],[489669537,\"world\"],[-1709632295,\"business\"],[326879815,\"science\"],[650611067,\"technology\"],[494067761,\"health\"],[1957449218,\"technology\"],[-582939649,\"technology\"],[-1116953762,\"health\"],[-1521949661,\"world\"],[-1309279343,\"world\"],[-1781385766,\"technology\"],[-1919147376,\"technology\"],[288498403,\"world\"],[254470884,\"technology\"],[1823608100,\"technology\"],[-583240374,\"health\"],[2025704318,\"science\"],[-96237933,\"world\"],[409830808,\"technology\"],[829092437,\"health\"],[-957075741,\"health\"],[-1986019822,\"technology\"],[-990418623,\"health\"],[2064830945,\"technology\"],[-1418713501,\"world\"],[-1904714508,\"technology\"],[-2030941738,\"business\"],[-1059350140,\"world\"],[-976253369,\"world\"],[1254265346,\"technology\"],[1792994965,\"health\"],[65063940,\"health\"],[-2122718852,\"health\"],[-1045290466,\"technology\"],[1189967463,\"health\"],[-1070819612,\"health\"],[-1529928416,\"health\"],[2059735833,\"technology\"],[-373522571,\"technology\"],[-2146313290,\"health\"],[511430857,\"technology\"],[1502437256,\"technology\"],[-825453762,\"business\"],[1425051396,\"world\"],[-1250615417,\"health\"],[-324448097,\"health\"],[-164165755,\"health\"],[1989778916,\"technology\"],[1028732566,\"health\"],[-1284555762,\"technology\"],[-811301431,\"business\"],[-403065203,\"technology\"],[1705918815,\"health\"],[-337178062,\"world\"],[450095445,\"technology\"],[-1473343492,\"world\"],[1441898756,\"technology\"],[-1858430965,\"health\"],[927570284,\"business\"],[51690786,\"business\"],[-1300585391,\"business\"],[-1639301803,\"business\"],[1512981334,\"business\"],[750586142,\"health\"],[-941067625,\"technology\"],[389591184,\"technology\"],[-1222156594,\"business\"],[-90301954,\"business\"],[-1469931254,\"business\"],[-158380165,\"technology\"],[1984659120,\"world\"],[2130086515,\"world\"],[-163419452,\"health\"]],\"confusionMatrix\":[[5,6,0,6,1],[0,4,0,1,1],[1,1,0,2,1],[4,0,2,12,1],[4,4,0,1,9]],\"confusionLabels\":[\"business\",\"health\",\"science\",\"technology\",\"world\"],\"relabelingLabelMap\":[[-1781385766,\"technology\"],[-1309279343,\"world\"],[-1116953762,\"health\"],[-582939649,\"technology\"],[494067761,\"health\"],[650611067,\"technology\"],[326879815,\"science\"],[-1709632295,\"business\"],[489669537,\"world\"],[411863084,\"world\"],[1125083330,\"science\"],[-634690071,\"health\"],[-1501740769,\"technology\"],[-727259249,\"technology\"],[-1492412555,\"world\"],[1668447843,\"business\"],[1792994965,\"health\"],[-2122718852,\"health\"],[-164165755,\"health\"],[1028732566,\"health\"],[1705918815,\"health\"],[-1222156594,\"world\"]],\"accuracy\":0.5057471264367817,\"correctRelabeled\":[-582939649,494067761,326879815,-1501740769,1792994965,-2122718852,-164165755,1028732566,1705918815],\"labelingPrecision\":0.42857142857142855,\"labelingRecall\":0.20930232558139536,\"correctAssignedItems\":[-1116953762,-582939649,494067761,326879815,-1709632295,1125083330,-1501740769,-1492412555,1668447843,1792994965,-2122718852,-164165755,1028732566,1705918815],\"assignmentPrecision\":0.42857142857142855,\"openedItems\":[],\"numOpenedItems\":0,\"selectedItems\":[],\"selectedInCategory\":0,\"selectionRecall\":null},{\"modelOperation\":\"add\",\"changedFiles\":[{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"TORONTO \u2014 The Rev.

But Ms. Vosper does not believe in God either. Instead, the parable says more about her determination. Despite being an outspoken atheist, Ms. Vosper has steadfastly maintained her place in the United Church of Canada, which with two million followers across the country is Canada\u2019s pre-eminent Protestant church.\\r\\n\u201cThis is my church,\u201d said Ms. Vosper, 60. \u201cThe United Church made me who I am.\u201d\\r\\nIn a country where thinning congregations have led to many church sanctuaries being converted into condominiums, Ms. Vosper\u2019s outspoken views have stirred an existential passion.

In 2015, a public letter she wrote sparked so much ire, the local jurisdiction of the church launched a review committee to examine her beliefs.\\r\\nAfter a much-publicized hearing, which she called a \u201cheresy trial,\u201d the local panel ruled her \u201cunsuitable\u201d for ministry since she \u201cdoes not believe in God, Jesus Christ or the Holy Spirit.\u201d She was on the verge of being defrocked. But, just as the national church\u2019s final review of her case began last November, the local jurisdiction settled with Ms. Vosper and agreed she could continue to minister her congregation in Toronto\u2019s gritty east end.\\r\\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t alter in any way the belief of The United Church of Canada in God,\u201d the church announced, to the confusion of many. Since the terms of the settlement are confidential, congregants were left to divine for themselves what these two seemingly contradictory positions meant.\\r\\n\u201cSo, everyone has to be included, including an atheist minister? It\u2019s nonsense,\u201d said Bruce Sanguin, who led Ms. Vosper\u2019s congregation before moving to Canada\u2019s west coast. \u201cDoes the United Church stand for anything? Is it just the New Democratic Party \u2014 a socialist party \u2014 at prayer?\u201d\\r\\nDavid Giuliano, the church\u2019s leader from 2006 to 2009, compared Ms. Vosper to an Amazon manager who doesn\u2019t believe in online shopping. \u201cI suppose someone could have the skills to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut why would she want to?\u201d\\r\\nMs. Vosper has felt she belongs in the church since she was a child, growing up in a rambling house in the university town of Kingston, Ontario, with a view of one of its stony steeples from her bedroom window. The family would all bundle up and go there on Sundays, and both her parents \u2014 an engineer and a nurse \u2014 were active members.\\r\\nAlthough as a child, she claimed Jesus had taught her to skate, she never considered herself a devotee. Instead, she says she has always understood God obliquely, as love.\\r\\nAfter graduating from college with an arts degree and in search of adventure, Ms. Vosper moved to the far north of Canada, where she was married and had a daughter. After her marriage broke down, she returned to Kingston as a single mother and enrolled in divinity school.\\r\\n\u201cI wanted to learn how to make the world a better place through it,\u201d said Ms. Vosper, who is sprightly, with short salt-and-pepper hair, chunky glasses and a penchant for bubbling over with language.\\r\\nBy then, the United Church of Canada was propelled more by social justice than theology, according to Kevin Flatt, author of \u201cAfter Evangelicalism: The 60s and the United Church.\u201d The first church to ordain transgender ministers, its leadership supported abortion and same-sex union before either became legal in Canada.\\r\\nDivinity school cemented her metaphorical views of God, Ms. Vosper says. But once she began preaching, she realized many congregants thought she was talking about an all-knowing, all-seeing spirit who answered prayers and called some to heaven and others to hell.\\r\\n\u201cI realized how little of what I said got through to anyone,\u201d said Ms. Vosper.\\r\\n\u201cWe were caught in the story of Christianity that was centuries and centuries and centuries old, regardless of the fact we could say with a lot of confidence that the story was not entirely true \u2014 even its most important and sacred beliefs,\u201d she added. \u201cOnce I realized that, then I was kind of screwed.\u201d\\r\\nSo, four years after she was hired at West Hill United Church in 1997, she delivered a sermon called \u201cDeconstructing God,\u201d laying bare her disbelief in a theistic God.\\r\\nShe recalls congregation members hugging her afterward.\\r\\n\u201cMost of the congregation was in a similar place theologically,\u201d said Debbie Ellis, a member at West Hill for more than two decades. \u201cThe idea of a savior from our sins keeping us from actual eternal damnation was not something many believed in.\u201d\\r\\nSince then, Ms. Vosper has slowly stripped away the traditional biblical language from her Sunday \u201cweekly gatherings.\u201d In its place, she put words and rituals that reflected her congregation\u2019s agreed beliefs \u2014 love, justice, compassion, integrity, forgiveness.\\r\\nTo sit through a service at West Hill United is to feel like you\u2019re watching an old classic film that has been dubbed into a different language.\\r\\nInstead of the Lord\u2019s Prayer, the congregation recites the \u201cWords of Commitment,\u201d which Ms. Vosper wrote with her third husband, the church\u2019s musical director, Scott Kearns. They stand to sing humanist hymns dedicated to peace and love that the two also wrote.\\r\\nMs. Vosper gave up her robe and ordination stole, which she had lovingly stitched herself, using swaths from her life including part of her childhood living room curtains. She dresses like any other member of the congregation and preaches while walking the aisles between them.\\r\\nOn a recent Sunday, she pointed out a lantern near the pulpit, lit up by many wicks that were tied together by the members of the congregation.\\r\\nTo her, the close relationships between congregants is the definition of God.\\r\\n\u201cI see us as beams of light between each of us, and that light is a source of strength and encouragement and courage and bravado sometimes and peace and healing,\u201d she said.\\r\\nShe wears a wick around her left wrist.\\r\\nFor years, Ms. Vosper seemed to hanker for a \u201cheresy trial\u201d in her op-eds, public statements and books. But the church, which has made \u201cinclusivity\u201d a core principle, would not be goaded, even after Ms. Vosper publicly announced she was an atheist in 2013.\\r\\nThat changed in 2015, after Ms. Vosper\u2019s public letter which reprimanded the church\u2019s moderator for his prayer for victims of the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris.\\r\\nThe prayer asked a Gracious God to \u201clead us to seek comfort, compassion and peace, in the face of escalating violence around the world.\u201d\\r\\nMs. Vosper still considers the prayer \u201cegregious.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cGod is not the power that allows that to happen,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe have the responsibility to make that happen ourselves.\u201d\\r\\nOnce the hearing was launched, Ms. Vosper\u2019s congregation of self-described agnostics and atheists rallied behind her. They traveled across the country, holding discussions and raising  80,000 Canadian dollars, about $59,000, for her legal fees.\\r\\nBut the storm her positions whipped up was nasty. Ms. Vosper had an alarm system installed in her home and was forced to wear a panic button at work, as a precaution.\\r\\nAs the hearing dates dragged on, she went on stress leave for months, and could no longer muster the energy to write songs or fashion jewelry, which she loves to do.\\r\\nShe had wanted a \u201crich and vibrant conversation\u201d about the church\u2019s language, she said. Instead, she found herself fighting for her job. Although she won, she does not feel particularly victorious.\\r\\nJust before the final hearing was about to start, another storm hit her church, and water poured through the roof flooding the sanctuary.\\r\\nA biblical person might read meaning into that, but not Ms. Vosper.\\r\\n\u201cIt just made it more difficult for us,\u201d she said.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1655058251,\"description\":\"The Rev.

It is a glorious shot, hair flying, stance low, a white-water trail streaming behind me to the lip of the wave.\\r\\n\u201cSo what do we see here, Bonnie?\u201d asks Jessie Carnes, one of the resort\u2019s four owners and my coach for the week. What the screen doesn\u2019t yet show, but what she and I both know: It\u2019s the moment right before I biff the wave and fly face-first into the Pacific.\\r\\nWhat\u2019s different from every other time I biff it face-first, though, is that this time I can see that both of my hands are coming too far forward into the turn, pitching my upper body toward the water. I say so, and Ms. Carnes rewards me with a radiant grin.\\r\\n\u201cExactly,\u201d she says, advancing the video so that we see the ensuing fall in real time. \u201cKeep your head up and your hands over the rails\u201d \u2014 left hand over the left side of the board, right hand over the right side \u2014 \u201cand your weight will stay over the board driving into the turn.\u201d\\r\\nIt\u2019s late November here at the brand-new Surf Simply resort in Nosara, Costa Rica, where up to eight cameras were trained on me and the other 11 guests in the water during the morning\u2019s surf session. Within the hour, video footage was loaded onto the resort\u2019s private server and edited into a personal highlight reel, cut with skill-building lessons that are customized for each surfer. The coaches then run through a \u201ctheory\u201d session with that surfer, going over the tape and running drills to improve performance.\\r\\nThe founder of Surf Simply, Ru Hill, moved here from England and started teaching out of his car in 2007; three years later, he opened the original coaching resort a short distance from Playa Guiones, a four-mile span of white-sand beach featuring some of the most consistent surf in the world. Since then, Surf Simply has become a premier surf destination, one that routinely gets booked out a year in advance. \\r\\nLast year, Mr. Hill and his partners \u2014 Ms. Carnes, Daniela Acosta and Harry Knight \u2014 started building an ecologically thoughtful but technologically sophisticated new iteration of the resort: An intimate, minimalist building tucked under the jungle canopy, bordering the Reserva Biol\u00f3gica Nosara, with a walking path right to Playa Guiones. The four entrepreneurs hired Gensler \u2014 the renowned San Francisco design firm behind such projects as the original Apple stores, Facebook headquarters and Seoul Incheon International Airport \u2014 to bring it to reality. They officially moved into the new digs a month before my visit.\\r\\nWith this in mind, I can\u2019t help but think that the new video-coaching room is kind of like being inside an iPhone, one that\u2019s loaded with surf tutorials, raw film footage from all angles and an app for personalized analysis. Welcome to Surf Simply 2.0.\\r\\nSurf Nerds Unite\\r\\nI live in the Bay Area and have been surfing off and on for about a decade, with two babies thrown in there. Like a lot of intermediate surfers, I\u2019ve dabbled in lessons over the years, but I always wondered if there was a better way than the ethereal, \u201cfeel the wave\u201d instruction that doesn\u2019t translate to actual skills. Most days, surfing seems to happens in a vacuum; even when you have a dedicated surf posse, as I do at San Francisco\u2019s Ocean Beach, there\u2019s never really a reliable witness to tell you what you did, right or wrong.\\r\\nWhat sets Surf Simply apart from other surf camps is the extreme specificity of technical instruction, and that\u2019s what my three-woman surf crew \u2014 Caroline, Sarah and Harper \u2014 and I were after when we planned this trip a year and a half before. Every coaching session relies on a logical progression that instructors call the \u201ctree of knowledge,\u201d a road map of skills that connects the dots from entry-level surfer to competitor (in the spirit of community, it\u2019s available free online to anyone who wants it). \\r\\nThe daily schedule is posted on a blackboard by the open-air dining room: two-a-day surfs; lectures about surfboard mechanics, wave forecasting, etiquette and duck-diving; stretching classes by Andreina Poletti, an impossibly fit and plucky sports conditioning coach from the capital city of San Jos\u00e9. All of it is punctuated with fresh, creative meals by the supremely gifted Denis Madrigal, who has worked in some of New York\u2019s most storied kitchens, including the Palm. Oh, and did I mention the massages, the pool and the open bar?\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the N.F.L. postgame practice met your honeymoon and they had a baby,\u201d Caroline mused on the third morning as we walked back from the beach, surfboards in hand, adjusting pace as little crabs the fiery red of stop signs scuttled across our path.\\r\\nThe ideal audience for this data-driven approach to surfing includes Trevor Ault, 43, a mechanical engineer who was visiting Surf Simply for the third time with his wife, Paige Morgan, 46, a commercial real estate broker. \u201cSeven hundred and 65 calories,\u201d he said proudly, showing me the morning\u2019s readout on his surf app. The GPS and gyroscope inside his smartwatch helped map the zigzag course of his various wave trajectories, tallying the ones he made and the ones he didn\u2019t, and recording wave speed, distance, time and energy expenditure for the entire session (impressively high, thanks to the effort required to paddle over the six- to eight-foot waves that morning). Data, he reminded me, is your friend.\\r\\nI also met Tiffany Joh, 31, a professional golfer on the L.P.G.A. Tour. Six years ago, she was coming off her worst season on the tour and lost her tour card. Before starting the uphill climb to requalify, she took a week off from golf and learned to surf. She now visits Surf Simply during every off season to improve her skills.\\r\\n\u201cSurfing and golf are similar in that they are so frustrating: You\u2019re waiting for 95 percent of the time, but then you\u2019ll get one really good wave or hit one really good shot, and you\u2019ll feel amazing,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cThey\u2019re also both very technical. Golf is about reading slopes on the greens, matching speed with your line. There\u2019s creativity in how you do that, but you need the technical fundamentals first. Same with surfing: You need the fundamentals before you can get creative and \u2018feel the wave.\u2019\u201d\\r\\nI think about how much golf and ski magazines are devoted to improving your skills, whether it\u2019s putting or backcountry safety. Then I think about surf magazines, which are almost entirely devoted to pretty aquamarine pictures of waves with awesome surfers on them. Here in Nosara, you have the chance to live inside that pretty picture, with the technical tools to help you belong there.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreading Lightly\\r\\nEverything about the resort itself enables this flow to and from the ocean, with an emphasis on indoor-outdoor living. Guests can select any surfboard they like from the board room, a spacious, teak-beamed shed, and place their picks on racks under little chalkboards marked with their names. The beach path is  adjacent to the board room, and three outdoor showers are situated right at the steps back up to the resort\u2019s pool and hot tub. Each guest room is designed for the surfer returning from a session; the generous glass-walled shower has numerous hooks inside and out, to hang rash guards and suits.\\r\\nOne morning in the pre-dawn hour, I appreciated the unexpected juxtaposition of jazz piping out of the dining room with the raawrerRAAAWRrerroarerrawer of howler monkeys in the trees 15 feet overhead. Later, I saw one howler curled up into a tiny ball on a branch above the pool, and marveled at what a big sound a little monkey can make.\\r\\nThe entire operation will be platinum LEED-certified and tries to have a light footprint. Nearly half its energy needs are supplied by rooftop solar, and wastewater is used for irrigation, eliminating sewage output and saving more than 50 percent in public water use over the previous resort. Mr. Hill and his team are also relaunching their children\u2019s surf camp, offering free lessons and video coaching every Saturday morning to encourage local children to join the beach community. One student from the original children\u2019s camp is about to come full circle, returning to Surf Simply as a newly hired 21-year-old instructor.\\r\\nA week at Surf Simply starts at about $4,500 per person, double occupancy ($3,500 if your partner doesn\u2019t surf), including lodging, food, drinks, massages, photos and video footage and transport to and from the airport. How does one justify the cost of professional coaching as a nonprofessional? Here, I think again about golf and skiing \u2014 greens fees alone can top $2,000 for seven days, and what of lessons, lift tickets, gear, lodging, meals and all the rest? Caroline, Harper, Sarah and I decided that amortizing the cost of happiness over a lifetime of surfing makes the trip more than worthwhile; we\u2019d have loads of new skills to take home with us to practice, and surfing on our home break costs nearly nothing. \\r\\nBy and large, though, people keep coming back for more: Mr. Hill said that 37 percent of guests are return visitors, many of whom come back in the company of those they\u2019ve met here. One all-star guest, Reid Winkler, an orthodontist from Seattle, had traveled to Surf Simply a record 12 times and already had his next two trips scheduled. \u201cI\u2019ve made a lot of good friends here,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s the school for surf nerds \u2014 but it\u2019s the coolest nerds you\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\\r\\nBruce and Abby Hutchinson, from New London, N.H., were on their fourth trip to Surf Simply. Before their first visit, in 2015, they had never been surfing. \u201cWe love to try new things,\u201d said Mr. Hutchinson, 63, said. They liked the thrill of riding waves, and they also liked the effort to demystify it. \u201cHere, the objective is not to just stand up on the board, but to get better every time.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s the cumulation of sound instruction in skills and the confidence to work on something new, with the group cheering you on,\u201d added Mrs. Hutchinson, 62. \u201cThat\u2019s really special.\u201d\\r\\nIt was during Ms. Carnes\u2019s breath-hold lecture \u2014 lying down in the stretching room with friends both new and old, entering the third minute of holding my breath while pretending to be held under by a giant wave \u2014 that it came to me: This was the ultimate Venn diagram of surfing and geekery. And I had never felt more at home.\\r\\nBonnie Tsui is a writer based in Berkeley, Calif.

Few would know that ordering rock salmon, which can refer to several species of small shark, could mean they were eating an endangered species.\\r\\nThe researchers analyzed the DNA of more than 100 samples from takeout restaurants, fishmongers and a wholesaler, mainly in the south of England.\\r\\nAlthough the spiny dogfish is classed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, selling it for food in Britain is not necessarily illegal. The European Union in 2011 banned commercial targeting of the shark in the North Atlantic, but the species is still picked up unintentionally as bycatch.\\r\\nThe study published on Thursday called for a change in labeling rules to show more clearly what kind of fish was being used.\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible for consumers to know what they are buying,\u201d said Catherine Hobbs, the study\u2019s lead author. \u201cPeople might think they\u2019re getting a sustainably sourced product when they\u2019re actually buying a threatened species.\u201d\\r\\nThe paper found that imprecise terms not only blurred the lines between species but also made allergens, mercury levels and conservation status hard to identify.\\r\\nAnd consumers were not the only ones confused.

Brach\u2019s hearts come in many flavors and are generally a little thinner and softer than Sweethearts, and they are laser-printed rather than stamped.\\r\\nMs. Pake used to keep Sweethearts in a glass dish in her kitchen, and in a wooden box at her office.

It was one of the oldest candy companies in the United States, and its famous Necco Wafers \u2014 sugary disks that were first manufactured during the 1800s \u2014 could travel so well that they were shipped to American troops overseas during World War II. Sweethearts appeared around the turn of the 20th century, and in the decades since, Wafers and Sweethearts (which were made from similar, but not identical, ingredients) have earned reputations as quintessential American candies. Before the factory closed, Necco was producing billions of Sweethearts every year.\\r\\nTom Hoeck, a founder of CandyStore.com, which sells candy in bulk, said he could understand the interest in conversation hearts. \u201cIt\u2019s part nostalgia, because I remember being in grade school and sharing them with friends,\u201d he said. \u201cI like them. I think they\u2019re a cool candy.\u201d\\r\\nBased on its own sales and some additional information from partners and distributors, CandyStore.com said it found that conversation hearts of all brands were the most popular Valentine\u2019s Day candy in 2017 and 2018 in terms of sales by weight, edging out heart-shaped boxes of chocolate. (The data did not suggest that the hearts were more popular than chocolate over all.)\\r\\nThe company\u2019s blog has covered Necco\u2019s ups and downs and helped to raise the alarm about the Sweethearts shortage. In January, Sweethearts devotees started emailing the distributor about the candy on a daily \u2014 and then an hourly \u2014 basis, Mr. Hoeck said.\\r\\nBut this is not the first time people have panicked about Necco products. The factory in Revere, Mass., struggled to stay afloat for years, and in March, The Boston Globe reported that it was in danger of closing. This led to what CandyStore.com called \u201cThe Great Necco Wafer Panic\u201d of 2018, in which customers rushed to buy the small sugary disks in bulk.\\r\\nThen, as now, CandyStore.com got hundreds of emails, Mr. Hoeck said. Some people offered to pay surge prices for wafers, and one woman offered her car in exchange for a shipment, he said. The online distributor ran out of both Wafers and Sweethearts last year.\\r\\n\u201cPeople are thinking we\u2019re the ones that bought Necco, and asking when we are going to bring back Necco,\u201d Mr. Hoeck said. (In September, Spangler Candy Company, an Ohio business known for its Dum Dums and Circus Peanuts, announced that it had bought Necco Wafers and Sweethearts brands.)\\r\\nIn the meantime, Brach\u2019s was ramping up production of its conversation hearts to meet any extra demand for this Valentine\u2019s Day, said Hans Becher, the general manager of seasonal confections at Ferrara Candy Company, which owns Brach\u2019s.\\r\\nAnd for those whose hearts belong to Necco, there may yet be some hope.\\r\\nIn a statement in September, Kirk Vashaw, Spangler\u2019s chief executive, said the company looked forward to announcing that it would bring Sweethearts back in time for Valentine\u2019s Day 2020.

Any effort to get tough on the United States \u2014 such as by detaining American nationals, as it did to Canadians after Ms. Meng was arrested \u2014 could scuttle the negotiations.\\r\\nThose talks are set to resume on Wednesday, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said in a television interview on Tuesday that the case against Ms. Meng would not affect them.\\r\\n\u201cForced technology issues are part of trade discussions,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said, while emphasizing that any issues related \u201cto violation of U.S. law or U.S. sanctions are going through a separate track, which is the Justice Department.\u201d\\r\\nHuawei\u2019s Washington operations have undergone drastic turnover as it appears to rein in its sales ambitions in America and shift tactics in its relations with the government. In the second shake-up of its American leadership in less than a year, the company is replacing Regent Zhang, its head of government affairs in Washington, with Joy Tan, currently its head of global communications.\\r\\nThe broad language of the Justice Department\u2019s indictments suggests that other Huawei leaders, including Mr. Ren, a former officer in the People\u2019s Liberation Army, might wish to exercise caution while traveling to countries that have an extradition treaty with the United States.\\r\\n\u201cIf I was his lawyer, I would advise him to be careful,\u201d said Julian Ku, a professor of law at Hofstra University.\\r\\nBut that kind of caution could make it harder still for Huawei to hold on to its business in places like Europe. Already, the United States has been applying pressure on all sides against Huawei, fearing that the Chinese government could use the company\u2019s gear to sabotage other countries\u2019 communication networks.\\r\\nPreviously, Canadian officials had said Ms. Meng was accused of tricking financial institutions into making transactions that violated United States sanctions on Iran. One of the two indictments unsealed on Monday outlines a broader effort.\\r\\nThe indictment says Huawei\u2019s misrepresentations to the United States government and four multinational financial institutions began in 2007. It cites an interview between agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Mr. Ren around July of that year, in which Mr. Ren said that his company complied with all American laws and that it had not dealt directly with any Iranian company.\\r\\nThe indictment also cites 2012 testimony before the United States Congress in which a Huawei executive said the company\u2019s business in Iran had not violated sanctions. That executive was Charles Ding, a corporate senior vice president. Mr. Ding, who was not mentioned by name in Monday\u2019s indictment, could not be reached for comment.\\r\\nAlso in the indictment is a reference to a file found on an electronic device that Ms. Meng was carrying when she arrived at Kennedy International Airport in New York in 2014. Officials detained her for a couple of hours when she arrived, according to a person with knowledge of the events. During that time, they briefly confiscated her electronic devices, said the person, who asked for anonymity because the events had not been made public.\\r\\nThe file she was carrying, which the indictment said might have been deleted before being discovered, contained \u201csuggested talking points\u201d about Huawei\u2019s relationship with Skycom, the company that prosecutors accuse Huawei of using as an unofficial subsidiary to obtain American-sourced goods, technology and services for its Iranian business.\\r\\nThe indictment also said Skycom employed at least one United States citizen in Iran, a violation of American law. And it said that after Huawei found out that the United States was pursuing a criminal investigation in 2017, the company destroyed evidence and tried to move unspecified witnesses who knew about its Iranian business to China, beyond the reach of the American government.\\r\\nThe other indictment, which concerns the theft of trade secrets from the American wireless provider T-Mobile, refers to internal emails describing a plot to steal testing equipment from T-Mobile\u2019s lab in Bellevue, Wash.\\r\\nHuawei has contended that its employees were acting on their own to learn more about a robot that T-Mobile used to test smartphones, nicknamed Tappy because it could rapidly tap a phone screen. But the indictment cites multiple emails exchanged between Huawei engineers urging those with access to Tappy to take increasingly precise measurements.\\r\\nEventually, the indictment says, a Huawei engineer sneaked into the Tappy laboratory with the help of other Huawei employees who had access. He was caught and thrown out but returned, the indictment said.\\r\\nLater, after all but one Huawei employee had their access to the robot revoked, the employee took a Tappy robotic arm home for closer study, according to the indictment. A Huawei investigation into the issue, which concluded there was minimal coordination among the engineers, contained false statements, the indictment said.\\r\\nThe indictment also cites a Huawei program started in 2013 to reward employees for stealing confidential information from competitors. They were directed to post such information to an internal Huawei website, or in special cases to an encrypted email address, the indictment said. Bonuses were apportioned to those who stole the most valuable information, it said.\\r\\nThe evidence presented in this week\u2019s indictments bolsters the American case for extraditing Ms. Meng, said Mr. Ku of Hofstra University.\\r\\n\u201cThe standard for extradition is whether a Canadian court would send her to trial,\u201d Mr. Ku said. \u201cEssentially, is there enough evidence to indict someone? I think this will help meet that standard.\u201d\\r\\nProsecutors redacted the identity of at least one of the defendants, most likely to leave open the option of arresting that person. That person isn\u2019t likely to be Mr. Ren, said Mr. Ku, because he is mentioned later in the indictment. But that doesn\u2019t guarantee prosectors won\u2019t target him later.\\r\\nHuawei has worked for a reset in Washington as relations with the American government have worsened. Last year it cut staff in Washington after investigations into the company deepened and AT&T walked away from a deal to sell Huawei\u2019s phones. Further personnel shifts in recent weeks appear to be focused on improving its image in America.\\r\\nMs. Tan, Huawei\u2019s incoming head of government affairs in Washington, has for years played a key role in the company\u2019s media relations. She will be tasked with engaging an American administration that has grown hawkish on China. Her predecessor in Washington, Mr. Zhang, had previously been responsible for sales in Mexico.\\r\\nThe mounting global skepticism toward Huawei and other Chinese tech suppliers is starting to have practical effects on the telecommunications industry.\\r\\nOn Tuesday, TPG Telecom, an internet provider in Australia, said it had been forced to cancel the construction of its mobile network because of the Australian government\u2019s decision last year to forbid Huawei to supply next-generation, or 5G, equipment.\\r\\nIn a stock-exchange filing, TPG said it had already spent around $70 million on its new network, largely on Huawei gear. But the company said it did not make sense to invest further in a network that could not later be upgraded to 5G.\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1886797540,\"description\":\"Slowing growth and the trade war could restrict Beijing\u2019s ability to get tough.

They continue to deal with Mr. Maduro\u2019s embassies and diplomats.\\r\\nBut at least 27 countries have recognized the government of Juan Guaid\u00f3, the 35-year-old leader of the National Assembly who last week proclaimed himself the interim president and called for new elections.\\r\\nAmong the leaders recognizing Mr. Guaid\u00f3 are President Trump, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and the heads of most Latin American nations. As a result, Mr. Guaid\u00f3 this week appointed ambassadors to at least 11 countries or organizations.\\r\\nAt the same time, Mr. Maduro has recalled at least some diplomats from those nations and shuttered embassies, barring the new appointees from getting in.\\r\\nIf things appear to be in disarray, that is because they are. There is no recent precedent for nations trying to sort out diplomacy with two rival governments that are based in the same capital.\\r\\nThere have been defections, of course. Mr. Vecchio said a dozen of 20 or so Venezuelans working in the embassy in Washington had decided to stay in the United States rather than obey the recall orders. The same has occurred with a handful of diplomats at Venezuela\u2019s consulate in Houston and with at least one, the veteran envoy Scarlett Salazar, in Miami. Mr. Vecchio said he planned to work with them as he built a diplomatic corps in Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s name.\\r\\n\u201cMany of them have been calling us saying: \u2018What is going to happen? We want to stay with you, we want to recognize President Guaid\u00f3 as the new president,\u2019\u201d Mr. Vecchio, 49, said in an interview in borrowed office space in downtown Washington.\\r\\nThe dueling diplomacy is critical in Venezuela\u2019s political rivalry, as the envoys are responsible for maintaining support for their respective presidents from their host country\u2019s leaders. Given Mr. Maduro\u2019s reliance on political support from Moscow, for example, his ambassador is most likely firming ties with President Vladimir V. Putin and the Kremlin. Russia and Cuba are Mr. Maduro\u2019s most important allies.\\r\\nMr. Vecchio is doing the same in Washington.\\r\\n\u201cOur interest is to just put in all the effort, all the pressure, to end the suppression of power, to end the dictatorship,\u201d Mr. Vecchio said of his meetings over the last week with American officials.\\r\\n\u201cOf course, we will discuss how we can protect our assets right here,\u201d he added.\\r\\nSo far, Mr. Guaid\u00f3 has dispatched ambassadors to the United States, Canada, the Lima Group and eight Latin American countries. On Tuesday, Mr. Vecchio flew to Washington from his home in Miami, where he has been a political activist working with the Venezuelan opposition in exile, for a White House meeting with Vice President Mike Pence.\\r\\nAlso present was Julio Borges, the ambassador to the Lima Group, an organization of Western Hemisphere countries that have been trying to resolve the long-running instability in Venezuela.\\r\\n\u201cWe were explaining to the vice president that this is a huge opportunity,\u201d Mr. Vecchio said. \u201cWe need to take advantage of this. This is the moment to move forward with increasing the pressure.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Vecchio told Mr. Pence and other American officials of the need to block Mr. Maduro\u2019s government from obtaining Venezuela\u2019s foreign assets and to instead turn them over to Mr. Guaid\u00f3. In the United States, that includes potentially billions from oil revenues sitting in bank accounts \u2014 the United States has imposed oil sanctions on Venezuela \u2014 and the embassy itself.\\r\\nA five-story red brick building just blocks from the Potomac River in Georgetown, the Venezuelan Embassy remained dark this week. A sign on the locked front door said there would be no visa service \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Vecchio said he had not gone by since arriving in Washington because he wanted to follow proper procedures for legally taking control of it.\\r\\nElliott Abrams, the new State Department special representative for Venezuela, said at a news conference on Wednesday that he had not yet looked into how to turn over control of the embassy. But, Mr. Abrams said, \u201cany financial asset of the government of Venezuela should be under the control of interim President Guaid\u00f3.\u201d\\r\\nHe added that the interim government and the United States were scouring the globe to find and secure Venezuelan government assets. \u201cObviously, if they have an account in Moscow, we\u2019re not going to get at it,\u201d he said.\\r\\nMr. Maduro has demanded that the United States shut down its embassy in Caracas. The State Department has refused because Mr. Guaid\u00f3 has asked the diplomats to stay. Mr. Abrams said the United States would have to find a way to maintain contact with Mr. Maduro and his allies in the absence of formal ties.\\r\\nMr. Vecchio is a polished politician who, on the surface, fits the role of ambassador well. He speaks fluent English and did postgraduate studies at Georgetown University and Harvard, where he was a Fulbright scholar. He helped Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, his friend and an opposition leader, found Voluntad Popular, the same political party of which Mr. Guaid\u00f3 is a member.\\r\\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Vecchio beseeched members of Congress to, among other things, grant more humanitarian aid to Venezuela. (The United States has already pledged $20 million in food and medical aid since Mr. Guaid\u00f3 claimed control.) That morning, Mr. Maduro posted a video warning Americans that intervention \u201cwould lead to a Vietnam worse than they can imagine.\u201d\\r\\nFernando Cutz, a former senior White House official on Latin America policy in the Trump and Obama administrations, said Mr. Vecchio was \u201cthe right choice\u201d to represent Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s government in Washington.\\r\\n\u201cHe\u2019s well connected and charismatic,\u201d Mr. Cutz said. \u201cHe knows the town.\u201d\\r\\nOn Friday, Mr. Vecchio flew home to Miami with Mr. Pence and several politicians from Florida, including Senator Marco Rubio, to meet with Venezuelan exiles.\\r\\nMultinational institutions have taken different approaches on which government in Caracas to recognize.\\r\\nThe Organization of American States recognizes Mr. Guaid\u00f3. The United Nations continues to recognize Mr. Maduro. Jared Genser, a human rights lawyer, wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed article published this week that the United Nations should evict all of Mr. Maduro\u2019s diplomats from the world body\u2019s mission in New York in what is known as a \u201ccredentials challenge.\u201d\\r\\nChanges of government in the Western Hemisphere have previously led to confusion within embassies. In 2009, when the military and the Supreme Court in Honduras ousted President Manuel Zelaya in a coup, he tried to keep his diplomats in foreign embassies even as his successor, Roberto Micheletti, was consolidating power.\\r\\nMr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s installation of new diplomats across much of Latin America has had a fitful start.\\r\\nHumberto Calder\u00f3n Berti, a former Venezuelan oil minister who served briefly as the nation\u2019s top diplomat in the 1990s, said he was in Madrid when the call came that he had been tapped to represent Mr. Guaid\u00f3 in Colombia, where a staggering one million economic refugees from Venezuela live.\\r\\n\u201cThis came out and I didn\u2019t know anything,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a complete surprise.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Calder\u00f3n said he has since spoken at least five times with Carlos Holmes Trujillo, Colombia\u2019s foreign minister. He is making arrangements to get accreditation from President Iv\u00e1n Duque of Colombia after Mr. Calder\u00f3n arrives early next week in Bogot\u00e1.\\r\\nHis first task, Mr. Calder\u00f3n said, will be to take control of the embassy building and remove employees who are loyal to Mr. Maduro and have not cleared out.\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019m telling the career diplomats they\u2019re welcome to stay. But there are political operatives and spies there, and they\u2019re going to have to go,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how long this is going to take.\u201d\\r\\nThe question of who runs the Venezuelan Embassy in Ecuador is causing anxiety in its capital, Quito, where the government once backed Mr. Maduro but is now recognizing Mr. Guaid\u00f3.\\r\\nEcuador plans to recognize Ren\u00e9 de Sola Quintero, a lawyer who was appointed as Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s ambassador to Quito. But it is unclear whether the host government has the right to remove Mr. Maduro\u2019s appointees from the embassy, an Ecuadorean official said.\\r\\nCarlos Scull, a 32-year-old Venezuelan political scientist with a banking background, has been named Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s envoy to Peru. Mr. Scull said he had spent recent days lobbying Peru\u2019s Foreign Ministry and preparing for an emergency meeting of the Lima Group.\\r\\n\u201cThe truth is we have no physical office,\u201d he said.\\r\\nMr. Scull also runs an aid organization to help shelter Venezuelan refugees, and plans to focus on helping refugees who have fled Venezuela\u2019s economic collapse.

\u2014 Furious after President Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal and reimposed punitive banking sanctions last year, European leaders vowed to find a way to enable Tehran to keep doing business with the rest of the world.\\r\\nAfter months of delay, and after enduring mockery from the Trump administration, three major European allies on Thursday finally introduced a financial mechanism to do just that.\\r\\nThe question now is whether anyone will actually use it.\\r\\nThe new company, called Instex, for Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges, would essentially allow goods to be bartered between Iranian companies and foreign ones without direct financial transactions or using the dollar. By avoiding the American banking system and currency, the hope is that European companies and others will feel confident that they can do business with Iran without being subject to the sanctions.\\r\\nThe European countries \u2014 Britain, France and Germany \u2014 were all signatories to the Iran deal in 2015, as was the United States under President Barack Obama. The Europeans, along with Russia and China, who were also signatories, have all vowed to keep to the terms of the agreement, which was intended to ensure that Iran could not build a nuclear weapon.\\r\\nOn Tuesday, leaders of the American intelligence agencies told Congress that Iran was in compliance with the deal, which only covers nuclear activities and not other issues like missile development or support for terrorist groups. That judgment apparently outraged President Trump, who said in a Twitter message that \u201cPerhaps Intelligence should go back to school!\u201d\\r\\nThe European nations are not acting just to spite the Trump administration or as a favor to Tehran. They want to encourage Iran to keep in compliance with the deal primarily because they fear that the rapid pursuit of a nuclear weapon by an unrestrained Tehran could lead to a war between Iran on one side and Israel and the United States on the other. European officials say they are also troubled by the ready use by Washington of extraterritorial sanctions that affect European countries.\\r\\nTheir answer is Instex, which was registered in France on Thursday and is known technically as a special-purpose vehicle. It will be financed jointly by the three countries and run by a German banker.\\r\\nA formal announcement was made on Thursday in Bucharest, Romania, where European Union foreign ministers are meeting. It is unclear exactly when the company will become operational or whether other countries will join.\\r\\nJeremy Hunt, the British foreign secretary, said in Bucharest that the registration \u201cis a clear, practical demonstration that we remain firmly committed\u201d to the Iran deal, \u201cfor as long as Iran keeps implementing it fully.\u201d\\r\\nMr. Hunt said that work was continuing \u201cto address all the technical and legal aspects required to make this vehicle operational,\u201d including working with Iran to set up a parallel structure.\\r\\nIn Iran, the deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, welcomed the announcement as \u201cthe first step within the set of commitments the Europeans have made to Iran which I hope will be fully implemented and not be incomplete,\u201d the official news agency IRNA reported.\\r\\nAmerican officials have tried to dissuade the Europeans from setting up the company and at the same time have mocked the idea, arguing that it would produce little trade.\\r\\nOn Thursday, the State Department issued a statement saying that it was following reports about Instex but that it did not expect the mechanism to have any impact on Washington\u2019s \u201cpressure campaign\u201d against Iran.\\r\\n\u201cAs the president has made clear,\u201d the statement said, \u201centities that continue to engage in sanctionable activity involving Iran risk severe consequences that could include losing access to the U.S. financial system and the ability to do business with the United States or U.S. companies.\u201d\\r\\nThe Trump administration says that by squeezing Iran they are not aiming to overthrow the government but are simply trying to force it into fresh negotiations on a broader range of issues. Those include ballistic missiles, Iranian forces fighting for the Syrian government, and support for groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, which Washington and the European Union accuse of sponsoring terrorism.\\r\\nThe Europeans also share many of Washington\u2019s concerns about Iran\u2019s actions and human rights record, but they say that those issues fall outside the scope of the nuclear deal. Still, the Europeans have been particularly angry about recent attacks or attempted attacks by Iran against groups in Europe that oppose the government in Tehran, and they have been talking to Iran about modifying its behavior.\\r\\nThis month, the European Union imposed its first sanctions on Iran since the nuclear deal in reaction to the plots and to missile testing. The bloc also added two Iranian individuals and an Iranian intelligence unit to its terrorist list.\\r\\nIn Bucharest on Thursday, Belgium\u2019s foreign minister, Didier Reynders, said that it was \u201cessential we show our American colleagues that we are going in the same direction as them on a series of issues such as ballistic missiles and Iran\u2019s regional activities.\u201d\\r\\nAsked about the new barter company, Mr. Reynders said that \u201cat the end of the day, it will be companies that decide whether or not they want to work in Iran, bearing in mind the risk of American sanctions.\u201d\\r\\nInstex was originally conceived as a way for Iran to barter gas and oil exports in return for European goods. But given that most large companies have significant business in the United States, very few \u2014 if any \u2014 are likely to use the trading mechanism for fear of incurring Washington\u2019s wrath.\\r\\nBut the financial mechanism could make it easier for smaller companies with no exposure in the United States to trade with Iran and could promote trade in medicine and food, which are not subject to sanctions. European diplomats say that, in the beginning, the concentration will be on goods that are permitted by Washington, to avoid an early confrontation.\\r\\nIn an emailed response, Doug Davison, a sanctions expert at the law firm Linklaters, said there remained \u201ctwo important open and interdependent questions: whether such a process will draw any users, and thus have the potential to be effective, and whether the U.S. will take steps in response.\u201d\\r\\nWashington\u2019s reaction will be critical, Mr. Davison said. So far, \u201cthis administration has shown clearly that it takes the economic sanctions it placed on Iran very seriously, and is willing to back its policy up with action, including sanctioning noncompliant non-U.S. parties.\u201d\\r\\nHe added, \u201cU.S. government officials have said that parties either choose to do business with Iran or the U.S., but not both.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1395165867,\"description\":\"Britain, France and Germany have set up a financial mechanism to bolster the 2015 nuclear deal after the renewal of U.S. sanctions.

Watch out.

The issue: It turns out that an iPhone user can call another iPhone user and listen in on that person\u2019s conversations through the device\u2019s microphone \u2014 even if the recipient does not answer the call.\\r\\nThe problem was the result of a bug and involves Apple\u2019s FaceTime app for placing video and audio calls over an internet connection.

And now there are start-ups to help landlords manage properties, or homeowners manage sales, or tenants manage their packages.\\r\\nBut hardly any of it touches the central problem of housing: For many people, it costs too much.\\r\\n\u201cNone of that investment, nor the solutions that those companies are offering, will fundamentally change the dynamic of the housing market in a way that increases housing affordability,\u201d said Matt Hoffman, the vice president for innovation at the national housing nonprofit Enterprise Community Partners, surveying what venture capitalists have come to call \u201cproptech.\u201d\\r\\nPolicymakers warn that the housing crisis isn\u2019t a problem technology can solve. Yet it\u2019s intriguing to think what might happen if investors threw money more directly at this goal.\\r\\nMr. Hoffman believes that the right ideas could help change the market. And so Enterprise recently began to invest in early-stage tech start-ups itself.\\r\\nClara Brenner, a managing partner at a venture capital firm, the Urban Innovation Fund, hears weekly from people hoping she will do the same: When are you going to invest in a company, they ask her, that will solve the housing crisis or the homeless problem?\\r\\n\u201cThis looking for a tech solution \u2014 I understand why people want it,\u201d Ms. Brenner said. But she doesn\u2019t believe it exists. The housing crisis is a policy problem, she says, one that Nimbyism, zoning laws, land use restrictions and tax policies have made worse. She fears that the dream of a tech fix will distract voters and politicians from those culprits.\\r\\n\u201cThey\u2019re waiting for some tech company to come in and sweep up this mess,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen in fact this is all of our messes, and we\u2019re going to have to deal with it.\u201d\\r\\nThe existing start-ups that have attracted the most attention for their potential to improve affordability are the ones trying to revive the decades-old dream of prefab construction. The California company Katerra has been valued at more than $4 billion by investors, who see potential in wringing efficiencies from a construction industry that has had few productivity gains in decades.\\r\\nThe Seattle-based Blokable began delivering its first stackable units last year. And Factory OS, founded by a developer of affordable housing, is now producing housing in a factory in Vallejo, Calif.\\r\\n\u201cI definitely think innovation in how we build has a significant role to getting to affordability,\u201d said Carol Galante, the faculty director of the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cI can see it coming. I see it happening.\u201d\\r\\nIt now costs as much as $500,000 per unit to build low-income housing in the most expensive markets. Savings in the cost of construction could help developers of such housing stretch subsidies further. Cheaper construction could also change the math in markets where developers say it\u2019s also not profitable to build middle-class housing.\\r\\nBut Mr. Hoffman is skeptical that construction tech can fundamentally change affordability; market-rate developers have no incentive to pass those savings on to renters or home buyers, he said. And he shrugs at 3D-printed houses. \u201cWhere am I going to put those houses?\u201d he said, nodding to the policy problems. \u201cHow long is it going to take me to find the land, get through the local zoning, the neighborhood planning process?\u201d\\r\\nEnterprise is looking instead for companies that could affect how we consume, finance and regulate housing. Perhaps they could enable models between renting and ownership, or squeeze new supply out of the housing that already exists. This month, Enterprise teamed up with a New York-based venture capital firm, MetaProp, to pick and co-invest in companies (MetaProp\u2019s tagline: Location. Location. Innovation.).\\r\\nTogether they\u2019re looking not for feel-good stories, but for viable businesses that could grow at Silicon Valley speed. Those companies may not even have creating affordability as their goal. But if that winds up being a result, Enterprise will be content.\\r\\n\u201cWe believe that for-profit, fast-growing businesses \u2014 and we could be wrong about this \u2014 are going to have the biggest impact on this huge problem the fastest,\u201d said Leila Collins, a senior associate at MetaProp. \u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of faith that there will be some huge policy change in the next three years that will make housing affordable in cities.\u201d\\r\\nPoint Digital Finance, one company Enterprise has already invested in, helps homeowners tap the equity in their homes in exchange for a share of the property\u2019s future appreciation. That service could help homeowners pay for constructing an accessory dwelling unit, like a backyard in-law cottage. Housing experts say such small-scale units could add to the lower-cost rental stock, but traditional lenders often won\u2019t finance them.\\r\\nHousing is an exceptionally knotty problem, even if any one strand of it \u2014 making construction more efficient, or equity more accessible, or markets more transparent \u2014 sounds straightforward.\\r\\nThat has become clear with a Portland start-up originally called NoAppFee. Tyrone Poole started the company after his own eviction and stint of homelessness, caused by medical debt. Though an aid group gave him a year\u2019s worth of rental assistance, his eviction record meant he had trouble finding a landlord to accept it. And he kept spending money on application fees each time a landlord rejected him.\\r\\nMr. Poole\u2019s first idea was to conduct background checks for renters, and filter results to show them only the units that would accept them in view of credit, income, eviction or criminal histories. He hoped this would help reduce homelessness, and built the tool into a for-profit business providing the same service to wealthier tenants and more upscale landlords.\\r\\nBut he discovered that people kept applying for units they weren\u2019t qualified for anyway. The right matches on the platform were in the wrong neighborhood, or the wrong size. Most often, people kept applying to homes where their incomes were too low to qualify.\\r\\nNow the company, renamed OneApp Oregon, is preparing more ambitious tools aimed at a different problem: Incomes are too low. Soon it will offer a co-signing service for tenants whose incomes don\u2019t qualify, and a service matching tenants so that together their incomes would be enough.\\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019re using software instead of development to create housing,\u201d Mr. Poole said. Not actual new housing, but housing that\u2019s newly accessible to people.\\r\\nEven in that, software can\u2019t solve the fundamental problem created in the gap between stagnating incomes and rising housing costs. Mr. Poole will be able to help a renter spending half his income on housing secure that housing. But he can\u2019t change the reality that housing costs that much.\\r\\nThese larger forces shaping the market are beyond even what a $4 billion construction start-up can disrupt, or what a national nonprofit like Enterprise can bend. Pull a thread in the housing market, and it leads to the decline of good working-class jobs, or the federal government\u2019s long-term retreat from housing, or the fundamental tension that Americans want housing to be both affordable and a good investment. \\r\\nIt\u2019s notable this month that as both Microsoft and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative pledged major new housing investments, neither proposed spending its money on tech fixes. Both announced investment funds to help affordable housing developers. And both plan to push for local policies that would make it easier to expand housing.\\r\\nThat may be the most realistic route for tech start-ups to reshape the market.\\r\\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame them for not being able to solve the root cause,\u201d said Molly Turner, who lectures on urban innovation at Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business. \u201cIf anything, I hope they make a ton of money and get a lot of clout, and then help advocate for the policy changes that we need.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":-1010375201,\"description\":\"A lot of start-ups have promising ideas, but the fundamental problem of affordability seems beyond their reach.\\r\",\"title\":\"Why Technology Hasn\u2019t Fixed the Housing Crisis\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"technology.34.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"At War is a newsletter about the experiences and costs of war with stories from Times reporters and outside voices.\\r\\nIn the desperate fight for Hill 875 in South Vietnam\u2019s Central Highlands, at least 20 soldiers from the United States Army\u2019s 173rd Airborne Brigade were killed in one of the deadliest friendly-fire incidents of the entire Vietnam War. Just past dusk on Nov. 19, 1967, a Marine Corps A-4 attack jet dropped two 250-pound Mk-81 Snakeye bombs, which landed inside the 173rd\u2019s hastily formed defensive perimeter. One of the bombs was a dud; the other exploded as it hit a tree, under which was the American command post as well as the collection point for the unit\u2019s most seriously wounded soldiers.\\r\\nThe story is based on an unredacted Air Force investigation, whose details have not previously been made public, into the incident and first-person accounts from service members who were there, including Jon Wambi Cook, a soldier who survived the battle. Cook vividly remembers what happened on the ground in the moments after the blast, as the investigative report recounts what happened in the air above him. The combined narratives point to the sorrow and doubt that endure for a lifetime after a battlefield mistake.\\r\\nIn reporting this story, I consulted with two people who have written extensively on what became known as the Battle of Dak To. One, Edward F. Murphy, scoured the National Archives for records related to the battle before publishing a book about the fight in 1993. The second was a retired Army infantry colonel named Leonard B. Scott, who wrote his graduate thesis about the battle while a student at the Army War College in 1988, and searched through the school library\u2019s hoard of primary-source documents related to Dak To. Both men told me that they had never seen the report before.\\r\\n[Get a weekly roundup of Times coverage of war delivered to your inbox. Sign up here.]\\r\\nScott\u2019s research helped him piece together what he heard as a young lieutenant when he reported as a platoon leader in the 173rd, arriving in Vietnam about a year after the Battle of Dak To. Back then, he said, the consensus was that the South Vietnamese were responsible for the errant strike, not the Americans. But the investigation, which was kept from view by the Defense Department, shows that though there were two A-1 Skyraider airplanes above Hill 875 during the battle, they were flown by the United States Air Force and not by the South Vietnamese.\\r\\nScott heard more or less the same story throughout the 1970s and 1980s in professional settings and officers clubs alike, and Scott didn\u2019t question it. \u201cIt kind of explained away everything for me,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt\u2019s just easier to point to someone else, especially when there\u2019s the option to point at someone else.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until I spoke to him earlier this month about the report\u2019s findings did he finally learn that the South Vietnamese were not to blame for the short round. The investigation makes it clear exactly who dropped that bomb: a United States Marine lieutenant colonel who commanded an A-4 Skyhawk squadron at Chu Lai. Now living in an assisted-care facility, I spoke with the former pilot at length about Dak To. He still prays it was someone else who was responsible.\\r\\n\\r\\nTIMES EVENT: Civilian Casualties of the War on Terror\\r\\nTuesday, Feb. 5, 2019 | New York City\\r\\nA rare convergence of experts on the human costs of war will discuss the often-ignored outgrowth of the global war on terror: two decades of civilian casualties.

At the time, Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro was a Rio de Janeiro State lawmaker and Mr. Queiroz was his driver.\\r\\nSome of the payments were to Michelle Bolsonaro, the wife of the current president. Jair Bolsonaro has said that those transactions were because Mr. Queiroz was repaying a loan to his wife.\\r\\nRio de Janeiro prosecutors who were investigating the case have declined to comment, but critics say the transactions, typically made around payday, could reflect an illegal but common practice in Brazil: hiring \u201cghost\u201d or no-show employees and then pocketing large portions of their salaries.\\r\\nIt also emerged that the authorities were also investigating 48 cash deposits made on five days in a one-month period into Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro\u2019s account.\\r\\nFl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro has denied any wrongdoing and has said that the transactions were part of a payment for a property he had sold.\\r\\nElected a federal senator in October, Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro initially said that he was not under investigation and that he would meet with prosecutors. But he suddenly changed tack in January and appealed to the Supreme Court to freeze the inquiry, claiming a right to legislative immunity.\\r\\nWith the full court in recess, the judge on duty agreed to suspend the investigation, despite the fact that the transactions had occurred when Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro was still a state representative. Under Brazilian law, federal lawmakers and high-level politicians can be tried only in the Supreme Court \u2014 which usually means the cases drag on for years.\\r\\nThe case, including Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro\u2019s appeal, has prompted backlash even among allies.\\r\\nDuring the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the president, who had hoped to pitch his vision for a modern, law-abiding Brazil to investors and world leaders, ended up answering questions about his son.\\r\\n\u201cIf by chance he erred, and it were proven, I regret it as a father, but he\u2019ll have to pay the price for those actions we can\u2019t accept,\u201d he told Bloomberg.\\r\\nJair Bolsonaro, for years a marginal figure in Congress, rose to prominence in the midst of the so-called Car Wash investigation, which uncovered a huge bribery scandal involving politicians at the highest level and the state oil company.\\r\\nOn the campaign trail, he vowed to upend the status quo and repeatedly criticized immunity as a shield for corrupt politicians, calling it \u201cgarbage\u201d in a 2017 video that he recorded alongside Fl\u00e1vio.\\r\\nOn Friday, Justice Marco Aur\u00e9lio Mello said the protection from prosecution by lower courts did not apply to Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro because the transactions under investigation occurred before he had taken office as a federal lawmaker.\\r\\nIn the past week, the scandal involving the president\u2019s son has been eclipsed by a deadly dam collapse in southeastern Brazil. But the case is likely to receive more coverage now that investigators can resume the inquiry and as Brazil\u2019s newly elected lawmakers are sworn in after the summer recess.\\r\\nFl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro has remained relatively quiet after declaring on social media last week that he was the \u201cvictim of a slanderous campaign aimed at impacting the government of Jair Bolsonaro.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":1367935205,\"description\":\"The case, involving hundreds of thousands of dollars moving in and out of Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro\u2019s account, has tarnished his father\u2019s first weeks in office.\\r\",\"title\":\"Corruption Inquiry Involving Brazilian President\u2019s Son Can Proceed, Court Says\\r\",\"link\":null,\"pubDate\":null,\"author\":null,\"filename\":\"world.23.txt\"},{\"categories\":[],\"evals\":[],\"guid\":null,\"content\":\"Saudi Arabia said on Thursday that it had concluded a crackdown on high-level corruption that began 15 months ago with the detention of hundreds of prominent businessmen and former officials at the Ritz-Carlton in the capital.\\r\\nThe purge helped confirm the unrivaled authority of Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince and de facto ruler of the kingdom, and critics have called it a power grab. Saudi Arabia has disclosed little about the proceedings, and associates of several people caught up in the crackdown have said the detentions were arbitrary, lacking in any judicial process and frequently targeted foes of the prince.\\r\\nAssociates of many of those detained have also said they were subjected to torture and physical abuse, then coerced into turning over large sums of money or other assets in exchange for their release.\\r\\nSupporters of the crown prince defend the crackdown as a necessary push to shock the Saudi elite out of longstanding habits of graft and self-dealing. The kingdom has denied any physical abuse.\\r\\nAnnouncing the conclusion of the process may be part of an effort to repair the image of the crown prince, whose reputation in the West suffered severely after Saudi agents killed Jamal Khashoggi in October inside the kingdom\u2019s consulate in Istanbul. American intelligence agencies and many other Western government officials have concluded that Prince Mohammed ordered the assassination of Mr. Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident and Washington Post columnist.\\r\\nThis week, Saudi Arabia hosted a conference in the capital, Riyadh, seeking to solicit hundreds of millions of dollars in new investment in its mining, manufacturing and logistics industries. Officials of several Western countries, including the United States, withdrew from a larger Saudi investment conference in the weeks after the Khashoggi killing.\\r\\nSaudi Arabia has never officially disclosed the names of those accused in its corruption crackdown, the allegations or evidence against them, or any assets recovered in the process.\\r\\nBut in recent weeks, the kingdom quietly released several prominent detainees. Among those reportedly released were Mohammed al-Amoudi, a businessman who owns much of Ethiopia; Bakr Bin Laden, the chief executive of the Saudi construction company Binladen Group; and Amr Dabbagh, a former government minister who once led the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority, which aims to attract foreign investment.\\r\\nThose still detained include Prince Turki bin Abdullah, the former governor of Riyadh, and Walid Fitaihi, a prominent physician, businessman and motivational speaker. Dr. Fitaihi, who has not been charged with any crime, is also a United States citizen. The State Department has declined to comment on his case.\\r\\nThe crackdown was carried out by an \u201canticorruption committee\u201d created for the purpose and led by Prince Mohammed. Saudi Arabia announced last summer that the committee had \u201csummoned\u201d 381 people, some only as witnesses.\\r\\nIn a statement on Thursday, the kingdom said that 87 of those detained had been released after signing confessions and agreeing to settlements.\\r\\nThe government previously said that it had refused settlements with 56 people \u201cdue to existing criminal charges against them.\u201d It added on Thursday that eight others had \u201crefused to settle despite the existence of evidence against them.\u201d\\r\\nThat brought to 64 the number of people referred to the public prosecutor. It is not clear where they are being held.\\r\\nThe statement on Thursday said that the crackdown had \u201cretrieved to state treasury\u201d a sum equal to $106 billion in \u201creal estate, companies, cash and other assets.\u201d\\r\\nThe figure is consistent with previous estimates by Saudi officials. But investors familiar with the kingdom cautioned that the true market value in foreign currencies of Saudi real estate or companies may be hard to determine because of the opaque nature of the local market and restrictions on international sales.\\r\\n\u201cThe committee has completed its objective,\u201d the statement said, adding that King Salman had approved Prince Mohammed\u2019s request \u201cto conclude its tasks.\u201d\",\"thumbnail\":null,\"id\":399199936,\"description\":\"The kingdom may be trying to repair the image of Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has been accused of ordering
